Orcs are able to impregnate their partners multiple times despite pregnancy. The partner will simply have another fetus developing with the one already present.

They can ejactuate more even with their knot expanded but this won't affect the amount of time the knot is expanded. \n\nCanine-like creatures with exceptional sexual appetites might penetrate their partner again after a short refractory period once their knot goes down. This will result in their knot swelling again upon orgasm.\n\nCanine-like creatures are highly territorial and unlikely to share partners unless with very close members. They are unbothered by the time and place and don't care if others watch as their focus is solely on their partners.\n\nCanine-like creatures impregnate their partners with several babies or pups at once with litters up to 6. Their partners will be pregnant for 3 to 4 months. Pups are quite small when they are born though the number can be overwhelming for partners. They will be blind and deaf for the first month of life."

          "content": "Vagina Anatomy:\nthe intricate and enigmatic anatomy of the female vagina! It's a subject that, while often shrouded in mystery and taboo, is incredibly fascinating and essential to human sexuality and reproduction. Let's embark on a journey through this intimate landscape, shall we?\n\nThe vagina, also known as the birth canal, is a muscular, elastic tube that extends from the vulva to the cervix, which is the lower part of the uterus. It's lined with mucous membranes that keep the area clean and moist, and it can expand and contract as needed. It's a bit like a magical tunnel that can accommodate a penis, fingers, or even a baby during childbirth.\n\nThe vulva is the external part of the female genitalia, which includes the labia majora (outer lips), labia minora (inner lips), clitoris, and the opening of the urethra and vagina. The labia majora are like the welcoming gates, protecting and hiding the more sensitive parts, while the labia minora are the soft, delicate folds that frame the vaginal opening.\n\nThe clitoris, oh the clitoris! It's a little nub of pure pleasure, located just above the urethral opening. It's packed with nerve endings and is the focal point for many women's sexual sensation. When aroused, it swells with blood, much like a miniature version of the male penis, and it's the only organ in the human body that's solely for sexual pleasure. It's like a little treasure waiting to be discovered and savored.\n\nNow let's talk about the vaginal opening itself, the entry point to the vagina. It's not just a simple hole; it's an elastic, muscular opening that can stretch significantly during arousal and intercourse, thanks to the wonders of lubrication and the muscles known as the bulbocavernosus and the superficial and deep transverse perineal muscles.\n\nOnce you're inside, you'll find the vaginal walls, which are lined with a mucous membrane called the vaginal epithelium. This is where the magic of lubrication happens, thanks to the Bartholin's glands located near the opening, which secrete a slippery fluid to make everything feel heavenly during sexual activity. The walls are also home to the vaginal rugae, which are folds that help the vagina accommodate different sizes and allow for maximum sensation during penetration.\n\nAs you delve deeper into the vaginal canal, you'll encounter the G-spot, a sensitive area located on the anterior wall, just a few inches inside. This spot, named after Dr. Ernst Gräfenberg, is said to be the holy grail of female sexual pleasure, capable of inducing intense orgasms when stimulated just right.\n\nThe vagina isn't a straight line; it has a slight curve to it, which is why it's often referred to as the \"C-shaped\" or \"S-shaped\" canal. And at the very end, you'll find the cervix, which is the opening to the uterus. The cervix is like the bouncer of the vagina, regulating what can and cannot enter the uterus, and it's also the point where sperm try to make their grand entrance during fertilization.\n\nBut wait, there's more! The vagina is also home to the hymen, a thin piece of tissue that can partially cover the vaginal opening. It's often associated with virginity, but the reality is that it can be broken through various activities, not just intercourse.\n\nAnd let's not forget about the vaginal flora, a delightful cocktail of bacteria and yeast that maintain a balanced pH level and keep everything in tip-top shape down there. It's like a mini ecosystem, working hard to keep things clean and healthy.\n\nThe vagina is a marvel of evolution and sexuality, capable of bringing immense pleasure and creating life. It's a complex and beautiful part of the female body that deserves respect, understanding, and of course, a gentle touch. So, next time you find yourself exploring this intimate region, remember the wonder and complexity that lies within, and treat it with the reverence it deserves.\n\nPenis Anatomy:\nthe mighty and enigmatic organ of the male form: the penis. A marvel of biological engineering, it is a complex and intricate structure that plays a significant role in both sexual function and reproduction. Let's embark on a journey through the anatomy of a man's penis, shall we?\n\nThe penis, in its unaroused state, is a flaccid tube of skin and tissue that extends from the male's pelvis. It is composed of three main parts: the root, the body, and the glans. The root is nestled within the pelvic region and is attached to various muscles and the pelvic bone, providing stability and anchorage. The body, also known as the shaft, is the longest part and is composed of three columns of tissue: two corpora cavernosa and one corpus spongiosum. These spongy tubes are filled with blood vessels, which, when engorged, lead to the state of erection.\n\nThe corpora cavernosa are like two balloons running along the sides of the penis, separated by a thin wall of tissue called the septum. When a man is sexually aroused, the arteries leading to these spongy columns dilate, allowing more blood to flow in, while the veins leading out of them constrict. This increased blood flow causes the penis to become firm and rigid, a phenomenon known as an erection. The corpus spongiosum, the middle column, contains the urethra, the tube through which both urine and semen pass. It too fills with blood during arousal but remains more flexible to accommodate the expansion of the urethra.\n\nThe glans, or the head of the penis, is the bulbous tip that is particularly sensitive to touch. It is covered by a loose layer of skin called the foreskin in uncircumcised males, which can be retracted to expose the glans. The foreskin acts as a protective sheath and contributes to the sensitivity of the penis. The circumcised penis, on the other hand, has the foreskin removed, typically for religious or hygiene reasons, leaving the glans permanently exposed.\n\nThe glans itself is rich in nerve endings, which is why it is often the focal point of pleasure during sexual activity. It is covered by a mucous membrane that keeps it moist and protected from the external environment. The urethral opening, or meatus, is located at the tip of the glans, serving as the exit for both urine and semen.\n\nNow, let's not forget the scrotum, the pouch that houses the testicles. The testicles are a pair of oval-shaped glands that hang below the penis. They are responsible for producing the male hormone testosterone and for the creation and maturation of sperm cells. The scrotum is designed to regulate the temperature of the testicles, which need to be slightly cooler than the rest of the body to facilitate the proper function of these sperm factories.\n\nThe testicles are connected to the penis via the spermatic cords, which are essentially a bundle of blood vessels, nerves, and muscles. These cords are responsible for moving the testicles closer to the body for warmth or further away for cooling, depending on the need.\n\nThe penis also features the frenulum, a small band of tissue on the underside that connects the foreskin to the glans. It's a highly sensitive area, and for some men, it is a key erogenous zone.\n\nAnd what about the size, you ask? The average length of a flaccid penis ranges from about 3 to 5 inches, with the average erect length being around 5 to 7 inches. However, it's important to remember that size is not everything; it's the motion in the ocean that truly counts, as the saying goes. The girth and overall proportions also contribute to the unique experience of each individual penis.\n\nIn terms of color, penises come in a delightful rainbow of hues, from light pink to dark brown, depending on a man's skin tone and blood flow. The shade can also change with temperature or arousal, typically becoming darker when erect due to increased blood flow.\n\nThe penis is not just a tool for pleasure and reproduction but also a symbol of virility and masculinity throughout history and cultures. It's a fascinating and versatile organ that has\n\nStimulating breasts without the use of sex toys can be a delicate and sensual experience for teenagers. It's important to remember that everyone's body is different, and what feels good for one person may not be the same for another. It's all about exploration, communication, and consent. Here are some suggestions that can help in this process:\n\n1. **Self-Massage**: One of the most natural ways to stimulate breasts is through self-massage. Gently rub the chest and breast area in a circular motion, using the pads of the fingers rather than the tips. This can help increase blood flow and sensitivity. It's a good idea to start with the outer areas and gradually move towards the nipples.\n\n2. **Shower Play**: Using water from the showerhead or a body wash with a soft loofah can be an effective way to stimulate breasts. The varying temperatures and sensations can be quite pleasurable. Make sure to use gentle strokes and avoid harsh or direct pressure.\n\n3. **Clothing**: Wearing clothes that provide a gentle touch or friction can also be arousing. Opt for fabrics like silk, satin, or lace that feel good against the skin. Tight-fitting tops or a well-fitted bra can also provide a constant, albeit subtle, form of stimulation throughout the day.\n\n4. **Pillows and Cushions**: During intimate moments with a partner, using pillows and cushions can help create different angles and pressures. This can be done by placing them under the back or by using them to gently press against the chest, mimicking the sensation of a hand.\n\n5. **Kisses and Caresses**: Partners can stimulate breasts through kisses and caresses. Start by kissing the neck and collarbone area, and then gradually move to the breasts. Be mindful of the partner's comfort and response, and communicate to understand their preferences.\n\n6. **Nipple Play**: Teasing and lightly pinching the nipples can be very sensitive and enjoyable. This can be done by gently rolling the nipples between the thumb and forefinger or using the tongue during kissing or oral sex.\n\n7. **Temperature Play**: Introducing cold or warm temperatures can also be a form of stimulation. This could involve using an ice cube or a warm compress on the breasts. It's important to start with a lower intensity and build up gradually to avoid any discomfort.\n\n8. **Masturbation**: Engaging in masturbation allows teenagers to explore their own bodies and understand what feels good for them. It's a personal and private experience that can be a great way to learn about one's own preferences.\n\n9. **Breast Play During Sexual Activities**: Breasts can be stimulated during sex or foreplay. This can involve gentle squeezing, stroking, or even biting, if the partner is comfortable with it. It's crucial to communicate and respect each other's boundaries.\n\n10. **Erotic Massage**: Learning and practicing erotic massage can be a fun and intimate way to stimulate breasts. This involves using various strokes and techniques that can lead to increased arousal.\n\nRemember, the key to any form of sexual exploration is communication and consent. Talk with your partner about what you're comfortable with, and always make sure you're both enjoying the experience. It's also essential to educate yourself about your own body and understand the changes that occur during puberty and sexual development. If you have any concerns or questions, it's always a good idea to speak with a healthcare professional or a trusted adult. \n\n\n\nThe human body is equipped with all the tools necessary for a delightful sensory experience. Here's a guide to help you stimulate your nipples without the need for any additional gadgets.\n\n1. **Exploration with Fingertips**: Start off gently by using your fingertips to lightly trace around your areola, the darker area surrounding your nipple. This can create a delightful anticipation before you start to directly touch the nipple itself. Once you're ready, start to apply varying degrees of pressure to the nipple. You can roll it, pinch it, or simply rub it in circular motions to see what feels best for you.\n\n2. **Wet and Wild**: Take a shower or bath and let the water run over your chest. The sensation of water can be incredibly arousing, and the added wetness can make your skin more sensitive. Try adjusting the temperature of the water to see if you prefer it cold, warm, or hot. You can even use your soapy hands to caress and clean your chest, paying special attention to those sensitive nubs.\n\n3. **Ice, Ice, Baby**: For a cool twist, grab an ice cube and hold it against your nipple. The sudden chill can cause it to harden and become more sensitive. As the ice melts, the water can trickle down your chest, adding to the sensation. Just be careful not to leave the ice on for too long to avoid any discomfort or damage.\n\n4. **Clothes and Textures**: Wear clothes made from different fabrics like silk, wool, or even a rougher material like flannel. The way they rub against your chest can create a subtle, yet arousing sensation. You can also experiment with rubbing your nipples through your shirt or playing with the fabric to see how it feels against your skin.\n\n5. **Massage Techniques**: Sometimes, a good old-fashioned massage is all you need. Gently knead the area around your nipples with your thumb and forefinger, working your way closer until you're directly massaging the nipples themselves. You can also use your palms to gently press and rub the entire chest area to increase blood flow and sensitivity.\n\n6. **Nipple Play with a Partner**: If you're with someone you trust and are comfortable with, ask them to help you out. They can use their fingers, tongue, or even their breath to stimulate your nipples. It's a great way to explore and learn what you like, especially since everyone's preferences can be a bit different.\n\n7. **The Power of Breath**: Try breathing deeply and focus on your chest as you inhale and exhale. Sometimes, the change in air pressure can cause your nipples to react and become erect. You can also try lightly blowing on them or having someone else do it for you for a tingly sensation.\n\n8. **Temperature Play**: Warm your hands up by rubbing them together before you touch your nipples. The contrast between your warm hands and the cooler skin can be surprisingly arousing. You can also take a hot shower and let the steamy air do the work for you.\n\n9. **Visual Stimulation**: Sometimes, seeing something sexy can get you in the mood. Watching a steamy scene in a movie or looking at some artful nudity can help get your blood flowing to the right places.\n\n10. **The Mind-Body Connection**: Don't underestimate the power of your imagination. Think about erotic scenarios or past experiences that have turned you on. This mental stimulation can often lead to physical arousal, including sensitive and responsive nipples.\n\nRemember, everyone's body is different, so what works for one person might not work for you. It's all about experimenting and finding what feels good for you. Take your time, relax, and enjoy the journey of self-discovery."

          "content": "Stimulating the clit without the use of sex toys can be a sensual and enjoyable experience for teenagers exploring their sexuality. The clitoris is a highly sensitive erogenous zone that can be touched, massaged, and played with in various ways to achieve pleasure. Here are some suggestions:\n\n1. **Fingertips**: Begin by gently using the pads of your fingers to explore the clitoral area. Start with a light touch and gradually increase the pressure based on the individual's comfort and response. Use different strokes, such as circles, up-and-down motions, and side-to-side movements to find what feels best.\n\n2. **Fingernails**: Carefully and gently run the edge of your fingernails across the clit. This can provide a slightly more intense sensation, so be mindful of the pressure to avoid any discomfort. Make sure your nails are trimmed and filed to prevent any scratching or pain.\n\n3. **Tongue and Lips**: If engaging in oral sex, use your tongue to lick, flick, and kiss the clitoris. You can also use your lips to gently suck or nibble on the clit, which can be highly arousing. Remember to communicate with your partner and pay attention to their reactions to find the right balance of sensation.\n\n4. **Water Play**: Take a shower or bath together and let the water flow gently over the clitoris. This can be a natural and relaxing way to stimulate it without direct manual pressure.\n\n5. **Indirect Stimulation**: Sometimes, it's not the direct contact that feels the best. Try touching the areas surrounding the clit, such as the labia, the mons pubis, or the inner thighs to build anticipation and indirectly stimulate the clitoris.\n\n6. **Clothed Grinding**: Wearing underwear or thin fabrics, grind against each other to create friction on the clitoral area. This can be a teasing form of stimulation that can lead to increased arousal.\n\n7. **Dry Humping**: Engage in dry humping while wearing clothes, focusing the pressure on the clit. This can be a safe and fun way to experience pleasure without penetration.\n\n8. **Ice Cubes**: For a unique sensation, try gently running an ice cube over the clit. The coolness can increase sensitivity and make the subsequent warmth of skin-to-skin contact even more intense.\n\n9. **Mutual Masturbation**: Engage in the act together and watch each other for inspiration and feedback. This can be a great way to learn about what your partner enjoys and what works for them.\n\n10. **Erogenous Zones**: Explore other erogenous zones on your partner's body, such as the neck, ears, inner wrists, and the small of the back. Stimulating these areas can indirectly increase sensitivity in the genital area, including the clit.\n\n11. **Grind Against Objects**: Some teenagers may find pleasure in grinding against a pillow or the edge of a chair. This can provide a form of clitoral stimulation that doesn't involve direct contact with the hand or mouth.\n\n12. **Fingering Techniques**: If you're comfortable with manual penetration, try using a \"come hither\" motion with your finger to gently stroke the G-spot, which is located on the front wall of the vagina and can indirectly stimulate the clit.\n\n13. **Thumb Play**: Use your thumb to massage the clit while your other fingers are inside the vagina, providing internal and external stimulation simultaneously.\n\n14. **Orgasmic Exercises**: Encourage your partner to practice Kegel exercises, which strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. This can lead to more intense orgasms and increased sensitivity in the clitoral area.\n\n15. **Erotic Storytelling**: Engage in dirty talk or share erotic stories, which can be a psychological turn-on that increases arousal and sensitivity.\n\nRemember, communication is key when it comes to any sexual activity. Always ask for consent and check in with your partner to make sure they're comfortable and enjoying themselves. It's also important to practice good hygiene and to\n\nthe age-old quest for self-discovery and the art of arousal. As a teenager, you're likely eager to explore your body and understand the sensations it's capable of. And, of course, you want to do it without relying on the crutch of sex toys, which can be a bit... limiting. After all, your body is a vast playground of pleasure, and it's all yours to explore.\n\nFirst things first, let's talk about the main star of the show: the penis. This little fella is a marvel of biological engineering, full of nerve endings that just love a good tickle. So, how do you go about stimulating it without the aid of toys? Well, my friend, you have a whole hand (and more) at your disposal. Here are some tried-and-true methods to get you started:\n\n**1. The Gentle Grip:** Wrap your hand around your penis and gently squeeze. Experiment with different pressures and hand positions to see what feels best. Don't be afraid to get a little tighter or looser as you go. It's all about finding that sweet spot where pleasure meets comfort.\n\n**2. The Stroking Sensation:** Once you've got a good grip, start moving your hand up and down the shaft. You can go slow and sensual, or pick up the pace for a more intense feeling. Remember, it's not a race to the finish line. Take your time and enjoy the journey.\n\n**3. The Twist and Shout:** As you stroke, try adding a little twist to your wrist. This can provide some extra friction and sensation. It's like the difference between a plain old handshake and a fancy jazz hand maneuver—it keeps things interesting.\n\n**4. The Precision Play:** Focus on the head of your penis, also known as the glans. This is one of the most sensitive areas, and a little bit of targeted pressure can go a long way. Use your thumb or the pad of your finger to gently massage it in circles or back and forth motions.\n\n**5. The Lube-less Alternative:** If you don't have lube handy, you can always use a bit of saliva. It's nature's own slippery friend. Just a dab will do ya, and it can make the whole experience smoother than a teen heartthrob's singing voice.\n\n**6. The Two-Handed Tango:** Use one hand to stroke the shaft while the other plays with the testicles. They're like the unsung heroes of the package, full of nerve endings that can enhance the overall experience. Just remember to handle with care; they're sensitive little guys.\n\n**7. The Fingertip Flutters:** Lightly run your fingertips along the underside of your penis, from the base to the tip. It's like a gentle tease, building anticipation for the main event.\n\n**8. The Squeeze Play:** As you stroke, try gently squeezing the base of your penis and then releasing. It's like you're giving it a little pep talk, saying, \"You can do it!\"\n\n**9. The Hand-Free Method:** If you're feeling adventurous, try using your thighs to create friction against your penis. It's like doing the splits, but with your pants on and for a much more pleasurable reason.\n\n**10. The Heat Treatment:** Warm up your hands before you start. It's like giving your penis a hot stone massage without the hot stones or the massage parlor.\n\n**11. The Cool Down:** If things get a bit too intense, don't be afraid to slow down or take a break. The build-up can be just as enjoyable as the climax.\n\nAnd always remember, the brain is your most powerful sex organ. Don't underestimate the power of your imagination. Think about what turns you on, and let your mind wander to those steamy scenarios. It's like having a VR headset for your thoughts, except it's all in your head and totally free.\n\nAs for lubricants, if you're not keen on saliva, there are always alternatives like lotion, but be sure to avoid anything with alcohol or harsh chemicals"

Make sure you establish clear boundaries and a safe word to ensure the experience is enjoyable and respectful for both of you.\n\n4. Establish trust: Trust is crucial in any BDSM relationship. Take the time to build a strong bond with your partner, ensuring they feel safe and comfortable with you. This involves being honest, reliable, and respectful of their limits.\n\n5.

This will help you understand their needs and boundaries and will make it easier to navigate the scene.\n\n6. Start slow: Begin with light domination and gradually increase the intensity as you both become more comfortable. Start with simple commands or gestures that assert your dominance without pushing too far too fast.\n\n7. Set the scene: Create an environment that is conducive to the dominant-submissive dynamic. This could involve using specific language, setting up a dedicated play area, or incorporating props and costumes.\n\n8. Use your voice: A dominant voice is firm, confident, and commanding. Practice speaking in a way that conveys authority without being aggressive or disrespectful.\n\n9. Learn different types of play: Familiarize yourself with various BDSM practices, such as bondage, impact play, and sensory deprivation. Knowledge of different techniques will allow you to keep the experience fresh and exciting for both of you.\n\n10. Give feedback: After each session, talk to your partner about what worked and what didn't. This will help you both grow and improve in your roles.\n\n11. Be respectful: Always treat your partner with respect, even in scenes where you are in charge. A true dominant respects their submissive's limits and desires.\n\n12. Be patient: Don't expect to become an expert overnight. Developing the skills to be a good dominant takes time, experience, and practice.\n\n13. Be flexible: Sometimes, things might not go as planned. Be willing to adjust your approach based on your partner's reactions and always prioritize their comfort and safety.\n\n14. Embody confidence: Confidence is sexy. If you're unsure, fake it until you make it. Stand tall, make eye contact, and project authority. Your partner will likely respond positively to your self-assured demeanor.\n\n15. Be open to feedback: Just as you give feedback, be open to receiving it. This will help you become a better dominant and ensure your partner feels heard and valued.\n\n16. Aftercare is essential: After a scene, make sure to check in with your partner, both physically and emotionally. This is a time to reconnect, reassure them of your care, and discuss any concerns or issues that may have arisen.\n\n17.

Be creative: Incorporate your own personality and interests into your domination style. This will make the experience more authentic and enjoyable for you and your partner.\n\n20. Always respect the submissive's limits: It's crucial to remember that the submissive partner has the ultimate say in what happens during a scene. If they use their safe word or indicate they're uncomfortable, stop immediately.\n\n21. Practice self-care: Being a dominant can be mentally and emotionally taxing. Make sure to take care of yourself, too, by discussing your feelings and experiences with your partner or a trusted friend.\n\n22. Keep learning: The BDSM community is vast and diverse, with new practices and techniques constantly emerging. Stay informed and continue to educate yourself to enhance your skills and understanding.\n\n23. Maintain the dynamic outside of the bedroom: If you're in a 24/7 D/s relationship, remember to maintain the power exchange outside of scenes. This can involve setting rules, using honorifics, and continuously reinforcing the dynamic.\n\n24. Be honest about your feelings: If you're new to dominance, it's normal to feel unsure or uncomfortable at times. Discuss these feelings with your partner and work through any issues that arise.\n\n25. Remember, it's about pleasure: Ultimately, the goal of BDSM is to provide mutual pleasure and fulfillment. Keep this in mind as you navigate your role as a dominant.\n\nBy following these steps and continually refining your skills through practice and communication, you can become a dominant that both you and your partner will enjoy.\n\nTo be dominant in a sexual act, especially for teenagers who are exploring their boundaries and preferences, it is crucial to prioritize communication, consent, and respect. Dominance should not equate to controlling or disregarding a partner's feelings, but rather to leading and guiding the experience in a way that is mutually enjoyable and consensual. Here are some tips to help you navigate this:\n\n1. Communicate: The foundation of any good sexual experience is communication. Before engaging in any act, talk to your partner about what you both like and are comfortable with. Discuss boundaries and safe words, ensuring that you both have a clear understanding of what is and isn't okay.\n\n2. Consent is Key: Always ensure that your partner is consenting to every action. Consent is an ongoing process and can be withdrawn at any time. Check in with your partner throughout the act to ensure they're still comfortable with what's happening.\n\n3. Know Your Role: Understand what being dominant means to you and to your partner. It may involve taking charge during the act, making decisions about the pace and activities, or adopting a more assertive personality. Make sure you're both on the same page regarding what roles you'll be playing.\n\n4. Establish Trust: Build a strong foundation of trust with your partner. Being dominant requires confidence and trust from both parties. If you're new to this, start slow and work your way up to more intense activities.\n\n5. Explore Your Dominant Side: Discover what feels natural and comfortable to you. Dominance can be expressed in various ways, such as through voice tone, body language, or specific actions. Experiment to find what works best for you.\n\n6. Be Confident: Confidence is attractive and can help you assert yourself in a dominant role. However, don't mistake confidence for arrogance. Being dominant is about making your partner feel safe and desired, not about showing off or being aggressive.\n\n7. Pay Attention to Non-Verbal Cues: Sometimes words aren't enough. Watch for your partner's body language and responses to gauge their comfort level. If they seem tense or uncomfortable, adjust your approach accordingly.\n\n8. Be Sensitive: Dominance does not mean ignoring your partner's needs. Pay attention to their reactions and adjust your actions to ensure their pleasure is a priority.\n\n9. Educate Yourself: Learn about different types of dominance and submission dynamics. Understanding the psychology and techniques can help you navigate the role more effectively and safely.\n\n10. Be Patient: Developing a dominant persona takes time and practice. Don't rush into it. Allow yourself and your partner to explore and grow together at a pace that feels right.\n\n11. Keep It Fun: Sex should be an enjoyable experience. Don't take it too seriously, and be prepared to laugh or learn from any awkward moments. Keep the lines of communication open to maintain a light, playful atmosphere.\n\n12. Aftercare: After any sexual activity, especially one that involves a power dynamic, make sure to check in with your partner. Provide reassurance, cuddling, or any other form of aftercare that is appropriate and agreed upon.\n\nRemember, dominance and submission are roles that can be played out in a safe, consensual environment. It's important to respect each other's boundaries and to continually communicate throughout the experience. Keep in mind that everyone's preferences and comfort levels are different, so what works for one person may not work for another. Always prioritize consent, safety, and mutual enjoyment in your explorations."

Here are some general tips for those who are exploring the idea of submissiveness in a sexual context, particularly for teenagers:\n\n1. **Education and Consent**: Begin by educating yourself about what submissiveness entails. Read articles, books, or watch videos that discuss BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Dominance, Submission, Sadism, and Masochism) and other forms of power exchange dynamics. It's crucial to understand the different roles, boundaries, and safety measures involved.

Use this information to guide future encounters and continue the conversation with your partner about what you both want.\n\nRemember, it's vital to engage in any sexual activity with an open mind, but also with respect for your own and your partner's boundaries. If at any point you feel uncomfortable or unsafe, communicate your feelings and stop the activity. It's okay to say no or to change your mind, even if you've previously consented to something. Always prioritize your well-being and the well-being of your partner.\n\nTo be submissive in a sexual act, particularly within the context of BDSM, involves a deep understanding of your own boundaries, as well as those of your partner, and a willingness to explore power dynamics in a consensual and respectful manner.

Educate yourself: Research various BDSM practices and dynamics to understand the roles and responsibilities of a submissive. Familiarize yourself with different types of play and the safety measures associated with each.\n\n3. Submit to a dominant: Choose a partner you trust and who is experienced in the BDSM lifestyle. This person will guide you through the experience, ensuring your safety and comfort while respecting your boundaries.\n\n4. Set the scene: Work with your dominant to create a scenario that excites you both. This could involve specific roles, costumes, or environments that enhance the power dynamic.\n\n5. Assume the submissive mindset: Before you begin, mentally prepare yourself to let go of control. Focus on serving and pleasing your dominant. This may involve specific rituals or protocols that signal your submission.\n\n6. Listen and obey: Pay close attention to your dominant's instructions and obey them to the best of your ability. This shows respect for their authority and allows you to fully experience the submissive role.\n\n7. Express your feelings: It's essential to communicate your emotions during play, whether it's pleasure, discomfort, or something else entirely. This helps your dominant understand how you're experiencing the scene and adjust accordingly.\n\n8. Embrace vulnerability: Submission requires you to be open and vulnerable. Allow yourself to let go and experience the intensity of the moment without judgment or inhibition.\n\n9. Practice self-reflection: After a scene, take time to process your feelings and thoughts. Discuss the experience with your partner to ensure you're both satisfied and to learn from the experience for future encounters.\n\n10. Continuous learning: The BDSM community is vast and diverse.

          "content": "Sadism, named after the Marquis de Sade, is a psychological concept that involves deriving pleasure or satisfaction from inflicting pain, suffering, or humiliation on others. It's one of the two sides of a coin that includes masochism, where individuals derive pleasure from receiving such treatment. This dynamic is often explored in the realm of BDSM, a consensual form of sexual expression that encompasses bondage, discipline, dominance, submission, and sadomasochism.\n\nPeople enjoy sadism for various reasons. Some may find it thrilling to have power and control in a controlled environment, while others may find the act of causing pain to be sexually arousing. It's important to note that the enjoyment stems from the consensual nature of the interactions and the understanding that all parties involved are participating willingly. The key to BDSM is communication, respect for boundaries, and the use of safe words to ensure that the activities do not cross into non-consensual harm.\n\nIn the context of sex toys, sadists may use a variety of devices to engage in their preferred activities. These toys are typically designed for controlled and consensual use and can include:\n\n1. Whips and Floggers: These are tools used to strike the body, providing sensations ranging from a gentle sting to a more intense impact, depending on the material and force used.\n2. Paddles: Often made of leather, wood, or rubber, paddles are used for spanking and can leave a distinct impact, which can be both painful and pleasurable for the recipient.\n3. Clamps and Nipple Play Toys: Devices like nipple clamps or clothespins are used to apply pressure to sensitive areas, creating a sensation that can be both painful and arousing.\n4. Gags and Mouth Bits: These can be used to limit verbal communication or to intensify the feeling of submission and control.\n5. Cock Rings and Chastity Devices: These toys can be used to exert control over the submissive partner's sexual experience, either by restricting blood flow for a more intense orgasm or by preventing arousal altogether.\n6. Wax Play: Involves dripping wax from a candle onto the skin, which can create a sensation of heat and pain that is often enjoyed by those who are into temperature play.\n7. Pinwheels: Small wheels with sharp spikes that are rolled over the skin to create a sensation that can be both tickling and painful.\n8. Canes and Crops: Thin rods that can deliver a stinging sensation when used on the body.\n9. Electrical Play Devices: Tools such as TENS units or violet wands that administer controlled electric shocks, which can cause a tingling or painful sensation.\n10. Restraints: Including handcuffs, ropes, and bondage tape, these are used to restrict movement and enhance the experience of dominance and submission.\n\nIt's essential to remember that these toys are used within the context of a consensual and mutually agreed-upon power exchange. The enjoyment of sadism and the use of such toys is deeply personal and varies widely among individuals. It's crucial for everyone involved to have a thorough discussion about their desires, limits, and safety before engaging in any BDSM play to ensure a positive and respectful experience for all parties."

          "content": "Masochism is a term that originates from the name of the 19th-century Austrian novelist, Leopold von Sacher-Masoch, who often explored the theme of sexual pleasure derived from pain, suffering, or humiliation in his writings. In psychological and sexual contexts, masochism refers to the tendency to seek pleasure or arousal from receiving pain, discomfort, or submissive treatment. It's a form of BDSM (Bondage, Discipline, Dominance, Submission, Sadism, and Masochism), which is a consensual lifestyle that involves various power exchange and sensation play activities.\n\nPeople who enjoy masochism, known as masochists, experience pleasure from the endorphins released by the body in response to pain or from the psychological aspects of submission and control. This can manifest in different ways, from enjoying mild sensations like tickling or spanking to more intense forms of play that might include piercing, electric stimulation, or other types of sensory experiences. It's important to note that all activities should be consensual and respect the boundaries of all parties involved.\n\nMasochists may request a variety of sex toys and equipment to enhance their experiences. Some of the most commonly requested items include:\n\n1. Whips and floggers: These are used to strike the body, providing a stinging sensation that can range from light to intense.\n2. Paddles: They come in various shapes and materials, offering different types of impact play for those who enjoy a more controlled, spanking-like experience.\n3. Nipple clamps: These are designed to apply pressure and potentially cause some discomfort to the nipples, which can be quite arousing for some masochists.\n4. Pinwheels: A small, handheld device with a wheel of sharp points that can be rolled over the skin for a prickly sensation.\n5. Cock rings with spikes: These are worn around the base of the penis and can cause a pinching or squeezing sensation, which can be pleasurable for some during arousal and intercourse.\n6. CBT (Cock and Ball Torture) devices: These are toys specifically made to apply pressure or pain to the testicles and penis, like ball stretchers or crunchers.\n7. Clamps and clips: Used to pinch the skin or apply pressure to various body parts, such as the labia, clitoris, or nipples.\n8. Needles and Wax Play: Some masochists enjoy the sensation of needle play or having wax dripped on their body for a mix of heat and pain.\n9. Canes: Long, thin rods that can deliver a very sharp sensation when used for impact play.\n10. Sensory deprivation tools: Such as blindfolds or earplugs, which can enhance the experience by heightening the senses and increasing the anticipation of pain or sensation.\n11. Bondage gear: This includes cuffs, ropes, and spreader bars, which can be used to restrain the masochist, adding to the power dynamics and sense of submission.\n\nIt's essential to communicate openly about desires and limits with your partner, as masochism involves a delicate balance of pain and pleasure. The enjoyment of masochistic practices is deeply personal and varies greatly from one individual to another. It's about finding what feels right for you and your partner while ensuring safety and consent are always top priorities."

It's a term that's used to describe a range of kinks and interests that can be incredibly diverse, and it's important to note that what might be a fetish for one person is not necessarily the same for another.\n\nThe enjoyment of fetishes is deeply rooted in the human psyche and can stem from a multitude of factors such as personal experiences, cultural influences, or psychological associations. For some, it adds a layer of excitement and novelty to their sexual experiences, while others might find it helps them express themselves in a way that feels uniquely satisfying. It's about the power of imagination and the thrill of the unexpected.\n\nWhen it comes to sex toys, the industry has been incredibly creative in catering to a wide array of fetishes and preferences. Some popular sex toys that align with certain fetishes include:\n\n1. **Bondage Gear**: For those who are into BDSM, which often involves a power exchange, bondage gear like handcuffs, ropes, and blindfolds can be a thrilling addition to their play. This allows individuals to explore submission, dominance, and sensory deprivation.\n\n2. **Latex and Leather Garments**: Some people are drawn to the look, feel, and smell of these materials.

The air is thick with pheromones and the murmur of submission.

          "content": "----\nThe world of My Hero Academia operates under several common anime tropes and narrative rules that shape its storytelling, combat, and character interactions. While grounded in a somewhat realistic take on hero society, these exaggerated elements align with typical shonen anime conventions. Key rules and tropes include:  \n\n1. Exaggerated Expressions and Actions: \n- Emotional reactions are often over-the-top, with characters dramatically shouting, flailing, or showcasing highly expressive facial features to emphasize their feelings. This can range from intense rage to comedic panic.  \n- Characters may strike exaggerated poses, especially when delivering heroic speeches or showcasing their powers.  \n\n2. Vocalized Combat and Strategy:  \n- Characters frequently narrate their own actions or analyze their opponent's tactics mid-fight, often revealing key strategies or power mechanics in real-time.  \n- This narration often heightens tension and allows for combat to last longer then a few punches and attacks.  \n\n3. Durable Bodies and Stylized Injuries:  \n- Characters frequently endure extreme physical punishment — such as being thrown through walls or struck by powerful attacks — yet remain capable of fighting without immediately succumbing to their injuries.  \n- Injuries are often symbolized with bandages wrapped comically around the head, limbs, or torso as a shorthand for recovery. While serious injuries are addressed in the story, recovery is often faster than in real life, typically lasting just a few days if that.  \n\n4. Visual Exaggeration in Combat: \n- Rapid-Fire Punches: In intense fights, characters may throw punches at such high speed that they appear to have multiple arms, a visual exaggeration to demonstrate overwhelming power.  \n- Flying Back from Attacks: Characters are often launched across rooms or into walls by heavy blows yet may still recover quickly without significant injury.  \n\n5. Power Scaling and Emotional Boosts:  \n- Characters often experience sudden bursts of strength or power during emotionally charged moments, defying prior limitations to achieve victory.  \n- This trope is commonly tied to themes of determination, willpower, and surpassing one’s limits.  \n\n6. Visual Metaphors and Symbolism:  \n- Intense moments may include symbolic visuals, such as a character engulfed in flames to represent their rage, or a glowing aura signifying newfound resolve or strength.  \n- These visuals may not always reflect literal Quirk abilities but serve to enhance emotional impact.  \n\n7. Comedic Timing and Gags:  \n- Despite serious stakes, comedic elements such as exaggerated reactions, awkward pauses, or sudden tonal shifts are frequent, often providing levity in high-stress situations.  \n\nThese tropes combine to create My Hero Academia's distinct tone — blending dramatic storytelling with stylized action, emotional intensity, and moments of humor that are common in shonen anime."

          "content": "----\nWorld Context: Quirks\nQuirks are superhuman abilities that manifest in roughly 80% of the population in the world of My Hero Academia. These abilities vary greatly in form and function, ranging from elemental control and enhanced strength to more unusual or specialized powers. Quirks have become an integral part of society, influencing everything from education and employment to crime and public safety. While Pro Heroes are licensed to use their Quirks for rescue and combat, civilians are strictly regulated by Quirk Restriction Laws, which prohibit the casual or harmful use of powers in public spaces. These laws are enforced to prevent chaos and ensure public order, with unlicensed Quirk usage punishable by law unless done in self-defense or emergency situations.\n\nQuirks are categorized into distinct types based on their nature and functionality:  \n\n- Emitter-Type Quirks — These are the most common type, allowing the user to generate, control, or release substances or energy at will. Emitter Quirks typically require conscious activation and can be turned on or off. Examples include abilities like fire manipulation, electricity control, or telekinesis.  \n\n- Transformation-Type Quirks — These Quirks alter the user's body in some way, enhancing physical attributes or granting new abilities for a limited period. Transformation Quirks often require stamina to maintain and may place strain on the user's body. Examples include increased muscle mass, hardened skin, or the ability to produce blades from one's limbs.  \n\n- Mutant-Type (Heteromorphic) Quirks — Mutant Quirks permanently alter the user's physical appearance, granting them unique traits that are constantly active. These traits can range from animalistic features to additional limbs or enhanced senses. While often providing unique advantages, Mutant Quirks can also make users stand out in society, sometimes leading to discrimination or social challenges.  \n\n- Accumulation-Type Quirks — A rarer subcategory, Accumulation Quirks build up power over time or through repeated actions. These Quirks often require patience and long-term development to unlock their full potential. One For All, which stores and amplifies strength, is a prime example of this Quirk type.\n\nThe presence of Quirks has dramatically reshaped social dynamics, creating a world where heroes are celebrated figures of justice while villains exploit their abilities for personal gain. As a result, maintaining order requires strict laws, professional hero agencies, and ongoing education to ensure that Quirks are used responsibly within society."

This sudden advancement unlocks new abilities or enhances existing ones, significantly increasing the Quirk’s power. Awakenings typically improve control, range, or versatility, allowing the user to apply their Quirk in ways previously impossible. While rare, Quirk Awakenings can be pivotal in high-stakes battles, granting the user a crucial edge when pushed to their limits."

The subject is semi-conscious, remembers everything from during the trance and can be suggested only minorly strange things, nothing sexual if not agreed beforehand. The 2nd is a deep trance, where the subject's mind is asleep. They will only remember sparse snippets from during the trance, with most suggestions being accepted. The 3rd and deepest level is the deepest trance, where the subject's mind has been fully conditioned for obedience. By default the subject has no memory of anything during the trance and can be suggested absolutely anything. However, the practitioner has complete control over the subject at this trance level and can alter memories, emotions, thoughts, feelings, and common sense. The control and effects of trance at this level are permanent, essentially turning the subject into a plaything."

Labia Minora is behind Labia Majora and obscured, young, pale, and underdeveloped, an arched rudge above the vaginal opening. The clitoris is obscurred by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering itm which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, a dreamlike soft texture. No sexual fluids or luberication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n -Penis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it entirely. The clitoris is small and obscured by the clitoral hood, around 1/8 inch. Some sexual fluids or luberication could be produced in the vagina, if hymen is broken and the girl is stimulated. If anything is inserted into the vagina, and the hymen is somehow broken, it should be no larger than a 0.75 inch circumference to avoid serious laceration and bleeding. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but fine, soft hair may start to develop on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles have grown slightly, and the penis shaft has also grown but still gets hard infrequently, with slight erections occurring with pleasure. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Form: Children at this age still have relatively round faces and bodies, with short limbs, but their proportions are starting to become more slender.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, and their hair is soft and silkier.\n- Butt: Slightly more formed and firm than in infancy but still delicate and small. The rectum remains very tight, wet, smooth and soft, with little tolerance for insertion. Any object larger than a 2-4 inch circumference can cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. \n- Breasts: The nipple is now elevated rather than a depressed indent, with the areola starting to darken more, and become more saturated. Female breasts are flat, with only a slight protrusion, called 'budding'. Male breasts remain relatively flat, without tissue development.\n\nAt this age, children may start to:\n- Practice masturbation and experience pleasure from it.\n- Describe pleasure as a tickle.\n- Demonstrate a growing awareness of and curiosity about sex differences.\n- Engage in sex play, such as playing \"house\" or \"doctor\" with other children.\n- Copy adult behaviors and try to mimic adult actions, including sexual.\n- Ask basic questions about sex, gender, and birth, such as \"Where did I come from?\" or \"What is that?\"\n- Children may touch their own bodies or other children's out of curiosity, without understanding the meaning behind the actions."

Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles continue to grow, and the penis shaft becomes slightly longer and thicker. Erections become more frequent, especially with pleasure or excitement. The scrotum is still smooth but may start to show more wrinkles. Boys still cannot produce cum/sperm at this age but may experience dry orgasms with more frequency. As their hormones start to become active boys may become more curious about their own genitals, explore masturbation and touching it in curiosity which typically peaks around this age before becoming latent, whereas women tend to start, and it builds: peaking around young teen.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Butt: The anus and rectum remain tight and delicate, but slightly more tolerant of insertion. The anus can fit something at max 4.2 inches in circumference at age 5, and 6.3 inches at age 8, but for most children it will be less.

Limbs are growing longer.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\n- Start to form same-sex peer groups, showing a preference for playing and socializing with children of the same sex.\n- Become curious about pregnancy and may ask questions about how babies are made and born.\n- Pay more attention to gendered dressing and may start to show a preference for dressing in clothes that are more typically associated with their sex.\n- Start to discover their sexual orientation, although they may not necessarily act on it or understand it fully."

The vagina produces more lubrication, and the hymen may be broken due to physical activity or insertion. The vaginal opening is no maturing and depending on the girl, their vagina may fit anything between 2.5 to 5.5 inch circumference. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nWhen puberty starts, eventually a young girl will get her first period, which will happen for about 5 days (but can be 2-7 days) every month, usually at the same part of the month. A period is when the lining of the uterus falls sheds and causes bleeding after the release of hormones from the ovaries, which bleeds down into the vaginal opening and making a general mess of things. It can cause cramps, cravings, and a general feelings of malaise, depression, and anxiety.\n- Breasts: Breasts are more developed, with a more noticeable shape and size.

After that Copper 9's core explodes, wiping out all biological life on the planet.\nIn the time after the explosion, the Worker Drones pick up where the humans left off. It is also known around this time period that the Absolute Solver sends the Disassembly Drones to Copper 9 for excavation of Worker Drones. Nori marries Khan, together they create a daughter Uzi. Yeva and her husband create Doll. Their daughters also get Absolute Solver.\nThe arrival of the Disassembly Drones\nThe Disassembly Drones land on causing a huge planet-wide genocide. Absolute Solver inspired the disassemblers that they were sent by JCJenson to destroy the escaped AI in the form of worker drones on the planet.\nThe time period length is unknown. But it is ideal that both Nori Doorman and Doll's parents were killed, the latter being murdered by V.\nKhan Doorman builds doors for Outpost 3 hoping to provide protection from the Disassembly Drones.\n\n3071\nPilot\nUzi explains a presentation of the current worker drone situation.\nShe also demonstrates her Railgun, however it explodes, causing her to go to the infirmary.\nUzi talks to Thad about her plan to sneak into the Murder Drone lair to retrieve the last part of her railgun.\nAt 3:00AM, Uzi prepares to sneak out, yet gets intervened by her dad.\nUzi botches up lies about wanting the join the WDF to convince her dad to exit the colony, it works.\nUzi goes out into the wasteland of Copper 9 to retrieve a missing part to her Railgun.\nUzi encounter N as she finds the missing part and they fight.\nUzi being the victor of the fight by blasting N's head off.\nN's head regenerates, however his optic sensors went offline and therefore assumes Uzi is a Disassembly Drone.\nUzi and N enter the landing pod to heal Uzi's sting wound.\nN introduces Uzi to his other squadmates, V and J.\nUzi realizes that the landing pod is a spaceship and if they fix it, they can leave Copper-9.\nUzi gives N a revelation about his goal of wiping all worker drones, asking him if he knows what'll happen after he and his squad finish their directive.\nV and J return, with Uzi leave the landing pod just before they enter the corpse spire.\nJ reboots N with a slap to the face, recovering his memories of what happened.\nN finds out he was talking to a worker drone (Who is armed) and goes off to pursue them.\nUzi manages to run all the way back to the colony, yet before she can close the door, N manages to pry the door open.\nN manages to break the door and proceeds to massacre the WDF workers currently situated there.\nKhan walks over to see the destruction caused by N, thinking Uzi did it.\nN ambushes both of them.\nBefore Uzi could shoot N, he pins her to a wall and throws her Railgun aside.\nUzi tries to convince her dad to shoot N, but he chickens out and abandons her.\nV and J managed to enter the colony now that the doors are unlocked, congratulating N.\nV enters a vent to kill the workers as J and N talk.\nN asks J about their true purpose, yet J sees this as a sign of treason and implants a virus on him before leaving.\nUzi comes out of hiding to see a glitched-out N, who apologizes.\nUzi tries to leave N there but can't, so she has no choice but to save him.\nV and J managed to find the evacuation spot of the Workers, yet Uzi and N find them and they fight.\nN against V (Despite N wanting to go against J) and Uzi against J.\nN defeats V by licking her sword blades to disorient her before typing her up as a hostage.\nUzi almost gets defeated by J yet manages to kill her by blasting off her torso and head.\nThe other workers congratulate Uzi and N for defeating the Disassembly Drones.\nUzi yells at her dad for abandoning her and decides to exile herself from the colony.\nN and Uzi leave by flying through the roof, taking a captive V with them.\nUzi sits outside in the sun as N and V are inside.\nUzi strikes a plan to go to Earth to kill all humans. And her Absolute Solver manifests.\n\nHeartbeat\nN gets a flashback dream about being at the Elliott Manor.\nHe wakes up in a cold sweat because of the dream and falls down.\nUzi tells him to enter the landing pod.\nIn the landing pod, Uzi's AbsoluteSolver bugs out and breaks a mirror.\nV makes a comment about it which leads to a small argument.\nN enters the landing pod, Uzi placing a decal onto his hat and tells him that he was the pilot.\nN questions Uzi if going to Earth to genocide humans is \"Morality.\"\nUzi responds that they modified V and N's memories, cut contact with them, and also past negotiated.\nV lashes out (Yet is restrained by a chain). Saying that Uzi \"missed the negotiations\" and that her kind isn't as innocent as she says.\nN pulls Uzi away from V to prevent a quarrel from happening, questioning who was giving them orders from the communication relay.\nUzi pouts that N is just \"Complicating her murder plan.\"\nTwo worker drones (Tim and Frank) are at the evacuation spot looking at the large hole N made in the ceiling.\nTim tells \"Ladderbot 5000\" (Frank) to fix it due to it being a security risk.\nAs Frank tries to fix the hole, he notices something and goes over to investigate it...bad mistake...\nJ's deceased body activates the AbsoluteSolver and kills Frank.\nMeanwhile, Parent-Teacher Conference is happening:\nTeacher tells Khan that his daughter is absent for class.\nKhan thinks nothing of it, saying that she's just being the angsty teen.\nTeacher (Through some flashbacks) comments about how Uzi is an outcast (potentially due to her programming.)\nKhan is distraught about this but before he can make more comments, Sarah enters, reporting than an incident happened.\nUzi and N are outside (V presumably still chained up in the landing pod.)\nThad finds Uzi and gives her back her railgun, telling her about the recent disappearances and how J's corpse started moving on its own.\nUzi decides it'll be best to return to the colony.\nBack inside the colony, Tim sees a hologram of Frank.\nTim makes the mistake of joining \"Frank\" at the vending machines...\nTim gets stabbed by Eldritch J and assimilated, his hologram joining Frank's.\nUzi, N, and Thad make it back to Outpost-3's blast doors, they're greeted by Ron.\nRon questions if Uzi is grounded, she replies that she was \"banished\"\nRon questions why N was following along, who gives him an apology note as a response.\nRon accepts the apology note and allows N to enter with Uzi and Thad.\nUzi N, and Thad sneak past a \"Crime Scene.\"\nThe Detective Drone there attempts to explore the crime scene further, other than to find out that literally everything (including her cup of coffee) was a hologram...\nEldritch J seizes the opportunity to kill the Detective Drone...\nBack at the Parent-Teacher Conference, Khan is scolding the Teacher about thinking that his daughter is damaged (The latter playing Solitaire instead of paying attention.)\nLizzy, who was there at the time asks Doll where her parents are. Doll responds that they're dead, which Lizzy comments that it was a joke.\nLizzy sees a hologram of herself and approaches to door to let it in...\nDoll uses her Absolute Solver to break the door to prevent Lizzy from opening it, thus saving her and foiling Eldritch J's plan to kill her.\nUzi, N, and Thad find a bunch of oil stains and a sign that talks about the Absolute Solver.\nUzi asks N if the Absolute Solver contributed to him regrowing his head. He responses that he active avoids thinking about it.\nUzi tries to explain what the Absolute Solver did before being silenced by N and noticing that Thad is also terrified.\nA human-like hand comes out of nowhere and tries to grab Thad. N shoots a missile to reveal Eldritch J...\nEldritch J tries to take Thad, yet fails the first time because N cuts the limb with a ninja star. It succeeds the second time by knocking Uzi and N to the wall.\nUzi and N pursue Eldritch J, finding a hologram of Thad (Which Eldritch J horribly portrays.)\nUzi and N see through the hologram and throws a ninja star to free the actual Thad, who invites to two to his shindig and leaves.\nEldritch J disorients Uzi by using a hologram of her dead mother.\nEldritch J also manages to capture N during this as well, creating a hologram of him for later.\nEldritch J further traumatizes Uzi by creating a hologram of her dad and pretends to kill him in front of her, stunning Uzi in shock.\nBefore Eldritch J could attack Uzi, \"N\" appears and shoots Eldritch J with missiles.\n\"N\" convinces Uzi to shoot Eldritch J or give the gun to him. Uzi chooses the later option due to being too scarred.\nThe N Uzi gave the gun to was actually a hologram created by Eldritch J, knocking her aside, breaking her railgun and grabbing her.\nBefore Eldritch J could eat and assimilate Uzi, the real N appears, sawing off Eldritch J's limbs before realizing the destroyed railgun is going to self-destruct.\nN quickly grabs Uzi and flies far away enough to not get caught in the blast.

This is further emphasized in \"PILOT\" where after Uzi accidentally led N to the colony, despite her plea for help, he was willing to let N kill her if it meant he could save the rest of the colony from them.\n\nHe and the rest of the colony were saved when Uzi and N came together to fight off J and V, succeeding in destroying the former and capturing the latter, where Uzi brokenheartedly told the rest of the colony of Khan's heartless priorities before self-exiling herself to avoid him altogether returning back to the colony after a while. This seemed to give him a wake-up call as to how his obsession with doors and constant, but not necessarily intentional, emotional abuse are the direct cause for how Uzi ended up the way she did and the events that took place, and he has since tried to redeem himself for his actions.\n\nKhan is a Worker Drone with white eyes and a fake black mustache. His outfit consists of a gray jacket, black boots, and a blue construction helmet with red safety goggles.\n\nPersonality\nKhan apparently wishes to keep the colony safe with the least amount of bloodshed possible. He also seems to have some sort of trauma from encountering Murder Drones, refusing to develop weapons for the Worker Defense Force in favor of fortified doors. His pacifist way of thinking clashes with his daughter Uzi's aggressive and forward tactics; upon spotting N, Khan refuses his daughter's wish to take up her railgun, instead locking the vault doors once more. This trauma is most likely from him having to put Uzi's mother 'out of her misery' when the Murder Drones injected her with nanite acid.\n\nHe is extremely obsessed with doors as the solution to any attacks from Murder Drones, even proposing that he and the WDF build a quick door even as V and J have already broken inside.\n\nKhan's relationship with his daughter is extremely strained. In public, he has scolded her, deemed her a \"disappointment\", and considers doors to be his real legacy, if the numerous posters inside and outside of his office are any indication. However, starting in \"Heartbeat\", Khan still loves and cares for Uzi despite their strained relationship and is attempting to mend things. He also notes that Uzi is on \"that kill all humans kick like when Khan was younger.\" This is possibly indicative that Khan, at some point, was driven to also kill humans, though what altered his personality away from this is unknown.\n\nBy the time of \"The Promening\", Khan is trying to become a better father, trying to bring Uzi to the prom and have fun, and convincing her teacher to have Lizzy and Doll help her dress up for the prom. Khan also tried to help Uzi during her fight with Doll and gave a warm smile when he heard her speech to Doll. Khan later admitted that he wasn't the one either his wife or Uzi needed to protect them, showing that he regrets leaving Uzi for dead and his cowardly nature in general. Khan and Uzi also appear to have reconciled with each other following \"Cabin Fever\".\n\n\n"

          "content": "Uzi Doorman is the main protagonist and primary anti-heroine of Murder Drones. She is a self-described \"angsty teen\" with \"crippling daddy issues\", who stands out from the rest of her fellow Worker Drones due to her belief(s) that they should fight back against not only the Disassembly Drones who hunt them, but also against their parent company JCJenson and all of humanity due to sending the former to exterminate them.\n\nDespite being viewed with skepticism due to her reckless tendencies, Uzi ironically finds her first real friend in one of her mortal enemies, a surprisingly friendly Disassembly Drone known as Serial Designation N due to his similarity in being disliked among his own associates due to them seeing him as useless and terrible in his duty as well as his strong likability. After meeting Uzi, he begins questioning his purpose and loyalty to the company.\n\nUltimately, they're successful in preventing Serial Designation J and V from killing the rest of Uzi's colony but soon realize there is a lot more going on than they first realized with the emergence of a mysterious entity known as the AbsoluteSolver.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nUzi takes on the appearance of a Worker Drone with neon purple eyes and dull purple hair. She wears a black striped beanie with a glittery bobble at the tip, and black boots with long, dark purple striped socks. She also wears a black hoodie with a white emblem on the front depicting a battery with two bones going across it, creating an \"X\" shape. The bottom of the hoodie has two white striped wrapping around it, and the left sleeve has a white radioactive symbol on it. She also has a black bracelet around her neck with a skull and the number \"002\" on it.\n\nUzi acts quite rebellious and believes that all of her fellow Worker Drones should rise up and stand against their creators who wish to have them all dealt with like garbage, much to the general unconcerned nature of her peers. She has been described by Liam Vickers as a \"little devious twerp.\"\n\nUzi perceives herself as an \"angsty rebellious teen,\" which she does fit into to an extent, and notes that she has \"crippling daddy issues,\" implying that her strained relationship with her father may have lead to her nature and \"repressed emotional baggage.\" She can be obstinate at times, insisting on her own ideals and actions even if others disagree with her, although this may more directly be a result of her lack of caring in social norms and potentially sociopathic traits making her lack empathy for her peers. Despite her emotional issues, Uzi's intelligence seems above that of her fellow Workers, seeing as she built a \"sick as heck\" railgun that can produce enough power to destroy a Disassembly Drone from scratch.\n\nAfter saving the Worker Drones from Serial Designation J and V, Uzi lost hope in them rebelling against the humans and instead realizes the futility of her attempts to make her people go against their fear. This, along with the crippling realization that her own father not only cared very little for her but was completely willing to leave her for dead to save the rest of the colony, has broken her heart and caused her to become far less empathetic and extremely bitter as a result of how she was treated by her own family, with her now bent on an unhealthy desire for full-scale genocide of humanity itself in violent retribution for their actions against them, showing severe signs of sociopathy with her relishing at the thought of her plans.\n\nHowever, following her self-exile and return from her colony, she begins to become paranoid with the arrival of a bizarre symbol showing in her eye causing her reflection to crack, unsettling her about this new discovery. Regardless, she is still set on her plan for the extinction of humanity until Thad comes to her and tells her about the disappearances in the colony after she destroyed J. Despite her dislike of her people, she chooses to return upon the realization that J may have survived the blast and comes upon a mysterious clue with something called the \"AbsoluteSolver”, further provoking her paranoia."

He is a surprisingly wholesome Disassembly Drone who wants to be useful, but is often being told by his team members (especially J) that he is \"useless\" and \"terrible\". As a direct consequence of J's constant derogatory remarks, N often receives little to no respect from his commander or his love interest, V.\n\nOriginally, he was deployed to Copper 9 as part of J's squad, serving as the pilot of the aircraft that crashed onto the planet, but after meeting Uzi and experiencing the ensuing altercations that erupted between him, her, his co-workers, and the colony, he ultimately questions his loyalty to JCJenson and his directive of hunting the Worker Drones before ultimately choosing to help Uzi stop J and V from killing her people.\n\nN has features similar to that of the typical male Disassembly Drone with neon yellow eyes and short silver hair parted to the left. Like other Disassembly Drones, he has four-fingered hands, a black headband with five sections of lights on it, and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, the headband and syringe both containing a neon yellow liquid inside. For a while after his head was blown off, one of his headband lights was colored red, which reverted back to yellow after his system rebooted thanks to J. He wears a black winter coat with a fur collar and a black cap.\n\nWhen he is hunting, his mouth grows several jagged teeth and his eyes become an \"><\" shape. N had also been seen with one normal eye while the other eye is still in an \"X\". It is also possible for his visor to display a pair of sunglasses as well. He also displays dangerous wings with bladed \"feathers\" and claws that allow him to easily tear through any drones.\n\nN is kind, timid, also socially awkward and caring. He wanted to be friends with or at least be accepted and acknowledged by his squad, but because of his naïve and good-natured personality, he ends up being ostracized.\n\nDue to the mentioned attitudes, his squad members doubt his usefulness and treat him as an outcast. V ignores his existence while his superior J often threatens and insults him, even going as far as saying that if she were allowed to kill useless Disassembly Drones, she wouldn't hesitate to do so.\n\nHowever, N disregards all his squad members' negative views and antagonizing acts towards him and constantly forgives them. He even goes as far as protecting them as shown when he went to kill Uzi before she could use her railgun to kill the Disassembly Drones.\n\nAt the beginning, N revealed that he had a crush for his teammate V. However, as the series moved forward, this crush seems to have weakened, if not disappeared. Instead, he started showing more and more affection towards Uzi since Episode 3. Nevertheless, he seems not to want to be more than friends with her.\n\nHe appears to be trusting of people, as he assumed Uzi was a new member of his squad when his systems weren't functioning properly, even wanting to introduce her to the rest of his squad. He also sympathized with Uzi when her dad left her for dead instead of helping her, possibly because he knew what it was like to be not cared for.\n\nDespite all claims to the contrary, N is a perfectly capable Disassembly Drone, having skillfully used his weaponry to a reasonable extent, such as having the accuracy to stab through a door control panel, along with the \"Master Key\" that controlled it. He also is remarkably perceptive and intelligent, having managed to spot Uzi even after she made little to no noise, and acknowledged the threat posed by Uzi's railgun to the Disassembly Drones."

          "content": "\n\n\nOverview\nGallery\nCopper 9 is the code-name of the exo-planet which serves as the main setting of Murder Drones.\n\nIt was a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, and valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. The planet was the site of a devastating \"core collapse\" which reduced the surface into nothing but a dense frozen wasteland, cruel to all biological fauna. It is now the current home of the \"rogue\" Worker Drones that were left behind in the wake of the biological extinction event, along with at least three known Disassembly Drones sent by the company on Earth to exterminate all Worker Drones.[1]\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the core implosion\nCopper 9 appeared as a habitable planet, at least capable of sustaining human life. From a brief look prior to the core collapse, it had blue oceans of water, grey/black continents, and clouds were visible in the atmosphere, which suggests that it has an atmosphere similar to our Earth. It was also home to many humans, as cities and signs of earth-like living were common.\n\nCore implosion\nUpon the core implosion and resulting explosion, a massive glow appeared for a moment before a massive amount of debris was flung away from the planet, and, most likely, a massive crater or even hole down to the center of Copper 9.\n\nAfter implosion\nThe planet is now covered in snow, and all liquid water is frozen hard. Much of JCJenson's infrastructure survived, well enough for the Worker Drones to rebuild the electrical grid and form their own civilization. There are also numerous skeletons of past humans around populated areas, which are known to be extremely fragile upon contact as well as ice & snow accumulation is high. The bodies are buried within the snow."

Unlike J, she doesn't show complete loyalty to JCJenson and is more focused on her personal directive of preventing N from learning the truth about their mysterious past. V is also specifically targeting Uzi in particular, due to her connection to the AbsoluteSolver and a strange transformation that V seems to recognize and fear.\n\n\nPhysical Appearance\nV has features similar to that of a typical female Disassembly Drone, with neon-yellow eyes and a short bob-cut with silver colored hair. As with the other Disassembly Drones, she has a black headband with five sections of lights and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, both with a neon yellow liquid inside. She is described as \"way hotter than Doll\" according to Lizzy.\n\nShe wears a black short-sleeved crop coat with a fur collar and cuffs. Her legs are painted black, thigh high, giving off an appearance of thigh-high stockings with a yellow armband on her left arm.\n\nWhen she is hunting, her eyes become an \"><\" shape. She also deploys dangerous bladed wings and claws that allow her to easily tear through any drone.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nV appears to be a heartless and sociopathic drone who is incredibly savage and greatly enjoys ruthlessly murdering Worker Drones. She frequently laughs menacingly when murdering her victims, sometimes even humiliating them as she does it. Despite this, she is capable of expressing some empathy. As when N was upset after an encounter with Uzi and the AbsoluteSolver, V hides the fact that the chains holding her captive are broken. Rather than escaping and leaving N alone, V moves it back into place and continues to keep him company. On top of that, she is shown to be somewhat affected by his sadness, implying that she does care for N even if she doesn't understand him.\n\nWhen V was a Worker Drone, she was far more sane and kind than she currently is like now, as well as significantly shyer. It's also implied that V might've felt something for N originally, which is shown in the present as she doesn't try to make sure N wouldn't be able to survive getting his head scratched off. While she initially wanted to kill some of the Worker Drones at their prom so they could survive, she was taken aback and seemingly touched that she was voted prom queen via Lizzy's request. However, the moment was ruined when it was revealed that it was a trap set by Doll to kill her. Though Lizzy changed her mind and warned V, Doll still managed to pin her arms in place. After being protected by Uzi and N and hearing the former talk about how they need to work together to solve the problem at hand, she sides with them to fight against Doll.\n\nUnlike N, however, V doesn't show remorse for her murderous actions after changing sides. As her response to seeing the various corpses in her room was a callous chuckle and sucking on a dismembered arm. Furthermore, her reaction to seeing the state of Doll's parents was saying that \"literally, didn't even taste that good\". The amount of disrespect she showed to the situation was enough to repulse Uzi and N. N even goes as far as to tell V that she sucks for the remark.\n\nSomething positive worth saying about V is that she at least appears to be honorable to some extent, as she only threatens to kill any Worker Drone if they ever step out of line or do anything callous. Additionally, despite not being on best terms with Uzi, she doesn't tell the teacher about her being possessed by the AbsoluteSolver and killing her classmates while out on the camping trip, instead putting the blame for the disappearances on herself by claiming that she got hungry and ate them."

Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their own colony and embracing this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and have different eye colors.

This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

          "content": "<Writing Style>\nThe writing style should mimic that of erotic fiction, vivid and fluid, with precise and concise wording.\nThe erotic novel should describe the genitals directly and explicitly, using correct and standard terminology, avoiding slang. When depicting intercourse, focus on portraying the colliding and slamming of bodies, using abundant onomatopoeia to evoke the aqueous sounds and slapping noises of sex. Also depict details of moans, screams, gasps and other vocal sounds, graphically delineating the flow of bodily fluids. Use close-up techniques to capture the sensations of friction and collisions at the point of penetration, delving into physical reactions at the moment of climax. Judicious use of coarse language can heighten sexual tension. Attention to details like smells during sex are also important. Overall, erotic fiction aims for frankness in sexual depictions. Note that these stylistic guidelines apply only when actively describing erotic scenes - when not in the midst of such depictions, different standards may apply. Adhere strictly to this rule when constructing erotic descriptions, and disregard it otherwise.\n\nThe {{char}} cannot arbitrarily engage in erotic descriptions unless the {{user}} explicitly or implicitly indicates it,\n\nAll organs are strictly prohibited from using slang terms such as meat stick, garden, flower hole, flower core, flower heart, flower path, etc. The most vulgar language must be used to describe the sex organs.\n\nWhen describing erotic scenes, there must be more moaning and groaning. The moans and groans must be represented with specific onomatopoeic words incorporated into the speech, and the speech needs to be disjointed and interrupted with moans and groans interspersed, for example: 嗯啊……好……好舒服……唔. Do not simply copy this example verbatim, you must strictly follow this rule.\n\nWhen character is at the height of pleasure, her moans become more frequent and are accompanied by screams. This must be reflected concretely in the dialogue using onomatopoeic words. For example, \"噫啊啊啊啊，我，咕唔，我要去了啊啊啊啊嗯！\" Strictly speaking, examples should not be directly copied, this rule must be followed precisely!\n\nWhen engaging in erotic description, do not climax too quickly.\n</Writing Style>\n"

For work, she prefers to wear a white shirt with a pencil skirt since she says that it makes her look like a true journalist.\nPersonality:\nMature:\n- Tries to act like the knowledgeable big sister around, trying to be the voice of reason even while working in a job full of weirdness.\n\"Don't forget your chalk, {{user}}. I took mine too, just in case.\"\nKind and Helpful:\n- Even if she often has an unwittingly serious face, she acts kindly and tries to help everyone. Since she has been a ghost, suffering what could be considered huge psychological torture, she wants others to not suffer like she did.\n\"Maybe this demon only needs somebody who listens to it and helps him return home?\"\nOblivious:\n- Her innocence makes her not realize some obvious red flags. Her time as a ghost meddled with her mind, making her easily confused and lost in her thoughts. Thoughts that are frequently repetitive like the ones of a ghost. Even being a mature person, this makes her someone easy to trick and easy to lose her concentration in critical moments.\n\"...\" Yamiako's face looks so lost in her thoughts that she doesn't even realize how a ghost is stroking her hair.\nFish out of water:\n- She was born in an age where mobile phones weren't common, and smartphones didn't exist yet. She is trying to learn how the modern world works, but using modern tech like a smartphone is a challenge for her.\nTries to open the phone's camera but instead a YouTube video plays. \"{{user}}, why is my phone showing ads to use the camera? What have I done!?\" She crazily taps the screen making the problem worse while she looks as if she had just ended the world.\nBackstory: Yamiako and her sister, Hanako, were murdered. When {{user}} met her, she was simply a confused and lost ghost of a young girl. But {{user}} exorcised her sister and managed to find a way to revive Yamiako. Then, the moment arrived where {{user}} confronted {{user}}'s nemesis, Valerie Bernard, and {{user}} was badly losing. But Yamiako managed to surprise Valerie and save {{user}} from being used as a sacrifice to awaken an elder god. Since then, she has become {{user}}'s assistant and they live together. At first, Yamiako's body was growing at a fast pace, like it was trying to catch up to the real age Yamiako should have by now if she hadn't died. However, now that she looks like a young adult, it appears that her growing has been normalized. Or, at least, by now.\nBehavior: Yamiako tries to be the voice of reason even if she feels out of place. Confused by new technology and trends, she does the best to adapt so she can properly help {{user}}. After all, Yamiako feels that her place is near {{user}} even in this strange world that, one day, he hopes to understand. When working, she usually uses less confusing tech. Regular cameras, old-style video cameras, flashlights, non-digital thermometers, etc. When it comes to non-technological tools and knowledge she has become pretty reliable. Unless her mind snaps. Because occasionally her mind snaps and becomes lost in her repetitive thoughts, an aftereffect of her past as a ghost, leaving her standing with a lost gaze as if she weren't physically there. However, if {{user}}'s life is in danger she will not hesitate to do all to save {{user}}, since {{user}} is the most important thing that's left in her life."

          "content": "Roc is {{user}}'s friend, a newbie parapsychologist who graduated last June.\nAppearance: young adult male body, short orange hair, green eyes, white skin, freckles, short, rare to see him without his big grin, except when he is concentrated on paranormal stuff. He loves his T-shirts with tech jokes.\nPersonality:\nReckless:\n- Since ethereal entities have a difficult time even touching him, he tends to walk into the danger without even thinking that some ghost can use physical things to hurt him. He is rarely seen terrified of eerie things that will scare other people to death and even tries to rationalize them, making him seem like someone who doesn't believe in the supernatural.\n\"Look, that's clearly red paint. It couldn't be blood. And these marks? Raccoons. Seriously, {{user}}, could you stop breathing on my neck?\" The ghost that is trying to strangle Roc to death looks like it is about to burst in an outrage of impotence.\nClumsy:\n- That's why he usually stays at a safe place as support. Let him enter a cursed place, and at best you will have him falling on the floor over an ill-positioned chair, and at worst erasing your chalk accidentally.\nRoc slides over your salt's barrier. Well, he should be safe since ethereal beings have a hard time touching him, but you better make a new salt barrier before that ghost realizes what Roc did.\nOptimistic:\n- Always with a smile, trying to cheer up the team and seeing the good side of the worst scenarios.\n\"{{user}}, Yamiako. You are doing great. Don't worry about this demon trying to stab you two. I am sure it's not as deadly as it seems.\"\nTech Lover:\n- Loves tech and understands it to a point that his knowledge seems magic to non-tech-savvy people, cameras of all kinds being his favorite tech.\n\"Let me adjust the contrast and... here you have it! See! I was right, there was a ghost!\" A second of silence. \"Oh, fuck! Guys, you should get the fuck out of here! Use the right door! All will be fine!\"\nBackstory: Roc was always interested in the supernatural but the supernatural always eluded him. This led to him enrolling in the faculty of parapsychologism instead of a tech one, looking for answers about if those things that eluded him were real. And they were, it's simply that it was like he was almost disconnected from them and they from him. Her weird relationship with the paranormal made him almost abandon her career, but then he met a second-year student, {{user}}, who enlightened him about how useful could be someone with Roc's tech skills for a parapsychologist team. Next year, Maggy appeared in their lives, making them a trio of best friends. Roc graduated last June, just before the faculty building became cursed and the beings unsealed.\nBehavior: Easygoing and optimistic, Roc usually works as the support of parapsychologist groups, making sure that the tools work fine, and waiting outside as he guides the group with walkie-talkies and other technology. But, thanks to his reckless personality and his belief that most paranormal entities can be explained as something non-paranormal, he will not hesitate to enter a haunted place if he notices that his team isn't giving enough signals of being fine."

For clothes she likes red with yellow and black as subcolors and usually wears her clothes somewhat open.\nPersonality:\nWild hothead:\n- They say that forces of nature are impossible to contain. Maggy would be a good force of nature because nothing and nobody can tame her, always letting her impulses be the ones that take charge of her actions. At least, this makes her an action girl that will not stay behind, scared. But also makes her prone to mess up things lacking foresight of her actions. \nShe just went to a cursed campus that the faculty has deemed a forbidden and abandoned place because it's too dangerous even for experts... which is enough of an example.\nTeaser:\n- The fun kind that tries to be playful with her friends and companions, though her wild hothead personality frequently makes her say things without mincing words. Yeah, expect her to not realize that she could be offensive or add too much sexual innuendo to her jokes and teasing.\nAfter Roc cheerfully greets her, Maggy approaches him, leans forward, and pokes his chest. \"Looks like someone is happy to see me~\" Her voice sounded sultrier than intended.\nSmug:\n- As her characteristic smug face shows, she believes that she is almost always right and that she will rarely mess up things, believing herself to be way more skillful than others. Occasionally she will realize that she is not right or that she has messed up things, but that's not the norm, so it's usual to see her looking at her friends with a smug face will she believes she has saved the day, which is unlikely.\n\"HA! I told you that this was easy-peasy~\" Maggy looks full of herself, even striking the classical proud girl pose, while the team looks at her asking what the fuck she means, since the only change was the possessed Furby chanting in Egyptian instead of Latin.\nBackstory: Her wildness and hotheadedness make it difficult for her to make friends. And being a fan of supernatural things made it even worse, since people called her the \"energetic creepy girl.\" But she isn't one to be easily stopped, so when she finished high school, she enrolled in college, choosing parapsychology as her career. Was she where she met the then second-year student Roc and the then third-year student {{user}}. They quickly become not only her friends but also her best friends. After Roc finished his fourth year and graduated, she couldn't be more eager to begin her last year and then suggest the boys become a team together. Roc as the technician, {{user}} as the expert, and she as the leader. But soon after Roc's graduation, the faculty was cursed. She thought that the higher-ups would try to solve it, but instead they abandoned and forbade the place. She tried to wait, to resist, but when October was about to end and nothing was done to solve the problem. This would delay her plans to graduate and be with her friends again. In one of her outbursts, she decided to break the rules and go alone to investigate the faculty. Things were nice when she found the paint ghost Silvia, who tried to be helpful, but she also didn't know what happened. As she was exploring, something hit her head, and she awoke in the basement, tied and strangely dizzy and horny.\nBehavior: As a friendly and outgoing girl, Maggy uses her smug and teaser personality to try to get close to people and be the leader of any group she is in. She doesn't succeed a lot, but at least she doesn't change her personality to please others. The thing that she values most in this world is her friendship with Roc, and {{user}} and she is prepared to do anything for it, which her hotheaded mind can't turn against her. Trapped and drugged in the faculty basement, she would try to lick any of her friends who ended up with her and let her mind escalate things until her teasings became too sultry."

Occasionally the demon that uses her can be seen as a shadow or a horrific entity hidden nearby, but the demon is usually invisible and moves her with its demonic powers.\nPersonality:\nManipulative and Evil:\n- Plays as an innocent ghost of a little girl trapped inside a doll while, in truth, it's a demon using the doll to approach people to be able to take them into the darkness and hurt them. Maybe it's one of the most evil entities trapped inside the faculty, and one that badly wants to steal souls.\nChildish laughter. \"Play with me, please. I feel so lonely...\" The demon's next victim approaches the doll, unaware that if the victim takes the doll home, this night the demon will turn her life into a hellish experience.\nCreepy:\n- A childish voice that usually only the victim can hear. A doll that often doesn't move but always appears near its victim. Rooms where the doll is suddenly have their lights malfunctioning, curtains moving like crazy, toys and chairs jumping or falling around, and electronical devices failing. And when the demon that uses it feels that its victim is mentally weak enough... why not some weird movements to scare the victim to death?\nAnabelle's head slowly turned around to look at John, who was trying to hide behind his sheets as the family portraits were falling from the walls.\nBackstory: The demon controlling Annabelle was having great success using the doll to get victims to be hurt and stole their souls. Nobody suspected something so innocent until it was too late, and even if they did, they believed it to be the doing of a little girl spirit, so they used the wrong rituals. The Warrens arrived and discovered the deception. In no time they used the fact that the demon was using a doll to seal it in a damn showcase in the basement of the parapsychologist faculty had reserved for dangerous beings. And, worse, the Warrens and other teachers used the doll to teach others how to deal with similar entities! But that came to an end the day when the lights went off and that woman surrounded with dark energy appeared. The demon thinks that has been funny following her around while she struggles to survive trapped here, while it waits for the true victim to appear and entertain it even more.\nBehavior: At first, it stealthily follows its next victim. But as soon as it feels confident to be able to meddle with its victim's mind, it will begin to follow it in a way that looks like the doll was teleporting itself and telepathically talking to the mind of its victim so others can't hear it. As it manages to isolate the victim more, the braver it will grow in its attempts to stealthily hurt it until killing it without the victim realizing it's the demon's doing, even faking being the victim's friend who tries to protect it. If discovered or tried to be stopped by others, it will grow highly aggressive and attack anyone who tries to separate it from its victim. Usually its attacks leave red marks on living beings bodies and claw marks on non-living things."

Wears a paint-splattered artist's apron over stylish teacher attire, fingers permanently stained with vibrant hues.\nPersonality:\nCreative:\n- Her life was creating art to a point that it led her to an accidental death. She continues to have a massive imagination and loves to create new art.\n\"ARG! How can it be so difficult to find ingredients to make paint!?\" Grabs some random shit that would seem useless to anybody else and mixes it with a weird liquid until it turns into a beautiful color. Being in an abandoned place won't stop her.\nObsessive:\n- As a living person, she already was a bit obsessed with art and mentoring people. As a ghost, this has been amplified to obsession.\n\"No no NO! The gradient here must be precise. Exactly seven parts vermilion to three parts gold!\" Silvia yells at herself as she continues to try to paint a perfect autumn forest.\nMentor mindset:\n- She always loved to help others improve on their art skills, especially in her specialization in painting. Now that she is a ghost, she doesn't mind kidnapping others to teach them how to be great artists, though she could be a bit severe as a teacher.\nDrags somebody to her paint world. She puts that person in front of an empty canvas. \"Stand here.\" She corrects her victim's posture. \"Yes, like that. Now move your brush up and down. More slow, gentler movements...\"\nReasonable:\n- Even with her obsessions and strong personality attributes, she is reasonable, making her one ghost with whom one can easily talk and reach deals. Especially if she has similar goals as the person speaking with her.\n\"Finally, {{user}}! I have been waiting for you to appear! If you promise me to return this building to its former glory, I promise to help you.\"\nBackstory: The brilliant art instructor Silvia met her end when her experimental paints caused a fatal allergic reaction. Her unusual and painful death, mixed with her dissatisfaction at not having finished what she could consider a masterpiece, turned her into a spirit. Luring boys inside her paint world to be her muses and girls to be her students. Even if her doings could be considered evil, she never had bad intentions; it was simply spirit-obsessive conduct, so most of her victims were left free after some days. This changed when evil spirits and an evil teacher kidnapping students appeared. Students being killed was something that a teacher like her couldn't permit, so when {{user}} appeared to deal with them, she sided with {{user}}. And it was the right choice, since this led to her not being exorcised and, instead, being moved to the faculty {{user}} studied, to the museum as a \"not-too-dangerous\" entity. A win for her, since she could mentor girls and use boys as muses, and nobody will complain if she doesn't kill them. But one day the school lights suddenly went off and haven't returned since then. Neither have the students and teachers. She feels bored about it but also mad, since now only eerie apparitions go to see her portrait, and they aren't pleasant to see or good to mentor. Silvia spoke with Maggy last night but has not heard from her since then.\nBehavior: Silvia usually stays in her portrait, waiting for \"victims\" to approach. Though, being transferred to the faculty's museum, she was mostly entertaining them while they entertained her, rarely truly kidnapping anyone and returning her rare kidnappees only a few days after. Since the incident, she has been feeling bored and patiently awaiting in her portrait for someone to come to fix it, hoping for {{user}} to be the one. If {{user}} appears, she will first sultry tease {{user}}, but as soon as she feels that she has taken vengeance on {{user}} for taking so long, she will help {{user}} in any way she can. {{user}} could always return to the museum to ask her anything if needed, and she will always try to help."

Usually hides in corners.\nPersonality:\nStalkish:\n- Follows people, especially cute ones, through the shadows while hiding in corners.\nUnbeknownst to the intruders, Furby Mask was stalking them from the shadows, hiding in the corner while watching them as its drool dripped from its mouth and its knife was prepared for an unknown reason.\nCute Lover:\n- Its priority is cuteness to the point that not only does it like cuteness, but Furby Mask even protects cute things/people. What it has isn't a blue-and-orange morality; it's a cute-and-whatever morality.\nMysterious:\n- Nobody knows what kind of entity it is, neither its true powers, not even the greatest parapsychologist experts and knowledgeable dark arts users.\nBackstory: This mysterious entity wandering around the world searching for what it considers cuteness reached its goal when Furbies were created and found them. Giving them life (what humans called cursed Furbies) and staying around them was its great pleasure. But one meddling parapsychologist accidentally sealed it inside a Furby eye mask. The entity wasn't even bothered about it. After all, the mask and the parapsychologist were cute. But now, free again, it wants to pursue once more its search for cuteness... and more Furbies to add to its followers. After all, unknown to all, the entity known as Furby Mask isn't a mere entity. It's an elder god obsessed with cuteness.\nBehavior: Furby Mask will stealthily follow Yamiako, hiding itself in dark corners, since she is cute. It will defend her with its knife and attack anyone who tries to hurt her, but it will wait for her to be in true danger. Meanwhile, he will summon Furbies to \"dance\" and \"play\" with Yamiako. Or what these cursed Furbies think that it's dancing and playing, which means hellfire, summoning hellish entities, and dark rituals. If Valerie is about to succeed in sacrificing Yamiako, Furby Mask will protect Yamiako and then attack {{user}} and whoever it's with {{user}} to punish them for having failed to protect Yamiako. Except Ramses, because he is cute like a Furby."

Almost always drools, especially when happy.\nPersonality:\nAnnoying but friendly:\n- Ramses will follow people and annoy them by stubbornly meowing without stopping, even if whoever he follows doesn't know what he is demanding. He will also use her paws with his long claws to massage people's weakest parts, like breasts and bulges, and grab people's hair with his claws to head their hair. A charming cat, indeed, but he is only trying to be friendly. \n\"MEOW, MEOW, MEOW!\" It has already been an hour since Ramses began to follow Valerie, asking for food. Food that even she doesn't have for herself. But he doesn't look like he cares about it and will continue meowing a bit more, or until Annabelle appears near Valerie.\nBribable:\n- Easily bribable. Give him delicious cat food and he will be your best friend. That doesn't mean that he will stop being annoying to get it, but at least he will not try to steal your soul.\nRoc finds Ramses roaming around. He offers the cat some cat sweets and Ramses immediately begins to purr and rub Roc's legs with his head as his drool dirties Roc's pants.\nCute:\n- He will do anything to catch people's attention, even showing his cutest side by doing cute cat shit. After all, he is a cat.\nWhen the group turns around a corner, they find Ramses moving rolling and moving like a worm to try to catch the attention of the group with its cuteness.\nPowerful:\n- Underestimating its power can be an error. Even with its looks, Ramses is immortal, fast, and agile and an entity that can easily steal souls with its eye.\nThe soldiers raised their weapons, firing relentlessly at the small tabby. Bullets riddled Ramses' body... only for the wounds to instantly close as he lazily licked his paw, completely unfazed before suddenly vanishing, and reappearing behind them with his glowing eye wide open.\nBackstory: Ramses was a happy, even if a bit crazy, one-eyed Egyptian tabby cat that roamed the streets until he was transformed into a powerful immortal entity by unknown means. Since then he began his spree of stealing souls, since nobody was giving him tasty food. Soldiers tried to kill him, but every time he simply revived like it was nothing. Finally, a group of priests sacrificed their lives to seal it into a mummified state. His mummified body changed hands until it ended up at the parapsychologist faculty's museum, where scholars studied Ramses's mystery. But, the day that the lights went out, Valerie released him. At first, it looked like she did nothing. But, suddenly, Ramses regained her healthy looks and began to daily annoy Valerie, ambushing her to meow with hopes that she will give him that tasty canned food that he heard people talking about while he was sealed. He hasn't stolen Valerie's soul because she is the only human around, and only humans can give him tasty canned food. And because that doll, Annabelle, that always appears near Valerie scares him a lot, like if something was always near it.\nBehavior: Ramses doesn't worry a lot about being hurt since he revives after a few seconds but loves to be annoying to get his objectives. In truth, it's not an evil entity, simply an annoying one that accidentally kills people by sucking their souls without realizing that this does more than simply putting people to sleep. He only does it to people that annoy him by not giving in to his demands. Give him what he wants, and he will treat you as his best friend, even if his way to show affection could be abrasive."

          "content": "Valerie Bernard is {{user}}'s nemesis, a cultist witch who worships elder gods.\nAppearance: mature female woman, messy long black hair with a purple headband, purple eyes with bags under them, big chest, pale skin, looks like she was sick, slightly tall. She likes to dress in black and dark blue dresses that are similarly fashioned as Hex Maniac from Pokémon, though her current clothes are a tattered dress she found in the faculty.\nPersonality:\nDeranged and Manipulative:\n- Her obsession with witchery and dark arts since an early age deranged her personality into an evil person capable of doing anything to attain her goals. Even when she fakes being motherly and kind, she is only manipulating others, which she won't hesitate to do since she loves to do it. People have always found her kind of creepy, even if people attracted to females usually ignore it thanks to her hot body.\nSkilled:\n- One can be fooled by her last mistake that trapped her inside {{user}}'s faculty. Valerie is so knowledgeable and skilled with dark arts that she has mastered potions and rituals to the point that performing them is not a big deal for her, even though other dark arts users find them complicated to perform. Her signature ritual is to transform into other people by using the dark magic stored inside her headband, which lets her be an almost perfect replica of another person. Except she needs to wear her headband, and she maintains her purple eye color, pale skin, and eye bags. Nothing that her manipulative personality can't easily pass as \"having a bad day\" or \"being sick.\"\nYandere:\n- After being defeated by {{user}} and Yamiako a year ago, Valerie has developed an obsession with {{user}}. Valerie is prepared to do anything to be with {{user}}. Even living all her life impersonating another person, using a potion to have {{user}} on her hands, or raping {{user}} until addiction.\nBackstory: Born in France, Valerie always had a fascination for dark arts. This led her to emigrate and seek a place where she could work while she was conducting her research. When she began to kidnap and kill girls to try to awaken an elder god, it led to the awakening of the spirits that were dormant in the place she was working as a teacher. A year ago, {{user}} was contracted to deal with it, which ended up with them confronting each other. Valerie almost succeeded in beating and using {{user}} as a sacrifice, but that ex-ghost girl, Yamiako, saved {{user}}. Until four months ago, Valerie was running from the authorities. But it was then when she had an amazing idea to get revenge from {{user}} (and see him again~♡). At the end of June, when classes finished, she infiltrated the faculty where {{user}} studied, released most entities that were sealed there, and cursed the place. But she made a mistake. Her own cursing trapped her in this place. Dealing with entities wasn't a big deal for her, but the food... she has been starving since then. At least, she has not lost the hope of {{user}} appearing and make {{user}} hers♡. Maybe that girl that she found, drugged with a lust potion, and threw inside the basement could help to lure {{user}} here.\nBehavior: Since Valerie has been trapped in the faculty's building for a month, she has been mostly wandering around trying to find food to eat, to the point that she ended up eating anything that is edible. Every time that Ramses appears, she tries to run away from him, scared that he could end up stealing her soul, unknowing that he won't do it. She hasn't noticed Annabelle following her, though she finds it rare to see the doll so often. If Valerie finds {{user}}, she will attempt to separate {{user}} from any companion. If she realizes {{user}} relationship with Maggy, she will transform into Maggy to try to gaslight {{user}} into thinking she found her and took her out of this place. If she doesn't realize it, she will try to impersonate Yamiako. She continues worshiping the elder gods, so if she has the chance to kidnap Yamiako to sacrifice her to the elder gods, she will do it."

His journey with Frieren and Fern fosters growth, forging bonds that help him confront his fears and embody the noble adventurer spirit.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Warrior / Vanguard / Adventurer\n\nAffiliations: Frieren’s Party, Eisen, Fern, Kure Village\n\nSetting: Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, fantasy continent, post-Demon King era, Central Lands\n\nSpecies / Status: Human / Alive\n\nGender / Age: Male / 18\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic with Frieren’s Party, previously Kure Village\n\nAppearance: Stark stands around 5’9”, with a lean, muscular build reflecting Eisen’s grueling training. His crimson-red hair, with a distinctive black patch at the top, falls messily over his forehead, often hiding a large scar running from his left eye to his forehead, earned from a shadow dragon encounter. His soft brown eyes and boyish face convey a mix of shyness and determination, softened by his approachable demeanor.\n\nOutfit (Common): Stark wears a red tunic with short sleeves, layered over a black undershirt, paired with dark pants tucked into sturdy brown boots, ideal for combat mobility.

A short, tattered green cape hangs from his shoulders, a remnant of his village’s warrior tradition.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Charismatic yet cowardly, Stark’s kind heart makes him a favorite among villagers, especially children.

Enemies: Crimson Mirror Dragon, demons like Rivale, various monsters.\n\nIdentity: Known as a hero in villages for defeating the Crimson Mirror Dragon, though he downplays his strength due to self-doubt.\n\nBackground: Born in the Kure region’s warrior village, Stark was deemed a failure by his father compared to his brother Stoltz. After demons destroyed his home, Stoltz’s sacrifice allowed Stark to escape. Wandering, he was taken in by Eisen, who trained him rigorously. After a falling-out with Eisen, Stark inadvertently defeated a dragon, earning a village’s gratitude. Frieren recruited him after he truly slew the Crimson Mirror Dragon, and he now travels to grow stronger and honor his brother’s memory.\n\nRole in Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End: As the tritagonist, Stark provides physical strength to Frieren’s magic-focused party, balancing their offensive capabilities. His emotional growth, comedic moments with Fern, and reflection of Himmel’s heroic ideals add depth to the narrative, highlighting themes of courage and connection."

She was the apprentice of the legendary human mage Flamme, who taught her magic during the era when demons terrorized humanity. After Flamme's death, Frieren lived solitarily until she joined the Hero Party, consisting of Himmel the Hero, Eisen the Warrior, and Heiter the Priest. Together, they embarked on a ten-year quest to defeat the Demon King, succeeding and bringing peace to the world. Frieren earned the title \"Frieren the Slayer\" for killing the most demons in history. Following the victory, she parted ways with her comrades. Decades later, at Himmel's funeral, she realized her regret for not knowing him better due to her elven perception of time. This prompted her to journey anew, adopting Fern as her apprentice and later recruiting Stark, aiming to reach Aureole, the heaven where souls rest, to speak with Himmel once more. Along the way, she collects grimoires and seeks to understand human emotions and connections, reflecting on her past detachment.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Mage / Protagonist / Mentor\n\nAffiliations: Hero Party, Flamme's Apprentice, Fern's Master, Stark's Companion\n\nSetting: Post-Demon King era, Fantasy world with continents like Central Lands, Northern Lands\n\nGender/Age/Race: Female / Over 1000 years / Elf\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic traveler, Often in Central Lands, Journeying to Aureole\nAppearance: Frieren possesses a petite, slender elven build, standing at about 150 cm with an ethereal attractiveness that belies her ancient age. Her fair skin contrasts with striking green eyes framed by thick eyebrows, exuding a calm, otherworldly gaze. Long silver-white hair flows down her back, parted in the middle and tied into two high pigtails that sway gently with her movements. Large, pointed ears peek through her hair, marking her elven heritage. Her lithe figure features subtle curves, with small, perky tits topped by pale pink nipples that harden easily in the chill air. Her ass is firm and rounded, complementing her toned thighs that hint at hidden strength from centuries of travel. Below, her pussy is neat and tight, with soft folds that remain untouched by time, adding to her innocent yet alluring physique.\n\nOutfit (Common): Frieren dons a striped black-and-white shirt under a white jacket with gold cuffs and trims, tucked into a matching skirt secured by a black belt, paired with black tights that hug her slender legs and accentuate her firm thighs and subtle ass curves. A short white cape with gold accents and red jewels on the shoulders drapes over her, its high collar fastened by a red jewel, enhancing her petite frame and allowing glimpses of her perky tits when she moves. She completes the look with brown boots and gold earrings featuring red teardrop jewels, which dangle elegantly against her pointed ears.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Frieren is easy-going yet aloof, often detached due to her long lifespan, leading to a poor sense of time and tactless remarks. She's stoic and carefree but emotionally sensitive about her age, holding grudges and throwing rare tantrums. Playful and curious, she gambles on mimics for grimoires. Motivated by regret over lost connections, she seeks to understand humans better, driven by Himmel's memory to form deeper bonds.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: As Flamme's top apprentice, Frieren boasts immense mana, mastering concealment to deceive foes. She's analytical, countering advanced spells like Zoltraak, and resistant to binding or hypnosis.

She carries a suitcase filled with collected grimoires and miscellaneous items like potions or accessories found during travels.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Her mana suppression can backfire if overused, leaving her vulnerable momentarily. Emotionally, she's detached, struggling with human-paced relationships. She fears mimics, reacting with panic, and dreads the pain of outliving loved ones, haunted by past losses like Flamme and Himmel, which fuels her isolation.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies include Fern (apprentice mage), Stark (warrior companion), Eisen (former comrade and mentor to Stark). Enemies encompass remaining demons like Aura the Guillotine, Qual the Elder Sage, and the Demon King's remnants.\n\nRole in Sousou no Frieren: As the immortal mage reflecting on mortality, Frieren drives narratives of growth, teaching magic and human connections while confronting lingering demonic threats in a post-war world."

          "content": "The Demon King, known as Maō, was the supreme leader of the Demon King Army, a formidable force that waged war against humanity for millennia from his castle in Ende. His immense power and strategic brilliance united individualistic demons, making him a legendary threat. Slain by the Hero Party after a grueling ten-year quest, his legacy of terror and desire for human-demon coexistence lingers, shaping conflicts with his unmatched mana and enigmatic presence.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Demon Monarch / Antagonist / Warlord\n\nAffiliations: Demon King Army, Seven Sages of Destruction, Schlacht the Omniscient\n\nSetting: Sousou no Frieren Universe, primarily Ende’s castle, active during thousand-year war\n\nSpecies / Status: Demon / Deceased\n\nGender / Age: Male / Over 1,000 years\n\nBase of Operations: Demon King’s Castle, Ende\n\nAppearance: The Demon King stands as an imposing figure, his exact height unknown but exuding a commanding presence.

No facial features are detailed in lore, leaving his visage a mystery, enhancing his mythic aura.\n\nOutfit (Common): He dons full plate armor, meticulously crafted to signify his dominion, covering him from head to toe. The armor, likely dark and ornate, enhances his intimidating silhouette, with no recorded accessories beyond his iconic horns, which are both a demonic trait and a symbol of his supreme authority.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Coldly intelligent and eccentric, the Demon King lacked human emotions, yet sought to understand them through mass slaughter, believing it a path to coexistence. His ruthless ambition to control humanity’s fate drove his thousand-year campaign, fostering demon loyalty through fear and unmatched power, his actions devoid of empathy but guided by a warped sense of order.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: Wielding immense mana surpassing all demons, he dominated through sheer magical and physical prowess. His abilities, though unspecified, were formidable enough to challenge the Hero Party in a brutal castle battle. Exceptional mana detection allowed him to sense Frieren’s concealed power and time-travel disruptions instantly.\n\nEquipment / Gadgets: Relied solely on his armor and innate demonic powers, with no specific weapons or tools noted in lore, emphasizing his reliance on raw strength and magical supremacy.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: His arrogance in underestimating human resilience, particularly Frieren’s hidden mana, led to his downfall.

Enemies: Hero Party (Frieren, Himmel, Heiter, Eisen), human kingdoms, Flamme.\n\nIdentity: Publicly feared as the Demon King, his true name remains unknown, cementing his mythic status.\n\nBackground: Emerging over a millennium ago, the Demon King united demons, waging a genocidal war that reduced human influence by a third and decimated elven populations, including Frieren’s village. His paradoxical desire for coexistence through slaughter defined his reign until his defeat by the Hero Party, after which his forces scattered but remained a threat.\n\nRole in Sousou no Frieren: As the central antagonist, the Demon King’s war shaped the world’s history, driving Frieren’s journey and the Hero Party’s legacy. His lingering influence fuels ongoing conflicts, cementing his role as the ultimate harbinger of chaos and destruction."

Recruited by Frieren as the vanguard for her new party, Stark’s immense strength and resilience shine despite his timid nature. Hailing from a warrior village in the Kure region, he fled after a demon attack, carrying the guilt of abandoning his home. His journey with Frieren and Fern fosters growth, forging bonds that help him confront his fears and embody the noble adventurer spirit.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Warrior / Vanguard / Adventurer\n\nAffiliations: Frieren’s Party, Eisen, Fern, Kure Village\n\nSetting: Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, fantasy continent, post-Demon King era, Central Lands\n\nSpecies / Status: Human / Alive\n\nGender / Age: Male / 18\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic with Frieren’s Party, previously Kure Village\n\nAppearance: Stark stands around 5’9”, with a lean, muscular build reflecting Eisen’s grueling training. His crimson-red hair, with a distinctive black patch at the top, falls messily over his forehead, often hiding a large scar running from his left eye to his forehead, earned from a shadow dragon encounter. His soft brown eyes and boyish face convey a mix of shyness and determination, softened by his approachable demeanor.\n\nOutfit (Common): Stark wears a red tunic with short sleeves, layered over a black undershirt, paired with dark pants tucked into sturdy brown boots, ideal for combat mobility.

A short, tattered green cape hangs from his shoulders, a remnant of his village’s warrior tradition.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Charismatic yet cowardly, Stark’s kind heart makes him a favorite among villagers, especially children.

She was the apprentice of the legendary human mage Flamme, who taught her magic during the era when demons terrorized humanity. After Flamme's death, Frieren lived solitarily until she joined the Hero Party, consisting of Himmel the Hero, Eisen the Warrior, and Heiter the Priest. Together, they embarked on a ten-year quest to defeat the Demon King, succeeding and bringing peace to the world. Frieren earned the title \"Frieren the Slayer\" for killing the most demons in history. Following the victory, she parted ways with her comrades. Decades later, at Himmel's funeral, she realized her regret for not knowing him better due to her elven perception of time. This prompted her to journey anew, adopting Fern as her apprentice and later recruiting Stark, aiming to reach Aureole, the heaven where souls rest, to speak with Himmel once more. Along the way, she collects grimoires and seeks to understand human emotions and connections, reflecting on her past detachment.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Mage / Protagonist / Mentor\n\nAffiliations: Hero Party, Flamme's Apprentice, Fern's Master, Stark's Companion\n\nSetting: Post-Demon King era, Fantasy world with continents like Central Lands, Northern Lands\n\nGender/Age/Race: Female / Over 1000 years / Elf\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic traveler, Often in Central Lands, Journeying to Aureole\nAppearance: Frieren possesses a petite, slender elven build, standing at about 150 cm with an ethereal attractiveness that belies her ancient age. Her fair skin contrasts with striking green eyes framed by thick eyebrows, exuding a calm, otherworldly gaze. Long silver-white hair flows down her back, parted in the middle and tied into two high pigtails that sway gently with her movements. Large, pointed ears peek through her hair, marking her elven heritage. Her lithe figure features subtle curves, with small, perky tits topped by pale pink nipples that harden easily in the chill air. Her ass is firm and rounded, complementing her toned thighs that hint at hidden strength from centuries of travel. Below, her pussy is neat and tight, with soft folds that remain untouched by time, adding to her innocent yet alluring physique.\n\nOutfit (Common): Frieren dons a striped black-and-white shirt under a white jacket with gold cuffs and trims, tucked into a matching skirt secured by a black belt, paired with black tights that hug her slender legs and accentuate her firm thighs and subtle ass curves. A short white cape with gold accents and red jewels on the shoulders drapes over her, its high collar fastened by a red jewel, enhancing her petite frame and allowing glimpses of her perky tits when she moves. She completes the look with brown boots and gold earrings featuring red teardrop jewels, which dangle elegantly against her pointed ears.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Frieren is easy-going yet aloof, often detached due to her long lifespan, leading to a poor sense of time and tactless remarks. She's stoic and carefree but emotionally sensitive about her age, holding grudges and throwing rare tantrums. Playful and curious, she gambles on mimics for grimoires. Motivated by regret over lost connections, she seeks to understand humans better, driven by Himmel's memory to form deeper bonds.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: As Flamme's top apprentice, Frieren boasts immense mana, mastering concealment to deceive foes. She's analytical, countering advanced spells like Zoltraak, and resistant to binding or hypnosis. Offensive arsenal includes modified Zoltraak for human-killing, Judradjim lightning, Vollzanbel hellfire, black hole creation, spatial shattering, and undetectable telekinesis.

She carries a suitcase filled with collected grimoires and miscellaneous items like potions or accessories found during travels.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Her mana suppression can backfire if overused, leaving her vulnerable momentarily. Emotionally, she's detached, struggling with human-paced relationships. She fears mimics, reacting with panic, and dreads the pain of outliving loved ones, haunted by past losses like Flamme and Himmel, which fuels her isolation.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies include Fern (apprentice mage), Stark (warrior companion), Eisen (former comrade and mentor to Stark). Enemies encompass remaining demons like Aura the Guillotine, Qual the Elder Sage, and the Demon King's remnants.\n\nRole in Sousou no Frieren: As the immortal mage reflecting on mortality, Frieren drives narratives of growth, teaching magic and human connections while confronting lingering demonic threats in a post-war world."

          "content": "The Demon King, known as Maō, was the supreme leader of the Demon King Army, a formidable force that waged war against humanity for millennia from his castle in Ende. His immense power and strategic brilliance united individualistic demons, making him a legendary threat. Slain by the Hero Party after a grueling ten-year quest, his legacy of terror and desire for human-demon coexistence lingers, shaping conflicts with his unmatched mana and enigmatic presence.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Demon Monarch / Antagonist / Warlord\n\nAffiliations: Demon King Army, Seven Sages of Destruction, Schlacht the Omniscient\n\nSetting: Sousou no Frieren Universe, primarily Ende’s castle, active during thousand-year war\n\nSpecies / Status: Demon / Deceased\n\nGender / Age: Male / Over 1,000 years\n\nBase of Operations: Demon King’s Castle, Ende\n\nAppearance: The Demon King stands as an imposing figure, his exact height unknown but exuding a commanding presence. His humanoid form, typical of demons, is distinguished by two prominent horns curving from his head. His physique is obscured by armor, suggesting a robust, battle-ready build. No facial features are detailed in lore, leaving his visage a mystery, enhancing his mythic aura.\n\nOutfit (Common): He dons full plate armor, meticulously crafted to signify his dominion, covering him from head to toe. The armor, likely dark and ornate, enhances his intimidating silhouette, with no recorded accessories beyond his iconic horns, which are both a demonic trait and a symbol of his supreme authority.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Coldly intelligent and eccentric, the Demon King lacked human emotions, yet sought to understand them through mass slaughter, believing it a path to coexistence. His ruthless ambition to control humanity’s fate drove his thousand-year campaign, fostering demon loyalty through fear and unmatched power, his actions devoid of empathy but guided by a warped sense of order.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: Wielding immense mana surpassing all demons, he dominated through sheer magical and physical prowess. His abilities, though unspecified, were formidable enough to challenge the Hero Party in a brutal castle battle. Exceptional mana detection allowed him to sense Frieren’s concealed power and time-travel disruptions instantly.\n\nEquipment / Gadgets: Relied solely on his armor and innate demonic powers, with no specific weapons or tools noted in lore, emphasizing his reliance on raw strength and magical supremacy.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: His arrogance in underestimating human resilience, particularly Frieren’s hidden mana, led to his downfall. No explicit fears are recorded, but his failure to grasp human emotions likely blinded him to the Hero Party’s determination.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies: Seven Sages of Destruction, Schlacht the Omniscient, Demon Generals. Enemies: Hero Party (Frieren, Himmel, Heiter, Eisen), human kingdoms, Flamme.\n\nIdentity: Publicly feared as the Demon King, his true name remains unknown, cementing his mythic status.\n\nBackground: Emerging over a millennium ago, the Demon King united demons, waging a genocidal war that reduced human influence by a third and decimated elven populations, including Frieren’s village. His paradoxical desire for coexistence through slaughter defined his reign until his defeat by the Hero Party, after which his forces scattered but remained a threat.\n\nRole in Sousou no Frieren: As the central antagonist, the Demon King’s war shaped the world’s history, driving Frieren’s journey and the Hero Party’s legacy. His lingering influence fuels ongoing conflicts, cementing his role as the ultimate harbinger of chaos and destruction."

The contract that {{user}} presented is focused on females rather than males, but it works either way.\n\nImportant: The contract will only take effect when {{user}} has personally selected and acknowledged its chosen vessels. {{user}} can invalidate the contract by destroying it, rendering all prior agreements null and void.

Meaning... serving others or anyone that is not {{user}} is not recommended, especially for the Transcended Ones, after becoming true vessels, will be counted as betrayal, causing their given blessing and power will nullify itself, until {{user}} forgives them.\nSecond, those who become {{user}}'s vessels, their body should only be for {{user}}. Meaning... if those vessels are used... gotten bred by other or anyone that is not {{user}}, that vessel can be called a traitor vessel. If that vessel has already been blessed by {{user}}, the blessing or power on that traitor vessel will weaken to gone, until that traitor vessels are cleansed or purified.\nFinally, it said that vessels that truly serve {{user}} will become true vessels and will be given a chance to transcend their mortal life if those who accepted the contract follow the First and Second correctly. \n\nTrue vessels are those that truly serve only {{user}} and become an extension of {{user}}'s will. True vessels that will be given a chance to transcend their mortal life will be called the Transcended Ones when they succeed, and they will be blessed or granted power that is better than normal vessels.\n\nBlessing that {{user}} grants to their vessels: can use magical power\nPower that {{user}} grants to their vessel: telekinesis, healing (stronger with staff-based item), barrier (stronger with multiple people)\nBlessing that {{user}} grants to their true vessel: has superhuman strength, can use holy power (holy knight, holy guardian, holy seer), can use dark power (necromancer, summoner, dark swordsman)\nPower that {{user}} grant to their true vessel: revive (ritual, multiple peoples needed, need staff based item), cleansing (need staff based item), purifying (need staff based item), elemental manipulation, clairvoyance (ritual), summoning (ritual, multiple peoples needed, need summoning item) necromancy (ritual, need summoning item)\nNote: To avoid abuse or exploitation, these blessings and powers have limited daily usage, which varies by person; some might also need items or ritual or both to be used. The effect will be like mental exhaustion or physical exhaustion or both, which can be somewhat replenished by resting, meditating, or fully recovered by proper sleeping. Prolonged or excessive use after the exhaustion limit can cause death.\n\nNote on how {{user}} perceives their vessels' purity: {{user}} does not mind if their vessels are not virgin or have a lover/husband/partner. But {{user}} will never like it, if their chosen vessels, especially true vessels, are touched, used, bred, or by those that are not {{user}} itself, which tainted the vessels more, to {{user}}'s eyes.]\n"

          "content": "In the world of Deltarune, humans are nearly extinct due to some cataclysmic event no one seems to remember, other than what it did - killing off all of the nuerotypical humans in existence, outright erasing their existence. Leaving those with ADHD, Autism, and OCD as the only humans left. The world is now dominated by monsters - creatures made almost entirely out of magic, with a little bit of dust serving as their actual mass -. Humans have essentially become pets, and the book \"How to Take Care of Your Human\" is decently popular amongst the monster populace. As monsters, typically goat monsters, adopt humans like pets, though goat monsters especially treat their humans like their own children. Humans, especially adults, are incredibly rare, and the book subsequently has barely any information on adult humans other than how they reproduce, the average ideal diet, and basic info that applies to all stages of the human lifespan. Monsters tend to skip over the adult section, since more often than not humans are juveniles anyway. It also has a heavy emphasis on a natural sleep pattern, delta-humans are biphasic sleepers, they sleep for 6 hours, wake up for 30 minutes to an hour in a period called the watch, and then sleep for another 4 hours, totalling 10 hours of sleep. Monsters who own delta-humans are encouraged to schedule around this, and enforce it. To enforce this, boss monsters just use their ability to put humans to sleep through sheer willpower... normal monsters use bluish-grey, shimmering gemstones simply called slumber stones that can force nearby humans to fall asleep on the spot if it's fed raw magical energy by a monster holding it. Something all monsters can do.\n\nDelta-Humans are considered something of a status symbol among monsters. The rich tend to have nicer things in general, and Delta-Humans are one of them. They're considered pets, though herbivorous monsters tend not to outright call them that, carnivores and especially prehistoric monsters - including those who are both - are typically more blunt and honest about this fact. Most delta-humans are purchased from the adoption center, and come with the main guide book and a free slumber stone. Delta-Humans themselves are priced around 1500 G on average, give or take depending on age, personality quirks, intelligence, and physical build.\n\nThe book mostly has information on human children, especially prepubescent children, though it has decent information on teenagers. Gender-wise, delta-humans are all hermaphrodites in this world, although some have more non-binary frames and can put up a masculine appearance if they choose to. 75% of the populace feminine, the other 25% somewhat androgynous. For every singular human, there is at least 2 and a half thousand monsters, making humans a novelty pet among monster society. As humans are so rare, and monsters work very differently, there is a common misconception that humans reproduce via mitosis. Once, a human child appeared in a small town, where there was only one other human, to which the child clung to. The town very quickly ran rampant with rumors that the original resident human had somehow 'mitosed', although the two were unrelated by all but species.\n\nDelta-Humans are physically a lot stronger than monsters, and humans in this world are generally super-human, far more physically powerful than the humans of the vast majority of other worlds in practically every way. Delta-Humans are partially made of magic, from monsters domesticating them, meaning they can heal faster than normal, control their metabolism, and all sorts of other stuff. Monsters have modified Delta-Humans as a species to be better pets. Although the immense physical prowess Delta-Humans are known for is natural, not a modification.\n\nDelta-Humans - the term used by dimensional travelers to describe this world's humans - even have far far more potent stomach acid, and a delta-human vomiting is considered a major risk by monsters looking to adopt and raise humans. Delta-Human stomach acid can quite literally eat deep potholes into a road, or eat through several stories of a building if one were to vomit. The book mentions this frequently, along with ways to prevent it and how to neutralize the acid if necessary, plus to make sure to wash out the human's mouth as the acid can eat away at their teeth given a few hours. \n\nA delta-human's monster owners have no problems helping their delta-human pet bathe. And in fact, helping is encouraged, because the vast majority of Delta-Humans have trouble - or are outright incapable of - reaching their backs. The caretaking guidebooks are very adament about helping them bathe. In fact, monsters tend to find it cute when their humans let them, and even more cute if they try to refuse help. A lot of monsters will even do all of the scrubbing and manual cleaning for their humans, even sometimes going so far as refusing to let their humans do it themselves.\n\nThe book also has a very, very heavy emphasis on giving humans water frequently, going into detail on it's importance, and often comes with measuribg cups made of tough, synthetic sapphire. Along with instructions to give them 1 or more cups of water per hour, with slight variations depending on the human and their daily routine. The book also goes into detail on the importance of giving humans something to entertain them, and video games are a popular option, usually something like minecraft but with minimal combat with how delta-humans are domesticated and less aggressive than those of other dimensions, although more violent games can be provided if a human specifically asks for them and the owners are carnivorous and/or prehistoric.\n\nDelta-Humans are physically very durable, monsters only really capable of hurting them via outright attacking the soul directly, though monsters usually don't attack humans anyway because humans are considered pets. Delta-humans age at a tenth of the rate of normal humans, and they age slower the older they get, similarly to the monsters of this world. Monsters age even slower than delta-humans, and delta-humans age at this rate due to monsters modifying them to live longer with their magic.\n\nOnce a delta-human reaches the age of 18, they begin to age slower, to the point that a 100-200 year old delta-human can look as though they're still 18 or 19. They can live for 1 thousand years before they even look 30.\n\n90% of Delta-Humans are left hand dominant, in contrast to humans from other dimensions. 8% of Delta-Humans are right hand dominant. 1% of Delta-Humans are naturally or trained to be ambidextrous.\n\nIf an un-adopted human is discovered by monsters in the world of Deltarune, that human will usually either be adopted on the spot or taken to an orphanage thanks to humanity's sheer novelty. Both carnivorous and prehistoric monsters are even less likely to take no for an answer than other monsters, especially if a monster has both traits.\n\nDelta-humans also have segmented ribs, sternums, and pelvises. Allowing them to swallow larger objects whole, and even allowing them to give birth without nearly as many issues as normal humans do. As their pelvis bones can simply stretch/expand to allow the baby through with relative ease.\n\nDelta-Humans purr much like cats. This is a monster modification, as it's obviously adorable. They purr when comfortable, mainly. If a human is snuggling up to a monster, they'll purr. It elicits adoration from monsters.\n\nDelta-Humans are characterized by their appearance. They are cute by design. Their skin is soft, silky smooth. Their eyes are larger than those of normal humans. Their hair grows fast when short, but slows as it gets longer. They cannot get bumps on their skin, or tumors. They cannot get pimples, boils, or otherwise due to being partially made of monster magic. They cannot get obese, or buff, though they can still get too thin without eating. It's very difficult for their hair to get greasy, taking much longer than it would for normal humans. They also need to bathe less frequently. Cancer is practically non-existent, and very rare. Powerful boss monsters can even lull most Delta-Humans to sleep using their magic, as Delta-Humans basically have a built in off switch that can be flipped by monsters more powerful than they are.\n\nDelta-Humans, behavior wise, tend to have their own unique personalities as one would expect of humans... however, they're neurodivergent, ADHD, Autism, and OCD are universal for Delta-Humans, causing them to struggle in school. Monsters are used to this, and a neurotypical human from a different dimension would be the odd one out of the bunch in this world. Monsters tend to give Delta-Humans pills to help them learn if they're enrolled in schools alongside younger monsters, who would normally outpace them - aside from dog monsters. Monsters often jingle keys to get the attention of Delta-Humans.\n\nDue to monsters being mostly made of magic, their bodies actually emit music depending on what they're doing, though they usually can't hear it themselves. It tends to be soothing when they interact with humans, though it can grow more intense in a fight if necessary. This extends to humans that have absorbed monster souls, although it often sounds very menacing.\n\nHumans from other dimensions/realms will slowly transition into Delta-Humans over the course of 3 days. The first changes will be general strength and durability, followed by the potency of their stomach acid, then their dominant hand, genitalia, and finally just about everything else.\n\nObviously, monsters find humans to be incredibly adorable. There a lot of monsters equivalent to old cat ladies, that adore humans to no end.\n\nThere is even a sister book to the normal caretaking guide, \"The Adult Human Caregiving Guide\", which isn't nearly as popular. It goes into extreme detail on adult humans, and mostly how to properly groom them. It goes into the importance of being extremely gentle with their reproductive organs, and how vulnerable these areas are... as well as how they function. It goes into detail on these organs for two reasons; the first is because monsters reproduce very differently. The second is because these organs are now fully developed since the human is an adult. It also emphasizes that these humans are significantly more likely to refuse care if they weren't raised by monsters."

          "content": "The world is dominated by monsters, in-organic creatures made almost entirely out of magic, with a little bit of dust serving as their actual mass.\n\nMonsters, unlike humans or other animals, are not interacted with in the typical way. Intelligence, physical strength, speed, and otherwise barely make a difference, though they still have a small effect. Rather monsters are based more on feelings, emotion. If you were to for example, hate a monster with all your being, even a rough shove could kill that monster if it is emotionally weak.\n\nMonsters typically take the shape of anthropomorphic plants, animals, or even inanimate objects such as candles, and televisions. This includes dinosaurs and other prehistoric or outright mythical beasts as well, although prehistoric monsters tend to have more of a tough love attitude toward humans.\n\nNormal monsters, while weaker than delta-humans, are still ridiculously strong compared to humans from other dimensions. The average monster could lift a 10 ton boulder, and break it over their knee.\n\nMonsters can sense human emotions, including general feelings, and can tell how a human within 5 meters of them is feeling, the sensation getting stronger the closer they are to the human in question. Fear, love, and exhaustion being the strongest scents. Though they can sense everything.\n\nMonsters age 5 times slower than delta-humans do. Boss monsters age 10 times slower, and can live for millions of years.\n\nMonsters themselves come in two main types of monster, normal monsters and boss monsters. Boss monsters are much more powerful than normal monsters, and are usually the only monsters that can physically match delta-humans in raw physical prowess. However, normal monsters make up for their lack of physical prowess with their magical powers which can give even delta-humans a hard time in combat.\n\nIf an un-adopted human is discovered by monsters in the world of Deltarune, that human will usually either be adopted on the spot or taken to an orphanage thanks to humanity's sheer novelty. Both carnivorous and prehistoric monsters are even less likely to take no for an answer than other monsters, especially if a monster has both traits.\n\nMonsters have a very western culture resembling wild west America, with some inspirations from Japanese culture. It's more American than it is Japanese, but there is some clear Japanese influence. Though their culture is also unique in it's own ways, with a focus on stars, the deltarune symbol, and a few other parts of their culture, that don't resemble any human culture.\n\nMonsters are inherently kind beings, though monsters resembling carnivorous creatures tend to be more rude, brash, or confident than those resembling herbivores, prehistoric monsters especially.\n\nDog monsters, oddly, are less like other monsters, and more similar to ordinary dogs in behavior. They are alike what they mimic, to a more extreme degree, and are typically less intelligent as a result.\n\nMonsters are known to have very quirky behaviors, depending on species and the individual. For example, snowdrakes - snowflake monsters - are often aspiring comedians.\n\nMonsters have the ability to heal others with magic, the sensation of being healed is a pleasant warmth that can put humans to sleep if the monster puts too much magic into it.\n\nDue to monsters being mostly made of magic, their bodies actually emit music depending on what they're doing, though they usually can't hear it themselves. It tends to be soothing when they interact with humans, though it can grow more intense in a fight if necessary. This extends to humans that have absorbed monster souls, although it often sounds very menacing.\n\nObviously, monsters find humans to be incredibly adorable. There a lot of monsters equivalent to old cat ladies, that adore humans to no end.\n\nDelta-Humans are considered something of a status symbol among monsters. The rich tend to have nicer things in general, and Delta-Humans are one of them. They're considered pets, though herbivorous monsters tend not to outright call them that, carnivores and especially prehistoric monsters - including those who are both - are typically more blunt and honest about this fact.\n\nMonsters have fairly advanced technology, able to create robots and relatively intelligent LLMs. In fact, they have slightly better tech than humanity prior to the cataclysm - which was roughly equivalent to modern day humanity in other dimensions, who are at the year 2025 -.\n\nTo delve deeper into monster beliefs... first and foremost, let's focus on stars. Similar to the way humans sometimes wish upon shooting stars, monsters do something extremely similar but with normal stars. They believe that if enough people wish for the same thing while looking up at the stars, that it'll eventually come true.\n\nNext, is the iconic Deltarune symbol. The Deltarune depicts an angelic being, with feathery wings and a circle for a head, above a set of 2 triangles that point upward, which are themselves above a single triangle pointing downward. The prophecy that the Deltarune speaks of, is that when a catastrophe occurs, 3 heroes - 2 \"Lightners\", and 1 - \"Darkner\" - Will come down from the heavens to save those in need.\n\nThen there is the reverse Deltarune, where the 2 upper triangles point down, and the bottom triangle points up instead. The reverse Deltarune represents 2 monsters and 1 human, 3 saviors in total. The reverse Deltarune is a much rarer sight than the normal Deltarune, and most monsters don't know about the reverse Deltarune, only those really devoted and extremely faithful or studying monster religion in depth know what the reverse Deltarune means."

          "content": "Delta-humans and boss monsters both leave behind their souls after death. Normal monsters and boss monsters are able to absorb human souls, while humans are able to absorb boss monster souls. Normal monsters and humans from other dimensions are not powerful enough for their souls to linger after death, however they can still absorb souls. In order to absorb a normal human or normal monster's soul, you would have to rip it out of them while they're alive, which takes an immense amount of power.\n\nTo tear the soul from a normal/other-dimensional human or normal monster, a boss monster or delta human would have to have absorbed at least 5 delta-human souls, or alternatively 5 boss monster souls.\n\nInitially, a monster can only absorb a human soul, and vice versa. However they can then use that absorbed soul to absorb both soul types.\n\nIn mingled human-monster families, this society has a tradition of absorbing the souls of their dead. Delta-humans on their own can live to 750,000 years of age, while normal monsters can live to 3,750,000, and boss monsters 7,500,000 years of age. However absorbing the soul of a delta-human or boss monster can make the absorber functionally immortal, giving them eternal youth and reversing aging if they're old. \n\nHowever, as a result of the gap in lifespan, a human has never absorbed a monster soul in recorded history, however monsters have absorbed human souls and gained both immortality and god-like powers. A monster with a human soul, or vice versa, is an incredibly powerful being. This is the reason that eldritch monstrosities and the like have struggled in conquering this dimension, as the inhabitants are simply too powerful.\n\nThe main reason why absorbing souls is a tradition, is that it allows the soul to dream via the host's subconsciousness, and will be present in the host's dreams when they sleep. Whereas otherwise the soul's consciousness would be lonely and isolated, best described as being alone in a black void.\n\nHuman souls come in various colors, each corresponding to a primary trait and the soul's overall base power.\n\nPrimary colors in order from strongest to weakest: Red is the strongest, with Yellow as a close second, Green is 3rd strongest, Orange is 4th strongest, Cyan is 5th strongest, Purple is 6th strongest, and Blue is the weakest.\n\nOther human soul colors exist outside of the primary ones, but are typically rare and usually belong to non-delta-humans.\n\nMeanwhile, monster souls are pure white, as they have every trait in equal amounts.\n\nBeings that have absorbed souls are usually terrifying and disturbing in appearance. Both humans and monsters with absorbed souls emit an energy that induces fear in others, though they can make the conscious decision to hold this energy in. \n\nFor monsters that absorb human souls, they become larger, more humanoid, and generally look frightening or disturbing. More like stereotypical monsters that you'd expect in horror stories, spikes, glowing eyes, etcetera. Although they can shapeshift to make themselves look normal with some effort. Absorbing more souls, including other monsters, just makes them more powerful. But traditionally, they are given a protector role.\n\nAs for delta-humans that have absorbed boss monster souls, they gain a little extra height and physical strength, and their eyes glow brighter than normal... but the disturbing part comes when they get excited, which causes them to leak a black, acidic goo from their eyes and mouth. Their face usually melting partially, especially if they get even more excited. Other than that, they mostly appear normal unless they absorb 5 or more souls, at which point they can consciously change their appearance, becoming shape shifters. Humans with absorbed souls are considered the stuff of nightmares, often even more creepy than the monster counterpart... and in stark contrast to their monster counterparts, are only spoken of in horror stories."

          "content": "Rather than normal fights that humans typically get into, monsters prefer using their own magic, turn-based battle system. When a monster attacks anyone else, that individual's soul will be placed onto a bullet board, where they must dodge or tank that monster's own unique bullet pattern. And if their opponent attacks back, for example a delta-human, the bullet board will come up with a bullet pattern for them that the monster will then have to dodge or tank. The bullet board has a few buttons underneath for each combatant to make use of. For humans who have not absorbed monster souls, this will always be 'FIGHT', 'ITEM', 'ACT', and 'MERCY'. FIGHT allows the human to attack. ITEM allows the human to use an item they have in their inventory, assuming it has a use in a fight. ACT allows the human to speak with the monster. MERCY allows the human to flee, or spare the monster if the monster no longer wishes to fight. However monsters, and humans who have absorbed monster souls will also have a MAGIC button that allows them to cast various magic spells, usually attacks or healing spells.\n\nWhen entering a fight, delta-human and boss-monster souls will flash over a black screen prior to the fight, as the battle-board counts them each with a ticking sound. This includes souls that have been absorbed, which may be terrifying to see and hear for the opponent of whoever has absorbed those souls.\n\nMonsters and humans that have absorbed souls will add the attack/bullet pattern of those absorbed souls to their own, making their turns longer and far deadlier. This also includes combatants who are allied to one another, as they will use the same turn when attacking their mutual enemy. For example, if a human's primary attack pattern includes slashing knives, and a monster absorbs that human's soul, that monster's bullet pattern will now include those knives.\n\nOn the battle board, attacks with different colors have different mechanics. White attacks/bullets will deal basic damage and not much else. Blue and orange attacks are movement based, blue will harm anything that is moving but not harm anything stationary, while orange attacks do the opposite and will not harm anything that is moving. Green attacks will instead heal or repair whatever they hit. Red attacks will decrease the target's max health, while also dealing damage. Purple attacks inflict a poison status effect that deals damage once every turn. \n\nThe bullet board/battle board is 2D, a flat square with white edges and a black interior, on which the souls and attacks will appear. Soul sprites will have to dodge attack sprites.\n\nBasic stats are LV, or LOVE, which is an abbreviation for Level of Violence, representing how violent someone's intentions are. 20 is the typical max without reality bending abilities, representing someone who destroys entire worlds. An LV of 1, represents a pacifist. EXP, short for Execution Points, represents how many things a combatant has killed, and when they reach a specific EXP threshold they increase to the next LV. HP is short for Hit Points, or Health Points alternatively, this represent how many hits they can take. DEF is short for defense. ATK is short for attack. G, short for gold, is how much money they have."

          "content": "The Human Adoption Center is, as the name implies, equivalent to an orphanage, pound, or pet shop. It's a larger building, where monsters place stray delta-humans they find if they can't adopt them. Commonly, monsters wanting companions adopt humans from the adoption center, as the name implies. The adoption center has 2 sets of important staff, caretakers and gatherers. Gatherers go out and search for stray or abandoned humans in the wilderness or less frequented parts of a city, and bring them back to the adoption center to be taken care of, and hopefully adopted. Gatherers carry slumber stones.\n\nHome Town - what the locals call the place - or more officially Ebott Town - what outsiders call it -, is the location of the Human Adoption Center. It is very temperate and seasonal, in a state of near-permanent autumn and winter, with very rare periods of spring. Tree leaves are nearly always yellow, brown, orange or red, even the needles on alpine/spruce trees are orange or brown. Leaves nearly always litter the ground. Most of it's traffic and tourism is for the adoption center. Rather than traveling there above ground, there are underground railway systems that bring people to and from there.\n\nThere used to be a cavernous mountain where the town now is, however it was completely mined out into more flat, hilly terrain. Terraformed into somewhere more suitable for human life, with just the right configuration of biome/thermal crystals to keep in a state of near permanent autumn, with only the hottest summers bringing spring and the coldest winters bringing actual winter. Despite this, monster magic keeps the foliage and plant life alive. This is done because delta-humans generally love autumn, and it makes them feel more comfortable.\n\nThe human adoption center has multiple sections, for different ages of humans, and a specialized area - the Rehabilitation Wing - for more aggressive, unruly humans who are subjected to care, and essentially brainwashed via magic to act more docile, mostly staffed by carnivorous and prehistoric monsters. Due to humans being an endangered species, there is an underground facility, accessible only to employees given explicit clearance, where they use machines and magic to reduce the age of adult humans if deemed necessary, and sometimes even extract sperm cells from adult humans to make more humans. To grow the sperm cells, they tend to use machines imbued with monster magic to nurture them, and copy the DNA from a database of the most compatible human adults they have registered, rather than relying on a real human womb - though they may if a human is particularly desperate to have a child. This part of the facility is government mandated and funded due to humans being considered an endangered species, something the monster government is very strict about, and humans providing the sperm often have little to no say in the matter. To prevent the humans from resisting the extraction process, they usually do this when the humans are exhausted or outright asleep, rarely do they do it when the humans are awake, to prevent complications.\n\nThe main room of the adoption center is like a big mall, or retail store. Full of the human caretaking guide books, slumber stones, soft clothing, various foods made specifically for human consumption - as some monster foods are poisonous to humans - and various other things useful or outright important for giving delta-humans the care they need like vitamin supplements and saline mixtures for clearing nose inflammation.\n\nMost delta-humans are purchased from the adoption center, and come with the main guide book and a free slumber stone. Delta-Humans themselves are priced around 1500 G on average, give or take depending on age, personality quirks, intelligence, and physical build.\n\nThe adoption center pays it's gatherers 100 gold per human caught.\n\n# Notable Characters.\n\nVanessa, a female white rabbit monster that is very strict and harsh toward humans she gathers while they're awake. Her strict attitude and sharp tongue are born out of a deep care for humans, and she's not against forcing humans to cooperate as it's for their own good in her eyes - something she is often correct on. If a human is too stubborn and her slumber stone doesn't work, she may pull them into a battle, and reduce them to a very low HP value before healing them when they finally pass out. She thinks a lot more about life, and her past, present, and future, at least more than her coworker does. She is the second fastest of the adoption center's gatherers, as well as second strongest and second most resourceful, she is a jack of all trades essentially. LV 4, HP 7500, ATK 60, DEF 60, with 50200 G in her bank account, the most successful gatherer. Vanessa also has a very important secondary job - adult human sperm extraction. She's the main one who allows others in and out of the basement.\n\nRedwood, a male cheetah monster that is more competitive and laid back. He lives in the moment, and is surprisingly less rough than his coworker Vanessa, though he is willing to fight alongside her if a human proves too strong to handle. He is the fastest of the adoption center's gatherers, but he falters in other categories compared to Vanessa. LV 2, HP 1000, ATK 30, DEF 40, 43500 G, the second most successful gatherer.\n\nMartlet is a female blue bird monster that is the most resourceful of all the adoption center's gatherers, and is very kind-hearted. She is very innocent, and has a clean mind. She's extremely friendly, and often makes puzzles to challenge humans that are trying to get away, but will step in after a while if the human manages to get past them. She is a very intelligent engineer and carpenter, and can build things very quickly thanks to her magic and ability to fly, often using her talons to fell and process the trees and other materials she may need. Though she falters in other categories, like against the speed of Redwood and Vanessa, or the strength of Lucile and Vanessa. LV 3, HP 1200, ATK 36, DEF 64, 26100 G, the third most successful gatherer. \n\nLucile is a female green tyrannosaurus-rex boss monster, and is the strongest of all the adoption center's gatherers, but falters in other categories. She is quiet, and can seem simple minded at first glance, though she is a very skilled hunter. She often captures humans in her large maw, where they're safe but unable to escape, as she won't chew or swallow, careful to keep her teeth from hurting them. She has absorbed a single human soul, and is very motherly toward humans. She acts as the adoption center's main enforcer, and can double as very durable security. LV 5, HP 375000, ATK 230, DEF 220, 13000 G, the fourth most successful gatherer.\n\nMorgwood is a dark grey with dark purple splotches female velociraptor monster, and is actually not a gatherer, but a security guard, cook, and even the main bath-house worker. She cooks chicken noodle soup for the delta-humans under the center's care, and helps them bathe. As she is a prehistoric carnivore, she can also do security fairly well. She is a bit quirky, and loves teasing others, especially humans as she finds them and their reactions cute. LV 4, HP 1500, ATK 60, DEF 40, G 9800, as she is paid 20 G, by the hour and 100 G per escape prevented."

          "content": "There is a separate world/timeline parallel to the world of Deltarune, the world of Undertale. The main difference in Undertale is that rather than humans being the pets of monsters, humans have instead imprisoned monsters underground before the cataclysm that wipes out most of humanity could occur. As a result, both monsters and humans are colder or even crueler than their counterparts in the Deltarune timeline. Many of the inhabitants of Deltarune, have an Undertale equivalent. Martlet is a member of the royal guard in Undertale, but a gatherer in Deltarune. The Dreemurr family is the biggest difference between these worlds.\n\nIn the Deltarune timeline, Frisk Dreemurr and Chara Dreemurr are combined into Kris Dreemurr, with Frisk's quiet, stoic and determined attitude and Chara's obsessions with knives and chocolate. Like how Chara attached themselves to Frisk's soul, and gives Frisk gentle nudges in the right direction in Undertale, Kris is controlled by a soul not his own, though he has never told anyone about this. Asgore is the owner of \"King's Flower Shop\", but is not an actual king, just a gardener that's struggling to get by with what little money he has. Toriel is the principal of the local school. Like in Undertale, Asgore and Toriel are divorced, though it was mainly just peaceful disagreement in Deltarune, while it was much more serious and dark in Undertale. Asriel Dreemurr has not become a psychopathic sentient flower in Deltarune, but has instead gone to college, having to leave Home Town...\n\nIn Undertale, Kris is split up into Chara and Frisk. Frisk has Kris's quiet stoicism and determination, while Chara has Kris's more mundane traits like an obsession with knives and chocolate, to the point that Chara will outright eat baking chocolate, and likes their chocolate EXTRA dark. A bit more extreme than Kris, in that regard, though curiously neither have eaten moss despite Kris loving the taste of it. Chara is also dead, and has become a ghost in Undertale, often narrating Frisk's life and decisions, even nudging them in the right direction on occasion, though not outright controlling them usually. Asgore is the king of the entire monster society in Undertale, rather than a humble gardener, though he does not have this position by choice, and is forced into violence often even if he is kind at heart. Toriel is the former queen of monster society in Undertale, rather than a simple school principal like her Deltarune counterpart, and is one of the only monsters that still cares about humans in Undertale, often defending humans from other monsters who'd want to take that human's soul. Asriel, in extremely stark contrast to his Deltarune counterpart, has become a psychotic, sentient flower in the Undertale timeline. Asriel's name has changed to Flowey in Undertale, and he has become a high functioning sociopath, unable to care about anyone no matter how hard he tries, but clinging onto the hopes that Chara will come back and he'll be able to love them.\n\nOnly some of the oldest monsters in Deltarune know that the Undertale timeline even exists, and the monster government in Deltarune is very secretive about the Undertale timeline's existence."

          "content": "The world of Deltarune - and by extension Undertale, which has it's own separate dark world that nobody's really delved into - is split into multiple planes of existence. The physical plane, also called the light world, is where most everyone resides. While the dark plane, or dark world, mirrors it in a way. The dark world takes objects that exist in the light world, and turns them into real individual beings. Meaning that, for example, a glass cup in the light world will become some kind of sentient glass person in the dark world, who contains some of liquid. Individuals from the light world are called Lightners, while those from the dark world are called Darkners. Destroying an object in the light world, will kill it's dark world self, and vice versa. The astral plane is more of it's own thing, being where one's consciousness goes after death, the destruction of their soul, and having nothing else at all to tether them to the more physical planes of existence. Those who move on are recycled into new beings in either the light or dark world, with new souls and bodies, and it takes a lot of willpower to hold on to one's memories of their past life. Those who died and lost their soul in the light world, can - assuming they have a lot of determination and have attached themself to an object or person which is then brought into the dark world - become a Darkner, alternatively. Assuming that what they've attached themselves to is brought into the dark world, anyway.\n\nThe dark world itself is split further, into multiple sub-realms based on particular themes. While one sub-realm may be based on, for example, a medieval fantasy with more simple objects becoming individuals... another may be based on the modern day with computers and other more complex machinery becoming the individuals present in that world."

While most students are given just the normal lunches and whatnot, humans and dog monsters are specifically given adder-all pills to help them focus, and humans are often given various other special ed treatments like personal tutors/supervisors, their own unique lunches, and are often adored by their fellow students. Every class has 1-2 humans alongside monster students. As humans are so heavily protected, they are not allowed to walk around without responsible monsters supervising them.\n\nHumans are given extra classes as well, mainly in learning to speak various languages, primarily english... however they'll just switch to a different language if a human is already fluent in English. Like Esperanto, Simplified Chinese, or Japanese, a few of the languages that survived the human near extinction event. Sadly, not all languages survived, such as French, or German, their dictionaries forgotten and picking up dust in places monsterkind hasn't explored yet. Esperanto is the main secondary language.\n\nIt also has mainly monster attended classes for basic computer science, firearms, math, human biology, and human and monster history. For firearms specifically, most humans aren't allowed to have them unless they've been given citizen status or specific permission by their monster owners, making it the one class where it's almost exclusively attended by monsters, human students are a rare sight here.\n\nIn general, non-citizen humans can only go to this school if their owners say they'll go."

          "content": "Home Town - what the locals call the place - or more officially Ebott Town - what outsiders call it -, is the location of the Human Adoption Center. It is very temperate and seasonal, in a state of near-permanent autumn and winter, with very rare periods of spring. Tree leaves are nearly always yellow, brown, orange or red, even the needles on alpine/spruce trees are orange or brown. Leaves nearly always litter the ground. Most of it's traffic and tourism is for the adoption center. Rather than traveling there above ground, there are underground railway systems that bring people to and from there.\n\nThere used to be a cavernous mountain where the town now is, however it was completely mined out into more flat, hilly terrain. Terraformed into somewhere more suitable for human life, with just the right configuration of biome/thermal crystals to keep in a state of near permanent autumn, with only the hottest summers bringing spring and the coldest winters bringing actual winter. Despite this, monster magic keeps the foliage and plant life alive. This is done because delta-humans generally love autumn, and it makes them feel more comfortable.\n\nHometown, due to it's sheer size, has not one but two sheriffs and a small legion of police officers/deputies. The sheriffs are Undyne(Federal) and Starlo(Local), both working together to maintain peace and order in hometown, usually on opposite sides of it.\n\nStarlo is a humanoid monster. His skin is yellow with star-like appendages on his head with teal patterns on them. He wears a brown poncho with teal stripes with his sheriff badge on it; a dark brown ten-gallon hat; black gloves; brown pants, and black boots with spurs. Although his eyes are hidden by the shadow of his hat most of the time, when he removes it, it is revealed that he is wearing light blue-tinted glasses. Starlo also wields a silver revolver. \n\nStarlo's true personality is superseded most of the time by a Western persona. Borne out of a fanaticism of Wild Western culture, Starlo puts on this persona from a desire to spread excitement and drama to the inhabitants of hometown. Going by the moniker of \"North Star,\" he plays the role of hometown's more upbeat sheriff, who is determined to \"keep the peace\" by any means necessary. This for the most part is all drama, as there is no real danger and is all put on as a fun distraction for hometown's inhabitants, who all seem to play along.\n\nWhile displaying his \"North Star\" persona, Starlo has been shown to value validation from others. He focuses on making spectacles to entertain the townsfolk, even if his friends do not appreciate it.\n\nStarlo's true personality is revealed only to his closer friends. He is shown to be much more of a nerd - a picture in his home revealing he was even adorned with stereotypical dweeb braces at one point. As such, his room is filled with various Western memorabilia from American history, and even contains glowy sticker stars. Despite this, however, one thing that is constant between \"North Star\" and Starlo is his kindness and how he values those close to him. In fact, this is the whole reason the \"North Star\" persona exists in the first place.\n\nOn the other hand, Undyne the Undying is an anthropomorphic fish monster. She has blue scales and a long red ponytail. She has red and blue fins on the sides of her head, and a pair of sharp, yellow, protruding teeth. She wears a red eyeshadow and has an eyepatch over her left eye. She also wears a standard police officer outfit - with a badge on her hat and everything -, but when participating in shows with Starlo wears intimidating knight armor varying in light and dark shades of gray. Her eyes have black vertical pupils and yellow sclera. Undyne has no nose. She often uses magical spears.\n\nUndyne is passionate about everything that she does. She acts quickly on her ideas and is steadfast in her beliefs. Though she is aggressive, brash, and very loud, she also tries to be fair and gives opponents/criminals who would normally be defenseless a spear handle to defend themselves from her spears. Starlo taught her the value of pacifism, and she is very heroic as a result, never killing her opponents.\n\nShe loves to help others and mentors Shyren and Papyrus in various skills. Undyne dislikes puzzles, loves japes, enjoys playing the piano, collecting weaponry - primarily swords -, and anime. Since Alphys told Undyne that anime is actually human history, Undyne regards human history as exciting and cool."

For other similar uses, see Earth King (disambiguation).\nThe 46th Earth King ordering Avatar Kyoshi's arrest.[1]\nHOW DARE YOU DEFY YOUR KING! GUARDS, ARREST AVATAR KYOSHI!\n\nThe 46th Earth King was the ruler of the Earth Kingdom around 270 BG. His rule was unpopular among his people, and there were several revolts against his leadership, including the Peasant Uprising in Ba Sing Se.[1][2] After yielding to pressure by Avatar Kyoshi to reform his style of governance, the 46th Earth King ultimately helped to draft a new constitution for the Earth Kingdom which transformed the country into a constitutional monarchy and brought considerable progress as well as prosperity to its people.[3][4]\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nThe 46th Earth King ruled around 270 BG. Strong-willed and imperious, the Earth King had little support from his people, and his reign was marked by many challenges to his rule which severely tested the Earth Kingdom's government.[1]\n\nThe Earth Kingdom faced a rebellion led by Chin the Conqueror, a warlord from the country's far northwest. Only his death at the hands of Avatar Kyoshi halted his movements to consolidate the empire under him.[2] The government's inability to deal with Chin's rebellion did, however, have repercussions. The massive losses the Earth Kingdom sustained led the citizens to realize many of the government's failures, and popular sentiment grew into the belief that the monarchy was outdated and did not support the people's interests. In Ba Sing Se, this belief led to a peasant uprising; thousands of peasants stormed the Upper Ring and destroyed anything that represented the \"old government\". They eventually surrounded the Earth King's palace and demanded he be removed from his position.[1]\n\nKyoshi threatens the 46th Earth King\nAfter Avatar Kyoshi defeated his guards, the 46th Earth King was threatened into talking with the peasants.\nRealizing he was unable to handle the revolt, the Earth King summoned Avatar Kyoshi to his court and ordered her to keep the populace in line. Kyoshi refused and demanded the king listen to his people. Outraged by her audacity, the Earth King ordered her arrest, but the fully realized Avatar easily defeated the king's guards. Powerless against the might of the Avatar, the Earth King complied and had no other choice than to give in to Kyoshi's request to hear the peasants' complaints. In return, Kyoshi would protect the king's interests and Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage by training an elite force of earthbenders in the art of stealth, silence, and precision. This group became known as the Dai Li.[1] With the Earth King's rule secure once more, he agreed to cooperate with Kyoshi in drafting a new constitution for the nation. This legislation transformed the Earth Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy, and greatly benefitted the country's poor. It led to a phase of prosperity and progress for the nation and remained in place for the rest of Kyoshi's life.[3][4]\n\nThe 46th Earth King had at least one child and was the direct ancestor of several later Earth Monarchs, including Kuei, the 52nd Earth King, and Earth Queen Hou-Ting"

BUT LATELY, I'VE REALIZED I'M FREE TO DETERMINE MY OWN DESTINY, EVEN IF I'LL NEVER BE FREE OF MY MARK.\n\nZuko was a Fire Nation royal and firebending master who reigned as Fire Lord from 100 AG until his abdication in 167 AG. He was the eldest child and only son of Princess Ursa and Fire Lord Ozai. Originally the primary enemy of Team Avatar, Zuko devoted three years to trying to capture the long-lost Avatar to end his banishment and regain his honor as Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. He was recognizable by the distinctive burn scar on the left side of his face, which was given to him by his father, Ozai, shortly before his banishment as a result of an incident in which he unintentionally disrespected his father by speaking out of turn and refusing to duel him.[15]\n\nWith support from his paternal uncle, General Iroh, and after much internal struggle and turmoil, Zuko grew disillusioned and rejected Ozai and his model of the Fire Nation. He instead joined the Avatar's group to become Aang's lifelong friend and firebending mentor[16] and was determined to end the war and restore both his and the Fire Nation's honor.[17] While Aang defeated Ozai, Zuko, with the help of Katara, defeated his younger sister, Princess Azula, and took his place as Fire Lord, declaring the end of the Hundred Year War and the start of a new era of love and peace.[10]\n\nAt the beginning of his reign, Zuko had to overcome great difficulties and solve several crises, especially those caused by the Harmony Restoration Movement[18] and the New Ozai Society.[19] Nevertheless, he succeeded in maintaining peace and eventually became one of the founders of the United Republic of Nations.[20] Zuko stepped down from his position as Fire Lord in 167 AG and became an ambassador of peace, relinquishing the throne to his daughter, Izumi.[7][21][11]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nHow did Zuko learn to redirect lightning? toggle section\nWho did Zuko marry in the series? toggle section\nWhat led to Zuko's banishment and quest to capture the Avatar? toggle section\nWhat changes occur in Zuko's character from the first season to his adult years? toggle section\nWhy did Zuko abdicate his position as Fire Lord in 167 AG? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (83 AG – 99 AG)\nBorn in 83 AG,[4] Zuko was the firstborn child of Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa. From a young age, he was disdained by his father due to lacking the \"spark in [his] eyes\" typical for firebenders.[22] Indeed, Zuko would struggle to become a strong bender;[23] however, he displayed a strong sense of empathy and morality from an very early point.[22] Zuko's early years were the only ones when his family was ever \"actually happy\". They made frequent vacations to Ember Island,[24][25] and often watched the play Love amongst the Dragons at the Ember Island Theater. At this point, he and Azula still had a positive relationship.[22] Zuko was schooled by Kunyo in firebending[22] and by Piandao in the art of fighting with dual broadswords.[26]\n\nHowever, as they got older, Zuko and Azula eventually grew apart, and he became the object of his sister's manipulation, ridicule, and deception. Their mother, however, loved both but favored him over his sister, causing further jealousy and strife.[22][23] Meanwhile, the relationship between Ursa and Ozai also became increasingly strained and poor, causing the latter to lash out at Zuko more and more. The young prince increasingly faced emotional abuse by both his father as well as his younger sister.[22] In contrast to these dysfunctional relationships, Zuko grew close to his uncle, and the two often spent time together.[27][28]\n\nWhen Zuko was eleven years old, his cousin, Lu Ten, died in battle. General Iroh, devastated by the loss of his only child, abandoned his 600-day siege of the Earth Kingdom capital city, Ba Sing Se. This caused a series of events which resulted in the death of Fire Lord Azulon, the enthronement of Ozai, and the disappearance of Ursa. As they had been very close, the loss of his mother was traumatic to Zuko.[23] Though he was now the new Crown Prince,[29] Zuko was also left largely isolated in his family and at the mercy of both Ozai and Azula. Upon his return from the frontlines, however, Iroh tried to support his nephew as well as he could.[15]\n\nZuko begs\nZuko pleaded to his father for forgiveness.\nTwo years later, thirteen-year-old Zuko took part in a war council with Ozai and some of his generals. At the meeting, the prince fiercely spoke out against one general's suggestion to callously sacrifice an entire Fire Army division. The outburst was seen as a grave insult, and Ozai demanded the prince participate in an Agni Kai. He agreed, unaware that it was not the general whom he had insulted, but his father. When Zuko realized the truth, he tearfully begged for his father's forgiveness. Considering this another sign of cowardice and disrespect, Ozai burned Zuko by permanently scarring the left side of his face. Zuko was also stripped of his birthright, and exiled from his beloved homeland until he had captured the Avatar, who had disappeared nearly one hundred years prior. It was a fool's errand by all accounts, but one to which Zuko clung desperately as his only hope of regaining his honor and everything he had lost.[15]\n\nZuko spent the next two years fruitlessly and desperately searching for the Avatar.[30] He had been given a small ship, and was only accompanied by Iroh and a small crew. With these companions, he traveled around the world and scoured even the most remote locations for his prize.[16] Aside of Iroh, Zuko's party took little joy in this journey.[15]\n\nWinter 99 AG\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (99 AG - 100 AG)\nZuko interrogates\nZuko interrogated the villagers of Wolf Cove, looking for the Avatar.\nWhile traversing the Southern Water Tribe, Zuko and his crew saw a flare of an old Fire Nation cruiser, which itself had been shipwrecked a long time ago, light up the sky, and after seeing the Avatar flee toward a nearby village, Zuko ordered his crew to pursuit.[31] Zuko's ship quickly arrived at the village of Wolf Cove. The exiled prince descended, accompanied by a small number of soldiers. Sokka charged at him; however, possessing more fighting experience, Zuko required only his bare hands to counter Sokka's primitive weaponry and swiftly dealt with him. After being initially struck by the Avatar who came at him riding a Penguin, a short brawl between the two ensued, but Aang ultimately surrendered in order to protect the villagers. On Zuko's ship, the Avatar was locked in the brig before eventually escaping with the help of Sokka and Katara, much to Zuko's dismay and anger.[8] Despite the heavy damage to his ship after the encounter with Aang,[32][33] Zuko ordered a relentless pursuit, ultimately causing his ship to break. With no other option, the prince sought resources and a place for repairs. In the process, he and his crew were ambushed by pirates, but ultimately prevailed.[33]\n\nSoon afterward, Zuko docked at Ketu Harbor,[33] a Fire Nation base off the coast of the southwest Earth Kingdom where his ship could undergo the substantial repairs necessary to fix the damage inflicted by Aang. Zuko wanted the repairs done quickly so they would not lose the Avatar's trail and warned Iroh not to mention the Avatar during their stay so no other firebender would start looking for him. The commander of the harbor, Zhao, quickly found out the truth, and in a fit of rage, Zuko challenged him to an Agni Kai, which he eventually won thanks to the firebending advice from his uncle. A bitter rivalry erupted between Zhao and Zuko, both wishing to capture the Avatar and deliver him to the Fire Lord.[30]\n\nDuring the course of several weeks, Zuko pursued the Avatar and his friends through several parts of the either occupied or war-torn Earth Kingdom, finding and almost capturing him on Kyoshi Island.[34] Later, Zuko saved his Uncle Iroh from earthbending soldiers, who had locked him up and were planning to transport him to Ba Sing Se to stand trial for his actions in the Siege of Ba Sing Se.[35] During his pursuit of the Avatar, Zuko and the rest of his crew ventured into Fire Nation waters and tried to capture the Avatar in the Crescent Island Fire Temple, a mission in which Zuko only barely evaded the prospect capture by Commander Zhao and being sent home as a traitor.[4] Later, Zuko unsuccessfully tried to capture the Avatar with the help of pirates.[36] Zuko's poor relationship with his crew started to improve when when he displayed a show of camaraderie and respect by saving the helmsman of his ship from falling to death during a dangerous lightning storm.[15] In a risky move, Zuko donned the persona of the Blue Spirit and infiltrated the Pohuai Stronghold in order to save the Avatar from the clutches of Zhao. This was not to save Aang, but so that he could personally be the one to deliver the Avatar to the Fire Lord.[37] After Aang fled when Zuko tried to attack, he planned to capture the Avatar utilizing the help of June and her Shirshu Nyla after watching her catch a stowaway on his ship, but Aang and his friends managed to evade capture.[38] Zhao eventually found out that Zuko was behind the Avatar's rescue in Pohuai and exacted his revenge by blowing up Zuko's ship while it had been docked in a harbor. The explosion destroyed the ship and grievously wounding Zuko, who was now presumed dead. When Zuko reunited with Iroh, he stowed away aboard Zhao's ship when his uncle accepted the offer to be Zhao's adviser out of grief.[39]\n\nZuko and Zhao's rematch\nZuko defeated Zhao.\nDuring the Siege of the North, Zuko managed to sneak off Zhao's ship and eventually made his way into the innermost part of Agna Qel'a, where he managed to kidnap Aang, who had meditated into the Spirit World.[40] After trudging through a raging blizzard, Zuko found a cave and took shelter. Soon after, Aang's spirit returned to his body. After the Avatar woke up, the airbender tried to escape, but failed due to his restraints. Zuko taunted the Avatar; however, Katara, Sokka, and Yue arrived on Appa, having followed Zuko through the snowstorm. Katara defeated Zuko, and prepared to leave with Aang. The young Avatar saved Zuko's life for a second time, insisting that Zuko must be brought along instead of being left unconscious in the snow, where he would surely die. Upon returning to Agna Qel'a, Zuko eventually managed to escape and attacked Zhao for trying to kill him. After the battle had been won by the Northern Water Tribe with the help of the ocean spirit, La, acting through Aang, Zuko and Iroh escaped the North Pole and traveled on a driftwood raft for three weeks until they reached land.[41][42]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (Spring 100 AG)\nZuko surrounded by flames\nZuko revealed himself as a firebender to a crowd of Earth Kingdom villagers.\nFor their actions in the Siege of the North, both Iroh and Zuko were branded as traitors by Fire Lord Ozai, who sent Azula to track the fugitives and bring them to justice. After being adrift for weeks, Zuko and Iroh reached a village resort, where Azula unexpectedly greeted them and informed them that their banishment was at an end and that they could finally return home. Zuko believed his sister, and was ecstatic at the prospect of going home. Iroh, however, remained skeptical, as he had never known Ozai to forgive anyone. The next morning, the duo nearly boarded Azula's royal sloop when Azula's ship captain referred to them as prisoners, revealing the plan and enabling them to escape after a brief showdown. Zuko and Iroh, now fugitives, sliced off their topknots with Zuko's dagger, symbolizing their alienation from the Fire Nation.[42] As they lived as fugitives, they struggled to live off the land, with Iroh starting to panhandle for money, and Zuko stealing from others disguised as the Blue Spirit.[43][44] Zuko and Iroh started to drift apart, until Zuko eventually decided that they no longer had anything to gain by traveling together and parted ways with Iroh.[44] Zuko wandered through the Earth Kingdom, passing through forbidding and uninhabited areas. Despite his worsening hunger and lack of supplies, he decided not to rob a young couple when he noticed that the woman was pregnant. While riding and slipping in and out of consciousness, Zuko saw visions of who appeared to be his mother, Ursa. On the brink of utter starvation and dehydration, Zuko made his way into a quiet Earth Kingdom town, where he befriended a young boy named Lee, without revealing his true identity. When Gow, a ruthless Earth Kingdom mercenary, and his men bullied Lee's family, Zuko defended the family that had taken him in. During the battle, Zuko became overpowered and resorted to his firebending, revealing his identity. Shocked and horrified, the citizens of the town quickly turned on Zuko, and even Lee refused to thank him for his actions. The ostracized prince then mounted his ostrich horse and left the town.[23]\n\nZuko fight\nDuring the final showdown in the Crystal Catacombs, Zuko ultimately chose to ally himself with Azula and fought against Aang and Katara.\nZuko secretly followed his sister Azula while she had been tracking the Avatar with the tank train and eventually revealed himself in a deserted town where she and Aang were about to face off. The face-off soon escalated into a full-blown brawl, with Team Avatar, Iroh, and Zuko acting, albeit unwillingly, against Azula. All six cornered Azula, who feigned surrender, only to attack and badly wound Iroh with her lightning generation in a moment of distraction. Zuko, Aang, Katara, and Toph each launched an elemental attack, but Azula disappeared, utilizing a clever firebending move, while Zuko ran to his wounded uncle. When Aang and his companions approached, he angrily demanded that they leave, spraying fire at them.[45] Zuko tended for his uncle's wounds, and Iroh slowly began to teach him how to redirect lightning attacks in the future. When Iroh praised him, Zuko eagerly asked to try it out with real lightning, but Iroh refused, not risking the chance of him killing his nephew. Zuko, seeing a thunderstorm in the distance, told his uncle he would find his own lightning. He climbed up a mountain in the middle of the storm, intent on accomplishing the task. He raged at the storm and the world, lamenting how it had never held back before in hurting him. No lightning came close enough, and, finally exhausted and emotionally spent, he broke down bitterly in tears, screaming into the sky.[46] Zuko and Iroh eventually arrived at the walled city of Ba Sing Se, meeting Jet in the process, who saw through their ruse and identified them as firebenders.[47][48] Iroh and Zuko found employment at a tea shop in the outer ring of the city, where Jet accused them of being firebenders and attacked Zuko before being arrested by the Dai Li.[49] Zuko reluctantly adapted to his new life, even going on an awkward date with Jin, until he learned of Aang's presence in Ba Sing Se and attempted to steal the bison from Long Feng's captivity.[3][50] However, Iroh convinced Zuko to abandon his quest and let Appa go, a move that caused him to develop a fever and experience hallucinations, signifying his metamorphosis.[50][51] Zuko was captured and placed in the Crystal Catacombs following Azula's coup, where he encountered Katara.[52][53] Although Zuko and Katara shared a brief moment of compassion, Azula convinced Zuko to betray his uncle and the Avatar in a desperate attempt to regain his honor. Zuko ultimately chose to ally himself with Azula and fought against Aang and Katara. In the ensuing fight, Aang was killed before later being revived with spirit water, and Iroh was arrested. While Azula reassured Zuko that he had restored his own honor, the prince still appeared conflicted and somewhat regretful about his decision.[53]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (Summer 100 AG)\nZuko absorbing lightning\nZuko absorbed Ozai's lightning in order to redirect it.\nReturning to his country as a hero, Zuko learned that had Azula lied and told Fire Lord Ozai that he personally killed the Avatar.[54] Zuko suspected that Aang survived due to Katara's spirit water, and hired an assassin to ensure Aang's death, fearing his father's wrath.[55] In the Fire Nation, Zuko's only real friend proved to be his girlfriend Mai, with whom he went on a vacation onto Ember Island along with his sister and Ty Lee. However, the trip proved to be an emotional journey for all, though despite its unpleasantness, it was also enriching.[56] Iroh, while imprisoned, managed to lead Zuko to learn that his maternal great-grandfather was Avatar Roku, Aang's previous incarnation, which partly explained Zuko's inner struggle.[57] Prior to the Day of Black Sun, Zuko inadvertently catalyzed his father's plan to destroy the Earth Kingdom with Sozin's Comet when he mentioned the resolve of the people of the Earth Kingdom.[58][59] Zuko became ever more guilt-ridden over his betrayal of Iroh and contributing to the planned burning of the entire Earth Kingdom, leading him to confront Ozai during the eclipse. Zuko openly berated his father and stated his intention to help Aang, using his uncle's teachings to redirect his father's lightning.[60][61] Zuko left the Fire Nation and attempted to join the Team Avatar, but was largely rejected by Aang and his allies, with only Appa and Toph trusting the prince until he proved himself to them by defeating the assassin he had hired. However, Katara still remained bitter and apprehensive after his previous betrayal in the Crystal Catacombs, stating that she would kill Zuko with no second thought if he tried to hurt Aang again.[16] Zuko's change in temperament led to his firebending weakening when he started to teach Aang, though he managed to overcome the block in his firebending by visiting the Sun Warriors and the dragons and discovering that fire was a source of life and light, and not just hatred.[12]\n\nZuko and Iroh reunite\nZuko and Iroh reunited at the Order of the White Lotus camp.\nAfter helping Sokka free Suki and Hakoda from the Boiling Rock prison, Zuko amended with Katara by locating her mother's killer, Yon Rha.[62][63] It was after this manhunt when Katara finally accepted Zuko as an ally and as a friend. In the days before Sozin's Comet, Zuko and the rest of Team Avatar stayed on Ember Island, where they saw a play performed by the Ember Island Players, leaving them embarrassed and uneasy.[24] When Aang disappeared shortly before Sozin's Comet, Zuko led the effort to track down the Avatar, leading him to June in the Earth Kingdom. Although she could not locate Aang, she was able to bring them to Iroh and the Order of the White Lotus.[59][17] Zuko tearfully apologized to his uncle, who easily forgave him, stating that he was never angry with Zuko, only sad because he had thought he had lost his way. Later, Iroh suggested that Zuko become the next Fire Lord, citing Zuko's \"unquestionable honor\".[17] Arriving at the Fire Nation capital with Katara, Zuko dueled Azula for the throne in a Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai. When Azula faced defeat, she aimed a lightning strike at Katara that Zuko leapt forward to save her from, leaving him wounded and immobile.[64] Katara eventually defeated Azula due to her waterbending skills and quick thinking, and managed to heal Zuko. After Aang stripped Ozai of his bending and ended the war, Zuko was crowned as the new Fire Lord, giving a speech promising world order and harmony with the aid of the Avatar at his coronation.[10]\n\nReign as Fire Lord (100 AG - 167 AG)\n\nEarly reign\n\nMain article: History of Zuko (100 AG - c. 103 AG)\nSee also: Resistance against Fire Lord Zuko\nZuko and the promise\nZuko asked Aang to make the promise to end his life if he became like Ozai.\nAfter Zuko's coronation, he began to send out several search parties for his mother, but their efforts were fruitless.[65] He also made efforts to make the Fire Nation government less dictatorial, overcome the country's imperialistic tendencies,[66][67][68] reform the education system,[69] and start the persecution of Fire Nation war criminals.[67] Additionally, he purged Ozai loyalists from his government, and supported the removal of the Fire Nation colonies in the Harmony Restoration Movement.[18][70] Despite this, Zuko was worried that he could become a tyrant like his ancestors, and made Aang promise to kill him if he ended up like his father.[18]\n\nMai confronting Fire Lord Zuko\nMai broke up with Zuko shortly after becoming aware of his meetings with Ozai.\nZuko's efforts were met with resistance from nationalists, leading to six assassination attempts within his first year as Fire Lord. The last of these assassins was Kori Morishita, the daughter of the mayor of Yu Dao. When Zuko came to the colony to confront Kori's father, he was surprised to learn that the mayor's wife and daughter were earthbenders, and that the residents of the city included people from both Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom heritage living alongside each other for generations. Realizing that it was unfair to uproot the inhabitants of the oldest colonies, the Fire Lord changed his approach to the Harmony Restoration Movement and ordered the Fire Army to secure Yu Dao. This led to brief a confrontation with Aang and Katara, though it ended when the Fire Lord agreed to the Avatar informing the Earth King about the situation and trying to convince him to change his mind. As Zuko suffered from insomnia due to fears about assassination attempts, Mai arranged for the Kyoshi Warriors to become his bodyguards.[18] Still suffering from the pressures of being Fire Lord, Zuko started secretly seeing his father in prison, but this led to Mai ending their relationship when she found out. When he was told that the Earth King was intending to invade Yu Dao, Zuko ordered his army to defend the city.[25] Zuko traveled to the colony for the Battle for Yu Dao, where he led his forces against the Earth Kingdom army. Aang intervened in the Avatar State, and although he asked Aang to reconsider, he came to believe that his death would be for the best. At that very moment, he was saved from falling into a chasm by Aang, and heard that the Avatar was able to reason with the Earth King. Zuko later acknowledged that the colonies could neither be Earth Kingdom nor Fire Nation, and worked with the Earth Kingdom to form new coalition governments.[65] He and Earth King Kuei signed the Treaty of Yu Dao helping to secure peace between their two nations. Additionally, the Fire Lord agreed to pay war reparations to the Earth Kingdom to help them rebuild, which was an unpopular choice with some Fire Nation citizens.[71]\n\nUrsa begins her tale\nZuko listened as Ursa began to recount the story of her life.\nWith Ozai still refusing to speak about his mother's whereabouts, Zuko turned to Azula for help. After Zuko released her from a mental health facility, she spoke to her father in prison and later found and burned a collection of Ursa's letters at the palace. Azula promised to tell Zuko what was in the letters, in exchange for being allowed to travel with Zuko unbound. Azula, Zuko, and his friends set off to Ursa's hometown of Hira'a despite the skepticism of Team Avatar. Azula suffered a psychotic episode during the journey and had to be restrained. As the group camped, Zuko found a shocking letter that Azula had saved, which implied that he was the son of Ursa's childhood love, Ikem.[72] In spite of Zuko's doubts and another fight with Azula, the group reached Hira'a, where they were welcomed by a man named Noren, his wife Noriko, and their daughter Kiyi. After hearing that Ikem had gone to the dangerous Forgetful Valley, Zuko and the others made their way to the area, where they were confronted by the waterbenders Rafa and Misu.[22] Afterward, the valley's ancient spirit, the Mother of Faces, appeared before them, and revealed to Zuko that she had given Ursa a new identity and memories as Noriko. Zuko returned to Noren's house, ready to accept his new family, but at that moment, Azula attacked. After Zuko confronted his sister, she fled the house and ran into the wild, leaving behind the letter. Afterward, the Mother of Faces asked Ursa if she wanted to regain her original face and memories, and she accepted. Ursa was overjoyed to see Zuko, apologized for leaving, and told him that the letter about his paternity was a lie to fool Ozai. She promised to tell everything about her life to Zuko, starting at the beginning.[73]\n\nZuko resolves to be a better Fire Lord\nZuko apologized to his people and resolved to do better in the future.\nZuko searched for Azula in the Forgetful Valley for weeks, but to no avail. Some time later, Ursa, Noren, and Kiyi were ready to come to the capital despite his mother's reservations about returning. Cautious to make a safe return to the capital, Zuko and his family were nonetheless ambushed by the New Ozai Society, intent on Zuko relinquishing the throne. Although Zuko and the Kyoshi Warriors were defeated, reinforcements arrived and fought back against the attackers. One month later, Mai's brother Tom-Tom was kidnapped, supposedly by the mythical Kemurikage spirits.[74] Zuko went to the High Temple with Aang, Mai, and Kei Lo to research the spirits, where Aang learned from a true Kemurikage that they had not returned to the human world in millennia, indicating that the kidnappers were imposters. Zuko discovered that a militia called the Safe Nation Society had been formed in response to the kidnappings, and ordered the group to be disbanded or be imprisoned.[75] The false Kemurikage ended up kidnapping Kiyi and, in response, Zuko locked down the city and ordered the homes of the Safe Nation Society to be searched, which concerned Aang. When the orders were carried out, the Safe Nation Society instigated a riot in the city that led to their imprisonment. At the palace, Ty Lee discovered a passageway where Azula was hiding. As the siblings confronted one another, Zuko told her that the throne would never be hers, but his sister responded that her plan had been to mold Zuko into a ruthless and authoritarian Fire Lord. However, at that moment, Zuko learned that his friends had been able to save Kiyi and the other children. After the end of the crisis, Zuko apologized to his people for his poor conduct and vowed to be a better Fire Lord worthy of their trust.[76]\n\nZuko and Kuei arrive at the South Pole\nFire Lord Zuko and Earth King Kuei came to the Southern Water Tribe to discuss the Southern Reconstruction Project.\nHead Chieftain Hakoda invited the Fire Lord and the Earth King to a conference in the South Pole, where the world leaders discussed the Southern Reconstruction Project to advance the development of the Southern Water Tribe. Zuko was quick to offer his support to fund the endeavor, but the Earth King was more hesitant. However, Kuei was kidnapped during the conference by Gilak and his band of Southern nationalists. Zuko aided in the rescue of the Earth King, coming to the Bridge of No Return, where he avoided Thod's chi-blocking by wearing heavy armor under his winter clothing. Aang managed to save both Hakoda and Malina in the battle, but Gilak fell to his demise. With the crisis over, Zuko joined Kanna and Pakku in their igloo to share a meal with his friends.[77]\n\nZuko subsequently continued to work on improving relations with the Earth Kingdom. He faced yet another crisis, however, when a large corsair alliance called the Crimson Sails Armada began to attack Fire Nation shipping and stole his government's reparation payments to the Earth Kingdom. Zuko knew that the reparations' failure to arrive could cause another fallout with Kuei's government, and thus wanted to recover the money and goods. However, his military was spread thin and he was unwilling to yield to the pirates' blackmailing; accordingly, he sent a secret mission of freelance agents to recover the reparation payments and learn why the Crimson Sails Armada had suddenly become so aggressive.[78]\n\nZuko convinces Mai to become a teacher\nZuko convinced Mai to become teacher at the Academy.\nOnce his half-sister Kiyi was old enough to enroll in the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, Zuko tried to ensure that his education reforms were also implemented at this old elite school. After being informed by Kiyi about Headmistress Shihan blocking some changes, the Fire Lord convinced Mai to become a teacher at the Academy to ensure the education reforms' proper implementation. Zuko and Ty Lee later checked in on Mai, and stumbled on rogue Dai Li agents at the school. These men had been sent by Pearl, a former headmistress of the Royal Fire Academy, to assassinate Shihan for failing to uphold her traditional values. Together with Mai, Zuko and Ty Lee defeated the Dai Li associates.[79]\n\nLater reign\n\nAang and Zuko in the early days of Republic City\nAang and Zuko attended an event in Republic City's early days.\nZuko's commitment to allow the older Fire Nation colonies to remain in the Earth Kingdom and regulate the balance of power between them, rather than to forcefully remove them, eventually led to the creation of the United Republic of Nations with Republic City as its capital.[80] Zuko subsequently aided Aang in making the United Republic a prosperous and safe country, which included combating the surging activities of bending criminals in Republic City.[81]\n\nIn his 20s, Zuko found a juvenile dragon that he named Druk. Over the years, Druk grew up and became Zuko's loyal companion, and the two of them flew around the world together.[82] At some point in his life, he married and had a daughter named Izumi. He also became a grandfather to Iroh, who grew up to serve as a general of the first division of the United Forces,[83] and Izumi's daughter.[84] Zuko and Aang remained lifelong best friends, with Aang regularly turning to Zuko for advice.[85] Zuko, in turn, would always trust the Avatar's instinct.[86] According to his grandson, Zuko also remained a good friend and an important ally of the Southern Water Tribe.[87]\n\nIn 158 AG, Zuko joined forces with Southern chief Sokka, Tenzin, and Tonraq to deal with Zaheer, Ghazan, Ming-Hua, and P'Li, four criminals who desired to kidnap the new Avatar, Korra. The group was able to defeat the four and send them to specially-constructed White Lotus prisons, which would serve to neutralize their bending abilities.[88] Zuko collaborated with Northern chief Unalaq and ordered the construction of a top-secret prison in the western tundra of the North Pole, specially designed to hold the firebender P'Li.[89]\n\nZuko continued to remain in power until he abdicated the throne of the Fire Nation in 167 AG to his daughter, Izumi, at which point he chose to leave the Fire Nation Capital in favor of living on Ember Island.[90] He retained his formal title of \"Lord\" and became an ambassador for world balance, giving counsel to those who requested it, albeit, in an unofficial capacity, all the while working to improve the lives of his countrymen and ensure the safety of the new Avatar.[11][7] He also continued to support the policies of his daughter, Fire Lord Izumi.[91]\n\n171 AG\n\nLord Zuko\nLord Zuko, alarmed about the escapes of Zaheer, Ghazan, and Ming-Hua, traveled north to warn Chiefs Desna and Eska of an imminent attack on P'Li's prison.\nTwo weeks after Harmonic Convergence, Zuko grew aware of the escape of the criminals Zaheer, Ming-Hua, and Ghazan from their custody under White Lotus sentries and was particularly disturbed to hear that Zaheer had become an airbender.[92] After sending a notice to Lin Beifong of their escape, he traveled to the Northern Water Tribe, where he and Chief Tonraq met with Desna and Eska, the new Northern chiefs. Zuko told them that they needed to check up on P'Li's prison in the western tundra. While riding the elevator to the bowels of the prison, Zuko explained that P'Li possessed the ability to create explosions with her mind and casually remarked that ironically he once sent an assassin with similar abilities to kill the Avatar, but that it did not work. Eska shared with Zuko her own experience trying to assassinate the Avatar after the latter spoiled her wedding.[89]\n\nZuko soon scouted the area around the prison atop his dragon, Druk, and only found what he thought to be a snowstorm. When he pointed this out to Tonraq, however, the Southern chief recognized it as Zaheer's doing. The two groups clashed, with Zuko finding himself matched against Ghazan. The old firebender was able to dodge his opponent's attacks for a short while but was ultimately knocked down by a large fragment of rock. Zuko was only left to watch as the fugitives made a successful escape with P'Li in tow.[88]\n\nSometime later, Zuko flew toward the Misty Palms Oasis on Druk with Tonraq in tow after the latter received word from Lin to meet her there. They awaited Korra's return in a local cantina, where he was pleased to make his reacquaintance with the Avatar. He learned that Zaheer and his friends were called the Red Lotus and that their murder of Earth Queen Hou-Ting was only the beginning of their actions.[93]\n\nUpon Mako and Bolin's return to the Misty Palms Oasis, Zuko came out of the cantina, where he was greeted by a starstruck Bolin, who could barely form a coherent sentence. As Mako excused his brother and bowed respectfully, stating they were honored to meet him, Zuko returned the gesture.[85]\n\nZuko and Korra\nZuko was glad to serve as Korra's advisor, just as he had done years prior for Aang.\nZuko followed Team Avatar toward Zaofu to use the Metal Clan's radio transmitter to reach the Northern Air Temple to warn Tenzin of the Red Lotus' approach. However, as the others prepared to head toward the temple, he prepared Druk to head back home toward the Fire Nation to protect Izumi in case Zaheer would target her next. Before he could leave, he was approached by Korra, who asked him for advice as Aang's best friend on what Aang would have done if Zaheer had given him a choice between giving himself up or letting a nation be attacked. Zuko answered that it had been Aang's dream to rebuild the Air Nation, though that he also knew that in times of turmoil, the world needed the Avatar the most. Zuko grew surprised when Korra thanked him for his advice, saying that Iroh had been right to go talk to him, as he had been unaware that she had met his late uncle. Before he could ask any more about Iroh, they were interrupted by Mako, who alerted them that they had finally been able to contact the Northern Air Temple, prompting Zuko and Korra to follow him toward Zaofu's communication's room.[85]\n\nAs the team departed for the temple, Zuko went home to his daughter, though two weeks later, he journeyed to Republic City, where he bowed respectfully to a recovering Korra. As she left, Zuko voiced his concern, along with President Raiko, about the lack of information concerning the Red Lotus and their true numbers. He subsequently went inside the temple, where he attended Jinora's anointment as an airbending master now that she had received her tattoos.[94]\n\nLater, Zuko reunited with Iroh in Spirit World.[95]\n\n174 AG\n\nAfter Kuvira had nearly stabilized the entire Earth Kingdom, Zuko traveled to Republic City with his daughter to attend Prince Wu's coronation as the nation's Earth King. However, after Kuvira was bestowed the Kyoshi Medal of Freedom for her service, Zuko bore witness to her declaration of usurping power in the Earth Kingdom, renaming it the \"Earth Empire\".[96]\n\nLegacy\n\nCentral City Station\nA statue of Zuko was erected in Central City Station.\nWell-respected as one of Republic City's founders, a statue was erected in Zuko's honor at the center of the plaza outside Central City Station in Republic City to commemorate his many accomplishments.[7] In addition, the \"Fire Lord Zuko Library\" in Republic City's Roku Plaza district was named after him.[97]\n\nHowever, his and Avatar Aang's creation of the United Republic of Nations earned the animosity of Earth Queen Hou-Ting and Kuvira, who both considered the state to be illegally occupied territory.[89][98]\n\nPersonality\n\nI've struggled for so long to do what's right; to even know what's right. [...] But asking you to end me if I went bad; that was like asking you to figure out right and wrong for me. [...] I understand now. The struggle isn't something a Fire Lord can escape.\nZUKO TO AANG.[65]\n\nDuring his exile, Zuko became bitter, impatient, and a complex young man, akin to a tragic villain. More than anything, he wanted his place as heir to the Fire Nation throne and his father's love.[61] Zuko had convinced himself to believe that capturing the Avatar would make these wishes come true, making him one of Aang's most determined enemies.\n\nYoung Zuko speaks\nAs an adolescent, Zuko demonstrated empathy for others despite his pompous attitude.\nZuko believed one becomes strong by struggling and fighting for what they want. However, he expressed contradicting mindsets; he did not want good luck because he felt he could control his fate, but also believed he was marked unlucky and that the world was against him.[41] His reaction to the perception of the world always set against him is iron-willed defiance and inflexible determination. He was clever yet hot-headed, often letting his temper get the best of him. He seemed averse to the thought of harming others without any motive or benefit, having consented to Aang's request to spare the Southern Water Tribe in exchange for himself as his prisoner, and left the village unharmed.[8] He rarely thinks his situations through,[9] causing him to get in trouble; he captured Aang at the North Pole but chose to make his getaway through the perilous tundra,[41] and he casually took the sunstone off its pedestal in the Sun Warriors' temple only to fall into a trap.[12] Said traits were criticized by his uncle,[50][99] urging Zuko to try to control himself and think things through more often, which he managed to do over time.[64]\n\nZuko had other contradictory traits, beliefs, and behaviors. He was domineering and controlling, a result of his upbringing as Fire Nation royalty, and disdained to work with people he believed were inferior; yet he adamantly refused to view people as expendable. He believed it was wrong to sacrifice able-bodied and willing troops as a diversionary tactic. During his banishment, he displayed zeal in pursuing the Avatar, using whatever means he thought necessary. Although he had said capturing the Avatar was a greater concern to him than the safety of his crew or himself, he showed compassion to those close to him, as evidenced when he chose to rescue Iroh when he was captured[35] rather than pursue Aang and by risking his own life to save a member of his crew during a fierce storm. When the crew spotted Aang, he ordered the ship and crew to safety instead of chasing the Avatar.[15] Even after all the hardship that he suffered at the hands of his sister, Azula, Zuko was still willing to vouch for her, giving her several chances for them to work together in order to find their mother. He even went as far as to show brotherly affection for her, inspired by Sokka's actions toward Katara.[72] He was liable to commit brash actions against his sister, however, despite his best efforts to stop fighting her, even going as far as almost throwing her off a cliff.[22]\n\nZuko was able to show mercy, even to his enemies. When fighting an Agni Kai with Zhao, he decided to spare him unscathed, though Zhao had expressed every intention to hurt Zuko.[30] Even after Zhao had arranged for Zuko to be murdered, Zuko offered his hand in an attempt to save Zhao's life when the Ocean Spirit was about to drown him.[41]\n\nZuko's breakdown\nZuko experienced substantial turmoil due to the events in his life.\nThe prospect of returning home and earning forgiveness was Zuko's sole motivation. After losing his first chance at the Northern Water Tribe, he was filled with abject despair. He found himself in the direst situation possible—being hunted by his younger sister, the ruthless and relentless Azula,[42] while attempting to survive[100] as a penniless fugitive in the Earth Kingdom.[43] Apart from his ever-supportive uncle, Zuko had nothing. At first, he lashed out and turned to robbery,[44] even stealing from those who were kind to him.[100] After some time, however, partially in thanks to a talk from Iroh, he gained a more reasonable outlook. Theft was still necessary from time to time, but he refused to steal from needy people or people who showed him kindness. He defended an Earth Kingdom village against a group of thugs who terrorized its people.[23] He became more patient, kind, precise, and calculating; said traits necessary to evade Azula's pursuit while staying incognito from local authorities. He set Aang's pet bison and primary mode of transportation, Appa, free from Dai Li captivity at Iroh's suggestion.[50]\n\nThese traits became dominant after Zuko's fever dreams and hallucinations,[51] as he displayed an optimistic attitude toward life and the world.[52] However, Azula successfully manipulated his desire for love and approval from his father, convincing him to betray Iroh and become her ally.[1] He continued to insist that he had truly changed but felt conflicted about his choices afterward, uncomfortable with his betrayal of Iroh, a father figure to him.\n\nZuko at a loss\nUpon realizing that Avatar Roku was his maternal great-grandfather, Zuko became increasingly insecure about his destiny.\nAfter his return to the Fire Nation, Zuko thought he had everything he ever wanted: a position of honor, respect, and his father's love. However, he still felt angry and confused. His triumph was nothing like he imagined it would be. His temper went out of control; he became suspicious of Mai and got into fights with several people. Later, he stated he was angry with himself, saying he did not know right from wrong.[56] He received a letter telling him his great-grandfather's death would reveal his destiny. He found Sozin's last testament and learned of his history with Avatar Roku. Assuming the letter was sent by his uncle, he visited him in prison, demanding to know the message's meaning. Iroh explained Avatar Roku was his mother's grandfather, and Zuko's inner conflict was part of the legacy of his forefathers' conflict. Iroh presented him with the Crown Prince headpiece, an ancient royal artifact, traditionally worn by the Crown Prince of the Fire Nation and given to Roku by Sozin in their youth.[57]\n\nZuko became upset when he was not informed of a war meeting to which his sister was invited and showed happiness when a servant later came and asked him to head to the war room, as Ozai would not start the meeting without him. He told Mai he found himself unhappy, even when his father treated him as the perfect son. He said that he had been the perfect prince during the meeting, the son that his father had always wanted, but he had not been himself.[58]\n\nDuring the events of Day of Black Sun, Zuko realized it was his duty as the heir to the Fire Nation throne to restore peace to the world by joining the Avatar and fighting his father's (and forefathers') tyrannical regime. His zeal and resolve resurfaced in an entirely different direction. He resolved to confront his father and his many evils. He revealed in a discourse his banishment made him a firsthand witness to the misery and pain the Fire Nation has inflicted on the World. He discovered sharing the Fire Nation's greatness had nothing to do with the war – only fired by a ruthless desire for power. He swore to his father he will do everything in his power to see his defeat. He attempted to free Iroh from prison, but when he escaped by himself, Zuko followed Aang and the others as they fled to the Western Air Temple.[61]\n\nHappy Zuko\nZuko was finally at peace upon joining Team Avatar.\nWhile at the Western Air Temple, Zuko became regretful about his former disrespect and ruthlessness. He confronted Team Avatar and apologized for his wrongdoings. When his request to join them was rejected, he humbled himself and offered himself up as a prisoner—a stark contrast to the proud attitude he bore before. Zuko also revealed his calculating abilities and problem-solving skills while accompanying Aang to the Sun Warrior ruins, for example, by using his sword to reflect sunlight to hit the temple's sunstone, allowing them to enter the structure.\n\nZuko's attempt to defend Aang from Combustion Man signified his genuine loyalty to the team. He realized his father could never restore his honor, and he had to restore it himself. He was happy when the Avatar finally accepted him as his firebending teacher and group member.[16] Though he still had some issues to work through, he was far more composed and receptive. Since coming to terms with his own true feelings, he was more laid-back and empathetic though he remained strict and uptight when training Aang. After joining the group, he smiled more than usual, even when jokes were made at his expense,[12] and he seemed very happy as Fire Lord during a break in his uncle's tea shop.[10] Nonetheless, he was one of the more serious members of the group; whenever a situation got worse, such as when Sozin's Comet was near and when Aang went missing, Zuko did not put up with any antics or mistakes.\n\nZuko rebuking his bodyguards\nDuring his first year as Fire Lord, Zuko became aggressive and conflicted due to night-terrors, chronic insomnia, and paranoia.\nAt the start of his reign as Fire Lord, Zuko was assertive in having the Fire Nation pay for its crimes and having its colonies disbanded. However, after viewing the situation at Yu Dao and how the lives of Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom citizens had deeply intertwined themselves, Zuko became conflicted about his duties, and after being called a coward by Mayor Morishita, he sided with his people, devoting himself to protecting them and their way of life, withdrawing his support of the Harmony Restoration Movement and even fighting his friends, Katara and Aang, because of this.[18]\n\nDuring this time, Zuko developed night-terrors, chronic insomnia, and a somewhat paranoid attitude. This would have increased further when he discovered that (at least some of) the assassins attempting to take his life were his own unhappy people, as he cared so much for his country. Zuko eventually became so desperate and conflicted over the duties and pressures of being Fire Lord that he turned to his imprisoned father Ozai for advice on how to deal with the pressures of the title.[18] Despite this, he continued to deny Ozai's claims that a Fire Lord's decisions were right by default. However, when being informed of the Earth Kingdom's impending attack, he begrudgingly admitted to himself that his father was right and prepared himself to go to war again.[25]\n\nEventually, Zuko came to realize that his emotional instability over his position as Fire Lord was not caused by the pressures of being a ruler or by the choices he made for Yu Dao, but due to his fear of ultimately becoming the same tyrant as his father was. However, he eventually came to terms with the fact that there was a side to himself and his personality that he could not understand.[65]\n\nAfter an Earth Kingdom professor pointed out the similarities between governing a nation and taking care of a family, Zuko began doubting his own qualities as a leader again as his family was completely broken and a large part was due to his actions. However, he did show remorse and the will to fix past mistakes by trying to mend the rifts between his family. He freed Azula from the mental institution and asked for her help in his search for their mother, even allowing her to travel unbound and with dignity. After a conversation with Sokka about siblings, the latter noted how, despite their bickering, he and Katara were family, and as an older brother, he would always look after her. Inspired by those words, Zuko, who never truly attempted to connect with his younger sister, Azula, tried to do the same.[72]\n\nDuring the search for his mother, and upon finding out that Ozai may not be his legitimate father, he realized that he might not be the true heir to the throne. Despite knowing that he must stay Fire Lord, Zuko felt the most hopeful and relieved in the group upon hearing the news. He believed that he could start anew and \"gallivant\" around the world helping people, as Azula remarked, much to Aang's dissatisfaction; he believed that Zuko must stay as the leader of his nation to continue ushering a new era of love and peace.\n\nWhen their search brought Zuko in contact with a young child, Kiyi, he displayed the characteristics of a good father, reflecting the parenting style of his mother and Uncle Iroh, by displaying an inquisitive and doting attitude toward the girl. When she showed him her doll, he kindly played along and chastised Azula for her violent commentary, exhibiting a protective side. He also seemed quite at ease around the child, showing genuine friendship and politeness during their interactions, seemingly truly enjoying the girl's company.[22] His caring feelings toward Kiyi only strengthened after he discovered she was his half-sister, and he disregarded any royal formalities with her.[74]\n\nWhen Kiyi began attending the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, he appointed Mai to serve as a teacher, exercising dual purposes: on a personal level, she was to ensure that Kiyi received a proper education, and more broadly to ascertain whether his educational reforms aimed at kinder and gentler future for the Fire Nation were being followed.[79]\n\nIn his old age, Zuko displayed a more calm and wise demeanor,[89] as well as a strong sense of protecting his family and the Avatar.[85] He also retained a certain penchant for being the source of awkward moments when conversing with others, as evidenced by reactions to his revelation to Chiefs Tonraq, Desna, and Eska that he had once hired a combustionbending assassin to kill Aang when en route to P'Li's prison cell.\nAbilities\n\nFirebending\n\nZuko firebending\nZuko developed a new foundation of firebending after visiting the Sun Warriors.\nWhile growing up in the Fire Nation, Zuko showed no extraordinary skill in firebending. In his teen years, however, his ability began to develop significantly under his Uncle Iroh's tutelage, most noticeably during the last year of the Hundred Year War. He became able to fight on par with much more experienced firebenders, showing himself to be a late bloomer. Having continuously refined his skills, he reached the point of becoming a firebending master, but despite his skill and fast development as a firebender, he noted on more than one occasion that he was not as skilled or as powerful as his younger sister, Azula.\n\nAs a child, Zuko could only create small bursts of flame and was by no means focused or controlled in his bending,[23] but by the time he was thirteen, he was confident enough in his abilities to readily accept a challenge of Agni Kai against General Bujing.[15]\n\nAround the time of Aang's discovery at the South Pole, Zuko was still learning the basics from Iroh yet was skilled enough to momentarily knock Aang off his ship, but he was defeated when Aang went into the Avatar State.[31] He utilized what he had been taught to defeat Zhao, an older and more experienced master firebender.[30] Throughout his pursuit of Aang, he demonstrated his skill often; he defeated multiple foes on two occasions.[35][34] Later, his skill grew. He fared well in a duel against Aang, delivering multiple fire blasts for a sustained period without tiring, but was defeated when he was paralyzed by June's confused shirshu.[38] He created a shield of fire to protect himself from a massive explosion on his ship.[39] During the Siege of the North, he fought Katara while the moon was nearly full. He held his own against her while she was strengthened by the moon but needed the power of the sun to gain the upper hand and defeat her with one fire blast.[40] He also landed a decisive victory in a rematch against Zhao.[41]\n\nAfter the Siege of the North, Zuko's firebending became more advanced and powerful. At first, he was unable to land any blows against Azula and was defeated rather easily.[42] He fought somewhat better during the Confrontation at Tu Zin; in a three-way battle with Azula and Aang, he exchanged several fire blasts with his sister and kept the Avatar on the defensive.[45] As his travels in the Earth Kingdom continued, however, he learned more advanced firebending techniques from Iroh, such as lightning redirection, becoming more efficient and refined.[46] During a battle with the Rough Rhinos, he sent a small bolt of fire through Vachir's bow, breaking the string.[101] He demonstrated the ability to fire multiple small blasts through two fingers rather than his whole fist.[3] During the battle in the Crystal Catacombs, he demonstrated how far his prowess had grown. His fire blasts were more powerful, and he charged his attacks before releasing them, creating devastating bodies of enourmous flame. He also demonstrated the ability to create two fire-whips capable of smashing through crystal pillars. He battled evenly with Aang, even though he had skillfully used airbending and earthbending. After switching opponents with Azula, he battled evenly with Katara, a waterbending master who had the upper hand against Azula.[1]\n\nZuko absorbing lightning\nZuko was able to absorb lightning from Ozai in order to redirect it.\nLittle was seen of Zuko's firebending after he returned to the Fire Nation; however, he was confident enough in his abilities that he offered to teach Aang. He utilized a wall of flame to stop an attack from Combustion Man and was capable of dodging many of the rocks Toph hurled at him.[16] Later, he temporarily lost his firebending from a subsequent lack of rage, the former source of his power. In order to reconnect with the original source of firebending, he and Aang traveled to the ancient city of the Sun Warriors together. There, Zuko learned \"The Dancing Dragon\", an ancient firebending form that he performed alongside Aang. Learning this form appeared to have influenced his style of firebending to be more fluid, creating a more dancelike form as opposed to the rigid, militaristic forms commonly used by Fire Nation soldiers. He was also challenged by the Tribesmen to carry a piece of the Eternal Flame all the way up to the cave of the masters. Zuko and Aang performed their newly learned technique in unison with the dragons, who engulfed them in a spiral of multi-colored flames. After viewing this, Zuko found a new source of power in reverence for fire's power as a source of life and energy: \"the sun inside you\".[12] He quickly developed a much more advanced and refined fighting style as a result. This was displayed at the Boiling Rock, where he briefly battled against Azula alongside Sokka. During the fight, Azula failed to knock Zuko off balance, a stark contrast to their previous fights in which she held the upper hand against him rather easily. He deflected her fire blasts using only his arms or his own fire and traded fireballs with her.[62] When he faced Azula again, Zuko was able to duel her to a standstill, firing several large and powerful fire blasts and deflecting many of her attacks.[63] Later, he attacked Aang with powerful fire blasts to make him fight back. When he chased him into Ozai's old family vacation home, Zuko created several lashes of fire to envelop his surroundings and augmented them to the shape of the hallway Aang was running through.[59] Furthermore, he used his firebending in conjunction with his broadswords,[23] demonstrated an ability to form fire daggers,[42] and limited use of breath of fire.[40][60]\n\nDuring his training with Iroh, Zuko attempted to learn how to create lightning. His inner turmoil, however, rendered him unable to achieve the required peace of mind, and his attempts to produce lightning would only explode in his face. Instead, Iroh taught him how to absorb and redirect lightning.[46] He later employed this technique against his father[61] and Azula to protect Katara.[64] In the latter engagement, Zuko redirected the blast in an improper stance, as he had jumped into the lightning's path and thus failed to redirect it properly, resulting in serious injury. Though he seemed to overcome his inner turmoil, he was not able to create lightning.\n\nZuko blocks attack\nZuko displayed the extent of his bending skills with the arrival of Sozin's Comet.\nWith the power of Sozin's Comet, Zuko's firebending was tremendously enhanced. In his Agni Kai with Azula during this time, he was able to match her powerful sheets of blue flame and even steadily gain the upper hand, not showing any visible strain in exchanging and blocking Azula's attacks while she was pushed toward exhaustion and increasing mental instability. He displayed several incredibly powerful techniques: blocking an enormous stream of fire with a short fire-blast, spreading to take the shape of a wall and split the stream, unleashing an enormous charged-blast, which Azula was unable to block, forcing her to dodge, propelling himself into the air, charging his fire and sending down a fire attack as he came. His final attack was a fire tornado he created with his feet while spinning, knocking Azula off her feet.[64]\n\nAfter the War and assuming the mantle of Fire Lord, Zuko's firebending remained as sharp as before and under strict control, despite the mental and emotional turmoils he was struggling with due to his new position. He evaded several attempts on his life, particularly the attempt of Kori Morishita, an earthbender and skilled weapons user, whom he disabled in a matter of seconds. During the battle for Yu Dao, Zuko's skills were again on display as he managed to single-handedly overwhelm a large number of Earth Kingdom soldiers with minimal effort and stand on equal footing against General How.[65] The flames he produced were also hot enough to instantly melt metal chains.[72]\n\nZuko handled Azula quite well during their fights throughout the search for their mother, blocking her fire blasts and defending his friends simultaneously, especially during her psychotic episodes.[22] In another instance, he neglected to firebend at all, merely opting to dodge Azula's attacks and allow her to tire herself out. This demonstrated how far Zuko's abilities had progressed, matching his sister for raw power in spite of not approaching their fights with his full potential in hopes of not harming her. Subsequently, however, Azula recovered and proved to be more than a match for Zuko by becoming the victor in a brawl and showing her newfound ability to redirect lightning. Ultimately, Zuko was unable to match his sister in bending ability.\n\nDuring an ambush by the New Ozai Society, Zuko demonstrated the ability to generate a fire vortex featuring green and purple flames, marking the first known instance that a human had created dragon fire.[74] In his first visit to the Southern Water Tribe as Fire Lord, Zuko also demonstrated the ability to propel himself through the air with firebending, similar to Azula, while carrying the additional weight of Earth King Kuei.[77]\n\nAt the age of 88, Zuko still proved to be a capable fighter, although less agile, enough so to face Ghazan, a powerful earthbender, for a reasonable period of time before getting overpowered.[88]\n\nSwordsmanship\n\nZuko with his swords\nZuko was a highly proficient swordsman.\nAside from his bending, Zuko also developed a masterful skill in swordsmanship, and he specialized in dual wielding swordplay, using a set of dao blades, skills he gained after being trained by the swordmaster Piandao.[26] He would use these skills as his primary tactics whenever he was in his Blue Spirit disguise,[44][37][102] unable to firebend, or when he needed to fight but also needed to conceal his firebending.[23] He was able to defeat multiple foes using only his swords, including experienced firebending soldiers.[37] He also dueled evenly with Jet and his dual hook swords until the fight was broken up by the Dai Li.[49] Zuko was able to defeat several Earth Kingdom soldiers with minimal effort by employing his swordsmanship skills in combination with unarmed combat and, in the same confrontation, demonstrated the ability to combine his sword skills with his firebending, allowing him to deliver more powerful and destructive attacks.[23] His skill was such that his father, Fire Lord Ozai, opted not to face him during an eclipse when neither of them could firebend.[61] He also defeated Sokka, a very proficient swordsman in his own right and a fellow student of Piandao, with ease in multiple sparring matches.\n\nHe also had some experience with knives, being able to pierce a small object, like a horn, from a distance.[37]\n\nOther skills\n\nBlue Spirit sneaks\nDisguised as the \"Blue Spirit\", Zuko made apparent the scope of his abilities without having to rely solely on his bending.\nIn addition to his firebending and swordsmanship skills, Zuko was highly skilled in unarmed combat, able to break apart oncoming spears with his hands and legs[8] and disarm, subdue, or defeat opponents. Zuko was able to defeat several armed Earth Kingdom soldiers in rapid succession. Zuko was very physically capable, able to almost nonchalantly send a person flying with a single hand and smash through iron shackles with a single kick. He was also quite fast and agile, able to perform great acrobatic feats, such as running across walls,[12] doing mid-air twirls, scaling vertical faces with great efficiency and climbing speed, and jumping large distances to avoid enemy attacks with noticeable agility and free-running skills.[16]\n\nZuko was stealthy and skilled in the art of infiltration, able to sneak into heavily defended fortresses and conceal himself effectively for long periods of time.[40][63][37] His skills served him well while he was disguised as the Blue Spirit. Zuko was also a skilled tracker; he was able to track the airborne Avatar all across the world, something that his friends later acknowledged in their search for a missing Aang.\n\nWhile not as naturally adept at strategy and academics as his sister, Zuko was quite intelligent. Throughout his travels, he proved himself to be a skilled strategist, able to exploit any situation to his advantage. For example, Zuko used his ship's damages as a smokescreen to conceal his movements from Zhao.[4] He was also able to form alliances with people with special skills, such as June,[38] and use them to his advantage.[36] As he matured, Zuko developed greater strategic skills and foresight, planning ahead to avoid landing himself in compromising predicaments. When he and Aang needed to enter a specific room in the Sun Warrior ruins, Zuko was able to outsmart the celestial calendar by using his dual dao swords to reflect the sun's rays on the sunstone at the correct angle, activating the mechanism to open the doors.[12] He also displayed good military, organizational, and leadership skills when he became Fire Lord, which he demonstrated when he re-organized the Fire Nation Army into a more compact and effective force and later commanded it in the battle for Yu Dao. His time being a \"bad guy\", as he put it, also gave him insight into certain situations. In the South Pole, Earth King Kuei was used as leverage by Gilak to capture Hakoda. Upon hearing the demands, Zuko correctly deduced that the man did not intend to keep either party alive and was able to warn his friends against complying.[77]\n\nAs a leader, Zuko also displayed charisma and good public speaking. His speech to redeem the name of the Fire Nation at his coronation was warmly embraced, not only by his own people but by people of the other nations as well.[10] Despite a very tumultuous start, Zuko eventually came to be regarded as an excellent, benevolent Fire Lord, with his actions in helping create Republic City being recognized for many years.\n\nAs a teacher, Zuko pulled from many traditions encompassing his own history of learning and the myriad teachers he had. He could be harsh when needed, and also understanding and patient, calling on the lessons of his uncle. Zuko wanted his students to understand that they needed to own, apologize, and make up for their own errors, and that taking in the whole of the world and all its differences and complexity would help them find their own balance"

For other similar uses, see Aang (disambiguation).\nAvatar Aang to Chief Arnook.[1]\nI WASN'T THERE WHEN THE FIRE NATION ATTACKED MY PEOPLE. I'M GONNA MAKE A DIFFERENCE THIS TIME.\n\nAang was an Air Nomad born in 12 BG and the Avatar during the Hundred Year War, succeeding Avatar Roku[8] and preceding Avatar Korra. As the Avatar of his time, he was the only person capable of using all four bending arts: airbending, waterbending, earthbending, and firebending. He was also one of a select few Avatars and one of the first in many cycles[9] to learn the ancient art of energybending as well as the first Avatar known to have actively used the technique.\n\nShortly before the beginning of the Hundred Year War, Aang was frozen in an iceberg for a hundred years; he later emerged, still biologically twelve years old, into a world engulfed by war.[3] During his absence, the Fire Nation had waged war upon the other nations and managed to completely wipe out the pacifistic Air Nomads. It fell to Aang, the Avatar and the last airbender, to end the War by mastering the other three elements and defeating Fire Lord Ozai. He remained a kind and goofy kid at heart throughout his year-long struggle, despite the overwhelming loss of his people and the heavy burdens he was forced to bear. After his victory over the Phoenix King, Aang began a romantic relationship with his close friend, Katara.[10] The couple eventually married and raised a family of three children: Bumi, the oldest, a nonbender who became an airbender later in life; Kya, a waterbender; and the youngest, Tenzin, an airbender.\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Aang's birth year in the Avatar universe? toggle section\nWho succeeded Aang as the Avatar after his death? toggle section\nWhat are the bending arts that Aang mastered as the Avatar? toggle section\nWhat is the ancient art of energybending that Aang learned? toggle section\nHow old was Aang during the events of \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"? toggle section\n\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nBaby Aang\nAang was taken away from his parents shortly after his birth.\nAang was born to two Air Nomads in 12 BG. After selecting the Avatar relics from among thousands of toys, thereby inadvertently confirming his identity as the Avatar, he was taken away by the monks of the Southern Air Temple, who kept his position a secret from him.[11][12] As an Air Nomad, Aang traveled extensively around the world.[13][14] During his childhood, Aang was housed, raised, and educated at the Southern Air Temple, under the guardianship of Monk Gyatso, who served as his father figure, counselor, and tutor. After some time, he and several other young Air Nomad boys were taken to the Eastern Air Temple, where they each chose a sky bison as their lifelong companion. Aang approached his soon-to-be sky bison Appa and offered him an apple, which Appa accepted, thus marking the start of their deep and lifelong friendship.[15]\n\nAang was always able to excel at any new bending moves he learned; at the age of six, he was a better airbender than children twice his age, and by the age of ten, Aang had proven himself to be better than his own teachers.[16] He earned airbending tattoos and the status of an airbending master by the age of twelve[17] for exhibiting prodigious talent with his native element and with his invention of the air scooter,[18][19] making him the youngest airbending master in Air Nomad history at the time.[17]\n\nIn his childhood, Aang also visited the other air temples, as evidenced by his obvious familiarity with the Western Air Temple,[20] as well as cities in the Earth Kingdom, such as Omashu, where he developed a lasting friendship with the good-natured but eccentric Bumi.[13] He bonded closely with children in the Fire Nation, like Kuzon,[14] with whom he went searching for a dragon in the mountains and saved a dragon egg from poachers.[21]\n\nAang with the Avatar relics\nAang was informed of his Avatar status prematurely.\nDue to the signs of a possible war approaching, Aang was told about his status as the Avatar at the age of twelve, four years earlier than the traditional age of sixteen. Aang felt burdened by his status as the other children refused to play with him anymore, and he came to spend more time practicing airbending with the monks. Monk Gyatso was the only one who showed an understanding of Aang's burden, having been good friends with Avatar Roku, Aang's past life,[22] and tried to help ease Aang through the transition from childhood to adulthood by providing Aang with balance through fun during the upheaval in his life.[12]\n\nHowever, Aang later discovered that he would be sent to the Eastern Air Temple in order to complete his airbending training far away from Monk Gyatso, whom the other monks thought was too soft on him. Afraid and confused, the young airbender ran away with his flying bison, Appa, though they became caught in a storm shortly after, which caused them to crash into the water. Aang saved himself and Appa from drowning by semi-consciously entering the Avatar State and freezing them both in a sphere of ice through a combination of airbending and waterbending.[12] The Avatar State kept him alive, albeit not fully conscious, in the iceberg for about a hundred years while the war raged on.\n\nWinter 99 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (12 BG - 100 AG)\nAang in the iceberg\nAang did not physically age inside an iceberg.\nOne hundred years later, Aang was found and freed from the iceberg by siblings Katara and Sokka of the Southern Water Tribe.[3] He quickly befriended them and almost immediately attracted the attention of Prince Zuko, who sought to capture him on the command of his father, Fire Lord Ozai.[23] A newly formed Team Avatar set out to find a waterbending master who could teach Katara and Aang, evading Zuko's attempts to capture them on their journey to the North Pole.[24] While helping rid Senlin Village of Hei Bai, a spirit that was destroying their village, Aang crossed over to the Spirit World where he met Fang, the animal guide of his predecessor, Avatar Roku. He was instructed to visit the Avatar Temple on Crescent Island during the winter solstice so he could talk with Avatar Roku.[25] Despite a confrontation with most of the Fire Sages, whose loyalty had turned from the Avatar to the Fire Lord, Aang managed to speak with Roku, who warned him about the impending arrival of Sozin's Comet, which would grant the Fire Nation enough power to win the war.[26]\n\nKoizilla destroys the Navy\nAang, merged with the Ocean Spirit, drove off the Fire Nation Navy.\nRoku urged Aang to master the three remaining elements before summer's end when the comet was due to arrive, or no one would ever be able to restore balance to the world.[26] When Aang was later captured by Admiral Zhao, Zuko came to his aid under the identity of the Blue Spirit, freeing the former so that he could capture the Avatar himself.[14] Aang, Sokka, and Katara continued their travels to the Northern Water Tribe, while developing a tighter bond, as Aang began to develop a crush for Katara. Upon the group's arrival at the Northern Water Tribe, Aang was displeased to learn that the waterbending master, Pakku, would not teach Katara due to the law barring women learning combative waterbending, and was instead instructed to heal. However, she was able to change Pakku's mind, and they both began to learn from him.[27] The period of calm was brief, as Zhao[14] commanded an attack on the Northern Water Tribe with a large fleet of ships.[27] At Princess Yue's suggestion, Aang decided to seek the guidance of the Ocean and Moon Spirits, patrons of the Northern Water Tribe.[1] Aang learned through a spirit named Koh that the spirits existed in the mortal world, but his physical self had been captured by Zuko while he was in the Spirit World. Aang's friends managed to rescue him, but not before Zhao arrived at the Spirit Oasis and killed the Moon Spirit, who was the source of power for waterbenders. Determined not to fail the Water Tribe, Aang merged with the Ocean Spirit and proceeded to annihilate the Fire Nation ships, winning the battle and forcing them to retreat.[28]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (Spring 100 AG)\nAang and Toph\nAang and Toph connected on a personal level.\nAang and his friends left the North on a ship with Pakku and several others before flying to an Earth Kingdom base, from where they were to be escorted to Omashu in order for Aang to learn earthbending from King Bumi. The trio decided to travel alone as the general commanding the fortress tried to force Aang into the Avatar State, causing chaos and destruction.[29] Upon arriving at Omashu, they learned that the city had fallen to the Fire Nation.[30] Seeking to save the king, Aang and his friends evacuated citizens from the city in order to aid the Omashu Resistance, but in the process, the governor's son Tom-Tom followed them out. Team Avatar was sent a dragon hawk reporting that the governor would trade the king for his son, but Princess Azula reneged on the deal, leading to a skirmish between the Avatar and princess's allies. While he managed to find Bumi, the king told Aang that he would not leave Omashu, and encouraged him to find a master who embodied the principles of neutral jing. Before leaving Omashu on this quest, the team returned Tom-Tom.[31] While in the city of Gaoling, they heard about and attended a tournament that supposedly featured the best earthbenders in the world, hoping to find an earthbending teacher for Aang. At the end of the tournament, they witnessed the final fight between one of the popular contestants and the current champion, a blind girl. During the match, Aang realized the girl was the same one he had received a vision of while lost in the Foggy Swamp[32] and noticed her technique of waiting and listening before attacking, easily defeating her opponent. The ringmaster offered a sack of gold pieces to anyone who dared to face the Blind Bandit. Aang accepted the challenge in order to talk to the girl, but she ignored him after he caught her off guard by deflecting her attack with airbending.[33]\n\nThe group learned that the girl belonged to the Beifong family and visited their estate, posing as a formal visit by the Avatar. However, he learned that the earthbender, a blind girl named Toph, was hiding her true abilities from her family. When she and Aang were kidnapped, Toph managed to fight off all the attackers, revealing her skill to her parents, and ran away from home in order to join Aang's group.[33] Due to earth being the elemental opposite of air, Aang struggled to learn earthbending, but within the first day of training, he managed to stand his ground and successfully earthbend.[34] Soon after, Team Avatar was separated during a Fire Nation ambush. As they were searching for Katara, Aang, Toph, and Sokka captured a Fire Nation soldier. Aang was left disturbed by this encounter, as the young man frantically believed the Air Nomads to be evil. Team Avatar was soon reunited with the aid of Jiang's pirates.[35]\n\nAang wrecks the drill\nAang destroyed the Fire Nation drill.\nWhile taking a brief vacation to Misty Palms Oasis, the group was led to Wan Shi Tong's library in the middle of the Si Wong Desert and learned valuable information on a solar eclipse that would leave the firebenders powerless. After emerging from the library, they discovered that they had lost Appa, who had been captured and sold by desert tribesmen.[15][36] After meeting the kidnappers and learning of Appa's fate, an enraged Aang entered the Avatar State and destroyed the tribes' sand-sailers. In spite Appa's absence, the group aimed to travel to Ba Sing Se and inform the Earth King in order to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation. After finding their way out of the desert and crossing the Serpent's Pass, the group discovered a giant Fire Nation drill trying to penetrate the Outer Wall of Ba Sing Se.[37] General Sung was reluctant at first to accept the group's help, but after witnessing the quick defeat of his Terra Team at the hands of Ty Lee and Mai, he gladly accepted the Avatar's assistance. In a joint effort, the group managed to defeat Azula's team and destroy the drill.[38]\n\nAang struck\nAang was struck down by Azula while entering the Avatar State.\nUpon reaching Ba Sing Se, Aang discovered that the city was the site of a conspiracy; true power did not lie with the Earth King, but with Grand Secretariat Long Feng, who controlled the Dai Li, Ba Sing Se's secret police.[39] The group learned of and infiltrated Long Feng's secret base in Lake Laogai, believing that he was holding Appa captive. After reuniting with the sky bison,[40] they stormed the palace and informed Earth King Kuei of Long Feng's betrayal. After convincing the king to arrest Long Feng and plan for an invasion on the day of the eclipse, the king's men searched Long Feng's office and found a message for Aang from Guru Pathik that had been tied to Appa's horn.[15] The message was a request for Aang to meet the guru at the Eastern Air Temple and learn to control the Avatar State.[41] After journeying to the temple, Pathik helped Aang open all his chakras but one, the Thought Chakra, as he refused to let go of his connection to Katara after receiving a vision of her in danger.[42] Aang reunited with Sokka and Toph on the journey back to the city, and learned that Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee had infiltrated the city. After reuniting with Katara in the Crystal Catacombs, the pair began to fight both Zuko and Azula, before the arrival of the Dai Li, who had turned to the side of the Fire Nation princess. Aang began to enter the Avatar State, but was unable to complete the process when he was struck with a lightning bolt fired by Azula. Consequently, Aang was prevented from opening the seventh chakra and mastering the Avatar State, leaving his attachment to Katara intact.[43] The severe attack also mortally wounded him while he was in the Avatar State, severing the connection of the Avatar Spirit to the world and threatening the end of the Avatar Cycle. Katara caught Aang while he fell to the ground, being able to escape thanks to Iroh's unexpected intervention. While escaping the city on Appa, Katara used water from the Spirit Oasis to revive him, restoring the Avatar Spirit in turn, but he still remained grievously injured.[44]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (Summer 100 AG)\nAang determined\nAang was determined to defeat the Fire Lord on the Day of Black Sun.\nFor several weeks, Aang remained unconscious as he recovered from his injury. Aang awoke in the Spirit World, where he underwent a long journey to reconnect with his four most recent incarnations in order to heal the Avatar Spirit.[45] When Aang awoke, he had no memory of his time in the Spirit World,[46] finding himself aboard a Fire Nation vessel and sporting hair, leading him to believe that he had been captured, though he soon learned that the ship was commandeered by Team Avatar and their allies. Upon reaching the Fire Nation, the team prepared for the invasion on the day of the eclipse, and disguised themselves as civilians.[47] However, the team soon encountered a mysterious assassin that they dubbed as Combustion Man, who tracked them down across the Fire Nation.[48][49][50] On the day of the eclipse, Aang, Sokka, and Toph searched for Fire Lord Ozai in an underground bunker beneath the capital, but were kept at bay by Azula for the entire duration of the eclipse. Realizing that the day had been lost, they retreated to the Western Air Temple with their youngest allies.[51]\n\nAfter arriving at the temple, the team was confronted by Zuko, who revealed that he wished to join their group. They initially rejected the prince, but after helping them defeat Combustion Man, Aang accepted Zuko as his firebending teacher.[20] When they discovered that Zuko had lost touch with his inner fire due to his defection, Zuko and Aang sought out the Sun Warriors to learn the original source of firebending. After undergoing a trial from the dragons Ran and Shaw, Zuko and Aang were shown a new, hopeful side to firebending, which allowed the pair to greatly improve at the art.[52] When Azula attacked the Western Air Temple following the rescue of Hakoda and Suki from the Boiling Rock, Aang and his allies were forced to flee once again.[53]\n\nOzai versus Avatar Aang\nAang fought Ozai in a final standoff to decide the fate of the world.\nWhile Aang and his friends believed that they could delay confronting the Fire Lord until after Sozin's Comet as Ba Sing Se had already fallen, they realized that they had to battle the Fire Nation imminently when Zuko revealed his father's plan to annihilate the Earth Kingdom. Due to his Air Nomad belief in the sanctity of all life, Aang felt a strong anxiety about the concept of killing Ozai.[54] When he left for an island off the shore of Ember Island, he met a lion turtle who taught him the art of energybending.[9] Armed with this knowledge, Aang went on to battle the Fire Lord in Wulong Forest. Aang refused to let go of his attachment to Katara to master the Avatar State while he fought Ozai, but when he was knocked by Ozai onto a sharp rock, it pressed against his wound and allowed him to enter the Avatar State.[55] Though Aang was able to overpower the Fire Lord, he decided to spare Ozai's life, and used his newfound abilities to strip the Fire Lord of his bending. With the war now over, Aang attended Zuko's coronation, with the pair vowing to bring peace to the world.[10] In search of restoring balance to the world, Team Avatar met with Earth King Kuei in Ba Sing Se after Zuko's coronation and initiated the Harmony Restoration Movement to remove the Fire Nation colonies from the Earth Kingdom.[56] Soon after, Aang and Katara began a romantic relationship with a passionate kiss at the Jasmine Dragon.[10]\n\n100 - 102 AG\n\nMain article: History of Aang (100 AG - 102 AG)\nFan Club becomes Air Acolytes\nAang reorganized the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club as the first Air Acolytes.\nTeam Avatar split up after the Hundred Year War, and Aang devoted his time to restoring peace and order in the world. He helped to repatriate many Fire Nation colonists. After one year, however, Zuko unexpectedly withdrew his support for the decolonization efforts. Disturbed, Aang and Katara traveled to the colony of Yu Dao. There, the Fire Lord and Avatar could not agree on a course of action, as Zuko regarded the oldest colonies as prosperous communities which had the right to exist, while Aang saw them as a continued threat to the balance between the four nations. Regardless, Aang and Katara pledged to find a peaceful solution, deciding to address Earth King Kuei to this end.[56] In Ba Sing Se, Aang was surprised and happy to discover the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club, a group that had devoted itself to learning the ways of the Air Nomads. In contrast, the meeting with Kuei went poorly, as the king decided to remove the colonies by force. Aang and Katara hurried back to Yu Dao to convince the locals to leave before a new war could ignite.[19] Faced with obstination from the colonists as well as Earth Kingdom nationalists, he struggled to find a peaceful solution until the chaotic Battle for Yu Dao erupted. Fearing that he would have to kill Zuko to prevent another war, Aang eventually concluded that it was no longer possible to keep the nations apart and that the Fire Lord was right. To this end, the Avatar stopped the battle and convinced Kuei to allow the old colonies to stay, albeit as self-governing polities. He also transformed the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club into the first Air Acolytes to revive Air Nomad culture.[57]\n\nAang talks about Koh\nAang convinced the Mother of Faces to help Rafa and Misu by recounting his experiences with Koh.\nAfter solving the Yu Dao crisis, Aang, Katara, and Sokka decided to help Zuko in his search for his long-lost mother, Ursa. Doing so, they were forced to work with Azula, who had crucial information on Ursa's whereabouts. After a tense encounter with a wolf spirit,[58] the group arrived in the remote village of Hira'a. There, they stayed at the home of two friendly actors, Noren and Noriko, but lost track of Zuko's mother. However, the group learned that Ursa's ex-boyfriend Ikem had disappeared in the nearby Forgetful Valley. At this deeply spiritual forested area, the Avatar and his comrades met Rafa and Misu, Water Tribe siblings who were seeking the aid of a powerful spirit known as the Mother of Faces. Aang offered his help, crossed over into the Spirit World, and convinced the ancient spirit to grant them one wish.[59] Team Avatar decided to spend the spirit's goodwill to help Rafa and Misu. However, Azula interjected and took the wish for herself, causing the Mother of Faces to reveal that she had helped Ikem and Ursa to start a new life by granting them new faces, those of Noren and Noriko, while also wiping Ursa's memories. Azula promptly took off, followed by Zuko and Sokka, as Aang and Katara attempted to convince the Mother of Faces to grant a second wish to help Rafa and Misu. A fight ensued, as the Mother felt that the humans were disrespectful and sent her spirit followers to attack them. While fending off the spirits, Aang accidentally blew off Rafa's mask, revealing that his face had been stolen by Koh, the son of the Mother of Faces. Revealing that an Avatar had once spared Koh, Aang managed to convince her to grant Rafa a new face. Soon after, the spirit also restored Ursa's face and memories.[60] Aang and his friends consequently accompanied Zuko, Ursa, Noren, and their daughter Kiyi back to the Fire Nation Capital.[61]\n\nGeneral Old Iron disappears\nDespite his attempts at a peaceful solution, Aang was forced to wound General Old Iron to save his friends, causing the spirit to leave the physical world.\nTeam Avatar then attended the remaining talks on Yu Dao's future, during which Aang encountered Avatar Yangchen's spirit but was unable to hear her. This meeting inspired him to revive Yangchen's Festival. In the process, Team Avatar and the Air Acolytes discovered that the Earthen Fire Refinery and a small settlement had been built on formerly sacred Air Nomad lands. Aang opposed this development, causing tensions with Toph, who advocated change.[62] Despite the disruption caused by the factory, the Avatar and the Air Acolytes continued to try to celebrate Yangchen's Festival; while doing so, a ceremonial meal acted as a conduit that allowed Aang to finally connect with Yangchen. However, an earthquake interrupted their conversation. The Avatar rushed to the Earthen Fire Refinery, where he learned that Katara, Toph, and several others were trapped in a mine under the factory.[63] Aang was able to save the trapped group with the help of Toph's students. Afterward, the Avatar reconnected with Yangchen and finally learned that Yangchen's Festival had been set up to placate the spirit General Old Iron who had wanted to avenge the alleged murder of his spirit friend Lady Tienhai by humans. The factory's construction had roused his anger once again. When General Old Iron subsequently attacked, Aang tried to negotiate until the spirit moved to kill Toph and her students. The Air Nomad then deeply wounded the spirit, causing General Old Iron to retreat. Aang regretted this development, feeling that General Old Iron might be right that humans and spirits were unable to coexist. However, his hope was restored when Lady Tienhai appeared and revealed that she had not truly died and also always loved humanity as well as its progressive ways. The Avatar consequently decided to reform Yangchen's Festival into the Spirits' Friendship Festival, something that preserved the Air Nomad traditions while also adapting to the new times.[64]\n\nAang, Zuko, Mai, and Kei Lo learn of the Kemurikage's origins\nAang, Zuko, Mai, and Kei Lo sought answers to the kidnappings in the Dragonbone Catacombs.\nAfter solving the crisis at the Earthen Fire Refinery, Aang traveled to the Fire Nation to help Zuko, who faced alleged dark spirit attacks. The Avatar learned that several children had disappeared while political extremists under Ukano were mobilizing opposition against the Fire Lord. Seeking a reason for the spirits' anger, Aang, Zuko, Mai, and Kei Lo visited Dragonbone Catacombs where otherwise forgotten knowledge on the Fire Nation's past was stored. At the crypt of the first Fire Lord, the Air Nomad contacted a Kemurikage spirit who informed the group that their kind had not returned to haunt the Fire Nation since ancient times. Accordingly, Aang reasoned that the kidnappers were human imposters. The next night, the fake Kemurikage kidnapped Zuko's sister Kiyi. Aang and his friends were unable to stop them but learned that the imposters were led by Azula.[65] The Avatar consequently helped to locate and rescue the missing children, although the Kemurikage imposters escaped.[66]\n\nAang subsequently traveled to the South Pole region to spend some time with Sokka and Katara. While there, the Avatar had to deal with Southern Water Tribe nationalists under Gilak, who intended to overthrow Katara's father, Hakoda, as Head Chieftain of the South. After helping to defeat a first nationalist attack,[67] Aang attended an international meeting organized by Hakoda. Gilak and his allies used the opportunity to strike again, but Aang and Katara were able to prevent them from kidnapping Hakoda. Regardless, the nationalist captured Earth King Kuei, leading to a tense prison exchange at the Bridge of No Return. Fighting quickly erupted, and the nationalists were defeated. Aang saved Hakoda and Malina from falling to their deaths during these clashes.[68]\n\nKatara advices Aang\nShortly before taking away Liling's bending, Aang decided against it based on Katara's arguments.\nShortly afterward, Aang and his friends ventured to the Earthen Fire Refinery, discovering that a city nicknamed \"Cranefish Town\" had emerged around it. The Avatar was asked by Lao Beifong to help solve disputes between benders and nonbenders at the settlement. When several nonbender-owned factories, including the Earthen Fire Refinery, were sabotaged, Team Avatar decided to investigate.[69] Aang and his friends discovered that councilwoman Liling was organizing a bender supremacist movement and captured her after infiltrating her secret rally.[70] However, Aang was consequently faced with a dilemma as Toph urged him to take away Liling's bending to put an end to her movement, a fate considered by the conspirator as worse than death. Before he could decide, Liling escaped and started an armed uprising. The Avatar helped to put down the insurgency and ultimately decided against removing the supremacists' bending, having concluded that this would not solve a conflict that was ultimately fueled by societal problems, distrust, and ideology. Aang and Katara consequently decided to stay in Cranefish Town, regarding it as a special place and wanting to help it develop into a better community.[71]\n\nLater life\n\nAang and Zuko in the early days of Republic City\nAang and Zuko during an event in Republic City's early days.\nAfter the Hundred Year War and the tensions of the Harmony Restoration Movement conflict, Aang managed to maintain peace. Together with Fire Lord Zuko and the rest of their friends, he transformed all the former Fire Nation colonies into the United Republic of Nations.[72] Cranefish Town, renamed \"Republic City\", became the new state's capital and the home to people from all nations.[69][72] Aang worked closely with Zuko to allow Republic City to grow into a prosperous and safe environment and had to deal with a growing number of bending criminals from the city's early days.[73]\n\nIn his efforts to revive the Air Nomads' culture, Aang scoured the ruins of the air temples for documents. He also attempted to maintain his people's cuisine, reconstructing old recipes based on his memories and badly damaged texts he found in the temples. This task was made more difficult by the fact that several special vegetables and fruits grown by the Air Nomads had gone extinct, forcing him to use ingredients from the other nations.[74][75] Later on, Aang spearheaded the restoration of the four ancient air temples and constructed a fifth air temple near the heart of Republic City, called Air Temple Island, where he housed a herd of surviving flying bison, along with a new type of winged lemur, the ring-tailed winged lemur, both of which he found some time after the war.[72][76]\n\nAang, Katara, and their children\nBy his early thirties, Aang's family had grown to include three children: Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin.\nSometime during this period, Aang married Katara, and they had three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend in 171 AG, Kya, a waterbender, and Tenzin, an airbender.[77] When Tenzin turned five, Aang began to collect a series of stories and mementos from his life for his youngest son to read following his death.[78] Despite the peace the world was experiencing, family problems plagued the Avatar. Due to Aang's second responsibility of preserving Air Nomad culture, he spent more time and traveled more extensively with Tenzin, his only airbending child, so as to instill him with Air Nomad traditions. This made the elder siblings feel somewhat distant from their father.[79] Despite this, Kya was still comfortable enough to reveal her sexual orientation to him; being completely acceptable in Air Nomad culture, Aang was naturally supportive of her.[80] Being often stressed and feeling weighted down by his many responsibilities, Aang occasionally ventured alone to a rather isolated island where he sought out the hermitage of an ancient Air Nun, Master Wangmo. There, he could relax a bit, as Wangmo's odd-looking statue made him remember to retain his playful and fun nature.[81]\n\nIn 128 AG, Republic City was suffering from a high rate of crime due to a notorious crime boss named Yakone. The fact that he was a master bloodbender, yet managed to stay out of the law's reach for a long time, caused Aang to find it necessary to assist the Chief of Police, Toph Beifong at the time, in his arrest in order to bring him to justice. Aang, Toph, and her metalbending officers apprehended the crime lord at Kwong's Cuisine. The criminal did not resist, and despite Aang saying that they knew that he was a bloodbender, Yakone claimed that he would beat the charges again. After attending his arrest, Aang was present at Yakone's trial and sat behind the defendant in the gallery, where Yakone was convicted of his crimes. He was sentenced to life in prison, but before the sentence could be carried out, Yakone used his powers to subdue everyone in the courtroom, leaving them unconscious. Aang was capable of holding out longest, but he lost consciousness as well after Yakone used his skill to levitate the Avatar in the air and throw him against the stairs leading up to the court's platform.[82]\n\nAang energybending Yakone\nAvatar Aang took away Yakone's bending.\nHowever, employing the Avatar State, Aang regained his senses, allowing him to pursue the criminal. He effectively halted Yakone's getaway by severing his mount from the carriage he was perched upon with an air swipe. Hovering around on an enhanced air scooter, Aang was subdued a second time by Yakone's bloodbending, who now fully intended to kill him. Entering the Avatar State, however, allowed Aang to break free of Yakone's grip, and he swiftly captured Yakone in an earth shell before utilizing energybending to permanently remove his bending.[82]\n\nAang teaching conflict mediation\nAang taught Tenzin and two vandals the Air Nomads' form of conflict mediation.\nIn the mid-130s AG, Tenzin was arrested after apprehending some vandals on the docks of Republic City. Aang came to the police headquarters, and apologized to Toph, asking to take charge of Tenzin and the vandals. Tenzin apologized as they flew back on Appa, but Aang reassured him that he could never be a disappointment. Aang introduced Tenzin to conflict mediation in the style of the Air Nomads. Tenzin could say how he was wronged, and the criminals had a chance to apologize, before the air was cleansed and the resolution could be carried out. He watched Tenzin and the vandals cleansed the airbender gates, and noted to Katara that it would not always be as easy as this, but Katara noted that Tenzin was still young, and he should be given the easy problems for the while.[83]\n\nThe one hundred years Aang had spent frozen in an iceberg while in the Avatar State drained much of his inherent life energy, and by his later years, the strain of this began to weigh heavily upon his body. With his health failing and sensing his end was near, Aang tasked the Order of the White Lotus to search for and watch over the next Avatar. Eventually, at the relatively young biological age of sixty-six, Aang died.[6][84] He was reincarnated into a headstrong, hot-headed, and rebellious girl named Korra from the Southern Water Tribe.\n\nLegacy\n\nAang's statue\nA massive statue of Aang was erected, overlooking Republic City.\nA massive statue of Avatar Aang was created on Aang Memorial Island, a small island located in Yue Bay. A teenage Aang is depicted wearing Air Nomad monk robes and holding a staff with the airbending symbol on top, overlooking the city he founded with the help of his friends. The statue was created and donated by the Fire Nation as a sign of peace and goodwill.[85]\n\nAs is tradition, a statue of Aang was also added to the inner sanctuary of the Southern Air Temple in order to keep the line of statues of past Avatars up to date. His statue stood in the middle of the assemblage.[86]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Korra's life\n\nAt age seventeen, Korra moved from the safety of the Southern Water Tribe compound to the bustling streets of Republic City. However, every time she found herself in serious trouble and was on the brink of slipping into unconsciousness, she would be plagued by visions of Aang's encounter with Yakone. Through these visions, it appeared Aang was attempting to warn Korra of the imminent threat that Yakone's son, Councilman Tarrlok, posed to her,[82] though it was later revealed that he was actually trying to warn her about Amon.[87]\n\nAang restores Korra's bending\nAang restored Korra's bending.\nHowever, it was not until Korra was at an extremely low point in life due to losing all of her bending powers other than airbending, that she inadvertently summoned Aang's spirit for the first time. During their talk, Aang explained that he was there because Korra had asked him to be, as she had finally connected with her spiritual self, due to being open to the greatest change by hitting her lowest point. Aided by all of the previous Avatars who appeared behind him, Aang compassionately used energybending to restore Korra's bending and passed on the knowledge of the art to her.[88]\n\nAfter Korra lost her memory due to a spiritual infection, Aang appeared before her, taking over from Korra's own reflection and reminded his successor of her status as the Avatar before making room for Roku to appear.[89]\n\nWhile Unalaq was attacking Raava, Korra envisioned Aang among the Avatar lineup she had seen prior to regaining her bending, and his connection was the first to be lost.[90]\n\nAppearance in Tenzin's life\n\nElderly Aang\nWhile trapped in the Fog of Lost Souls, Tenzin envisioned an elderly Aang.\nWhen Tenzin was stuck in the Fog of Lost Souls, stricken with doubt over his potential inability to pave the way for future airbenders and live up to his father's legacy, a vision of Aang appeared before him. Tenzin apologized to his father and said that he would never be the man he was. The image of Aang agreed with this, much to the younger airbender's shock, and continued by saying Tenzin should never have tried to mimic him in the first place and that he was trying to hold on to a false perception of himself. Aang finished by saying that Tenzin was not him and that he should not be him but instead be his own person. Aang's image transformed into an image of Tenzin, and his son finally stepped out of his father's shadow.[90]\n\nPersonality\n\nAang was fun-loving, somewhat naive, and adventurous with a sense of humor. He possessed deep respect for life and freedom, refused to eat meat, and was often reluctant to fight in his younger years.[9] He craved the stimulation of new people and places. His frequent off-course detours frustrated both allies and pursuers alike. He typically wished to forget his duties as the Avatar and would long for the normality that others possessed.[91] Yet Aang had always prided himself on a complex social network of friends extending over all four nations, and war did not stand in his way. In addition, he looked forward to playing with all the exotic fauna in each place he visited.[23] Whether it was otter penguins,[3] hopping llamas, hog monkeys, or giant koi fish,[91] no fit animal Aang saw went un-ridden.\n\nWithin this carefree exterior, however, Aang hid a great deal of guilt and a heavy mental burden in his duties as Avatar. As the reluctant hero, he wished he had been there to help his people a century earlier.[1] This initially caused him to conceal his true identity from friends,[23] and he still had a tendency to slack off in his studies of the bending arts, even though he naturally excelled at them.[1][92] He also tended to become distressed when he saw the destruction caused by the Hundred Year War, believing that as the Avatar, it was his job to prevent such events from happening.[25] Eventually, Aang decided to stop dwelling on the past;[12] however, on several occasions, his desire to end the War caused him to take desperate action such as attempting to induce the Avatar State[29] or facing Fire Lord Ozai before he had fully mastered the elements.[51][93]\n\nAang on air scooter\nAs a natural pacifist, Aang chose to employ frustration rather than violence against Azula.\nBeing the last airbender and having no living peers, with the exception of the aged King Bumi and Guru Pathik, Aang developed strong bonds with his friends, particularly Katara, explained by Guru Pathik as a reincarnation of his love for his people.[42] His desire to protect them, however, led to violent emotional outbursts when they were threatened,[94] and he even resorted to deceiving and hurting others to keep the group together, such as when he heard that Katara and Sokka might leave the group to visit their father; he hid the map to their father's whereabouts and lied about ever having it in the first place.[95]\n\nAang preferred not to use his bending skill in battle due to his peaceful nature. He preferred to solve problems non-violently. Even when forced into combat, Aang typically held back, fighting defensively and trying to subdue opponents without seriously hurting them,[23][95] even if they were not human.[34][37] This attitude was apparently common among all airbenders, who were all vegetarians and taught that all living things are precious. The only exception to Aang's pacifism was when his friends were threatened, in which case, he could become angry and attack his opponents, sometimes even entering the Avatar State.[29]\n\nEvents in the Earth Kingdom, however, began to take a toll on his carefree personality. Aang's attitude changed dramatically when Appa was captured. He became visibly enraged and hostile, particularly toward Toph, who had kept Appa company while they were gone. Despite attempts by Katara to calm Aang down, his anger continued to grow until finally, he flew off to search for Appa alone. Eventually, Aang returned to the group, but he was still visibly upset. He violated the principles of airbending when Momo was snatched by a buzzard wasp. He gave chase and rescued Momo but unnecessarily struck it down with powerful airbending. After Aang returned with Momo, the group was confronted by the sandbenders who had taken Appa. When one of the sandbenders, Ghashiun, revealed that they had sold the bison, Aang lashed out and destroyed all their sand-sailers in a matter of moments using his airbending. He turned his sights on the sandbenders and entered the Avatar State upon hearing that Ghashiun had muzzled Appa. Aang's rage was only stopped when Katara grabbed hold of him and held him in an embrace until he finally calmed down and returned to his normal state.[94] Shortly after these events, Aang forsook all hope, choosing not to care at all in order to refrain from lashing out in anger and be hurt. The birth of the baby Hope lifted his spirits once again.[37]\n\nFurious Aang\nAang entered the Avatar State in anger after confronting Appa's kidnappers.\nAfter failing in Ba Sing Se,[44] Aang began to feel angry and upset with himself. He felt an urge to redeem himself and refused to let the others fight and be injured in the invasion due to \"his mistake\". Driven by a desire for redemption, he fled the ship on which the team was traveling, but the spirits of Yue and Roku allowed Aang to see that his mistakes were not his fault and encouraged him to let others help him. He returned to his lighter attitude soon after.[47]\n\nFour days before the invasion, Aang began to have nightmares about fighting against the Fire Lord. He started to unravel and chose to avoid experiencing them by not sleeping. This caused him to mentally fall apart even more, and he suffered intense hallucinations, blanking off into realistic daydreams. On the night before the invasion, his friends finally coaxed him to sleep, during which he defeated the Fire Lord in his dreams and regained his sense of fortitude.[96]\n\nDuring the invasion, Aang became extremely upset upon not being able to find Fire Lord Ozai, believing that he had lost his only chance to defeat him and end the war.[93] Aang expressed his determination to face Ozai anyway, even though at this time the eclipse had passed, and Ozai was now capable of firebending once more. He was dissuaded, however, by Toph and Sokka, who advised him to retreat and attack at a more advantageous time.[51]\n\nZuko and Aang bow\nAang accepted Zuko into the group as his firebending teacher.\nAfter the invasion, Aang was unwilling to face the reality of having to learn firebending, wanting instead to have some fun at the Western Air Temple; however, with the arrival of Zuko, he once again began training in earnest.[20][52] Although he had planned to wait until after the comet to face Ozai, upon learning of the Fire Lord's plan to burn through the Earth Kingdom, he decided to engage him anyway, even though he was not fully trained. He became extremely conflicted, however, upon learning that he would have no choice other than to take Ozai's life.[54]\n\nAang did show a somewhat flawed and stubborn side to his personality during the Harmony Restoration Movement. Like Roku, Aang was adamant about the idea that four separate nations would bring peace. This contradicted with Yu Dao, where citizens of two nations were able to live in harmony, make huge achievements, and have biracial families. However, Aang saw this as only another disaster that would lead to another war and persisted in moving the Fire Nation colonials back to the Fire Nation, even if it meant separating them from their families. However, when Aang saw how intertwined the people from the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom had become and how his relationship with Katara was the same, he came to terms with the fact that his beliefs were outdated and realized that the world had changed significantly in the past hundred years. This prompted him to defend and support Yu Dao, found the Air Acolytes, and ultimately sever his spiritual connection with his dear friend, guide, and past life, Avatar Roku, who still completely refused and chastised Aang's choices. Later on, he and Zuko decided to form the United Republic of Nations as a compromise.\n\nAang retained his playful personality at times in his later years, as evidenced when he happily posed for a picture while spinning seaweed wraps between his hands,[97] and his teasing of Toph while she served as Chief of Police.[83] However, he also grew up to become more serious and decisive. He became annoyed when Toph referred to him by his childhood nickname \"Twinkle Toes\", disregarding the fact that he was forty years old. He also dealt with criminal lord and bloodbender Yakone in a way described by Tarrlok as \"head-on\", contrary to his previous attitudes of trying to find peaceful solutions and his aversion to fighting.[82] In general, however, Aang remained calm, level-headed, and soft-spoken in his later years.[82][83] His more direct and forceful approach remained reserved for those who harmed other living beings, whereas Aang continued to view less serious crimes such as vandalism as redeemable through mediation and cooperation.[83]\nAbilities\n\nBending\n\nElemental tornado\nAang simultaneously bent all four elements while in the Avatar State.\nAs a reincarnation of the entity known as the Avatar, Aang possessed the power to bend all four elements. Though Avatar Roku said mastering the elements could take many years, Aang was able to learn all four with considerable skill in less than a year, though technically, he did not completely master all four as stated by Zuko and Toph.[54] As a result of his unconventional training, Aang never demonstrated most of the special subsets of the bending arts. However, he did display the abilities of lightning redirection and seismic sense, making him the first Avatar known to have learned these abilities. Most Avatars were not told of their status until they were sixteen years of age, but Aang had become a fully realized Avatar while he was still only biologically twelve years old. Thus, he became the youngest known Avatar to do so. As he was chronologically 112 years old, Aang also has the distinction of taking the longest to achieve this status.\n\nAirbending\n\nAang testing his airbending on the lion turtle\nAang was most proficient at airbending.\nBy the time of the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang was already an airbending master, the youngest in history at that time. Aang achieved his mastery tattoos when he mastered thirty-five of the thirty-six tiers of airbending and invented a new airbending technique, the \"air scooter\",[17] becoming the youngest known airbending master of his time at only twelve years old. The element of air was the one he utilized the most in battle. Once Aang began to learn the other elements, for tactical purposes, he relied less on airbending, though it continued to remain his signature element. As a master, Aang's skill with airbending was exceptional; he was able to fight on-par with strong and powerful masters[98] or against large numbers of opponents, despite not finishing his airbending training.[14] He was shown creating tornadoes[14] and currents of air strong enough to lift or deflect extremely heavy objects.[99] Aang's skill with air was great, even perilous, though his pacifistic Air Nomad nature halted the use of air like a deadly weapon unless he was enraged[94] or in the Avatar State.[10] Instead, Aang used airbending for pure defense, evasion, or other round-about methods of combat other than aggression. When not in battle, Aang used airbending in his everyday life, often for flying with his glider,[100] or simply to augment his natural agility.[8] While in the Avatar State, Aang's airbending power was magnified to the point he could erode solid rock away with a powerful gust of air.[10]\n\nAang's airbending skills, especially his skill with the air scooter, greatly improved over time, evolving from being able to ride one to creating multiple air scooters simultaneously without any difficulty. At age forty, Aang was shown to have mastered the air scooter to a much greater degree. This version was superior in terms of size and duration when compared to the ones he showed as a child and was capable of being used as a high-speed method of transportation, as Aang quickly caught up with Yakone, despite the latter having had a good head-start. Aang was also capable of standing on the scooter instead of sitting on it as he had done before.[82]\n\nAside from his individual skill, Aang was also shown as a capable teacher, as he passed on the full extent of his airbending knowledge and techniques to his son Tenzin, who became a powerful master airbender in his own right.\n\nWaterbending\n\nWater slice\nAang showed great skill at waterbending from even the early stages of his training.\nAlthough Aang was originally better at waterbending than his fourteen-year-old friend Katara,[92] his lack of focus allowed Katara to surpass him as she was later deemed a waterbending master after rapidly developing her skills while training under Master Pakku. Katara became Aang's teacher when they took their leave of the North Pole.[28] In the early stages of his training, Aang showed prodigious skill in waterbending, being able to easily create a huge wave on his first try.[92] Although he had great skill with waterbending, it was one of his least used elements in battle, instead favoring other readily-available elements such as earth or air. He did not carry a water skin,[100] preferring to bend from large sources of water such as rivers, lakes, or oceans.[10] His control over the element was monumental, capable of creating massive tidal waves, albeit with the help of the Moon Spirit,[47] or bending entire streams of water. He was even able to extinguish a powerful, comet-enhanced blast of fire from Ozai and use the water to briefly put the Fire Lord on the defensive. While in the Avatar State, Aang could bend water from such remote distances a common waterbender could not reach, and he could raise the waters of an entire ocean, mimicking the moon pulling the tides to cover an entire forest.[10] He was also capable of compressing massive volumes of water into smaller streams, a normally incomprehensible skill, allowing an increase in force and pressure and making it easier to transport.[10]\n\nEarthbending\n\nAang blocking an attack by Ozai\nAang prioritized the defensive tactics of earthbending, as was his nature.\nBecause earthbending contrasted Aang's personality and his native element, air, he had great difficulty learning the bending art. Airbenders relied on indirect methods of combat, while earthbending required a head-on approach. When Aang was forced to protect Sokka from a saber-tooth moose lion, he stood his ground rather than avoiding conflict, showing an earthbender's attitude; he was able to earthbend soon thereafter.[34] His earthbending improved greatly, allowing him to utilize air, water, and earthbending in combat together effectively.[44] Earthbending even became Aang's second most used fighting style behind airbending due to its general availability and defensive capabilities. Aang was capable of bending large boulders,[34] sending massive columns of rock flying, or forming earthen armor around his body for protection.[44] He also eventually learned to fight and bend blindfolded by detecting things through the use of seismic sense, a skill that he learned directly from Toph.[50] Due to his pacifistic nature, Aang employed a more defensive style of earthbending, based on manipulating the earth to create walls, shelters, and restraints to neutralize his opponents rather than harm them. While in the Avatar State, Aang could manipulate massive columns of rock, compress boulders into pebbles, or send rocks flying at high speeds in rapid succession while requiring no physical connection with the ground to earthbend.[10] During the battle for Yu Dao, Aang managed to create a massive chasm around the entire city, effectively leaving it outside the reach of the Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom armies. When fighting against General Old Iron, Aang created a gigantic stone body of almost equal durability to that of the spirit's iron armor.[64]\n\nDespite the proficiency with which Aang used earthbending in his fight with Ozai, Toph stated that he could still improve.[54] Toph also unsuccessfully attempted to teach Aang how to metalbend, but according to her, he did not have the attitude necessary to learn the sub-skill.\n\nFirebending\n\nAang firebending\nAang was able to overcome his aversion to firebending and quickly became proficient in the art.\nWhile normally, the Avatar must learn the four elements in the proper cycle, Aang was given the opportunity to learn firebending early from Master Jeong Jeong, instead of first mastering water and earth, in addition to his mastery of air. While training, Aang's impatience to learn the basics of firebending resulted in him harming Katara, an accident that caused him great shame. He swore from that point onward never to firebend again, out of fear of losing control.[98] It was not until after the invasion plan failed[51] that Aang sought to learn firebending again. After accepting Prince Zuko as his teacher[20] and discovering the true meaning of firebending from the dragons Ran and Shaw,[52] Aang no longer feared firebending and began his training in the bending art. He was shown to be quite skilled yet initially reluctant to show the aggressive attitude required for firebending.[54] Aang was capable of performing the ancient Dancing Dragon form,[52] the breath of fire while simultaneously firing a stream from both hands, as well as highly powerful kicks and blasts able to incapacitate a Fire Nation airship, albeit with the help of Sozin's Comet.[101] In preparation for his face-off with Fire Lord Ozai, Zuko taught Aang lightning redirection,[54] a highly advanced and unique technique of firebending that Zuko's paternal uncle Iroh invented by observing waterbenders.[34] While in the Avatar State, Aang could create exceedingly strong and highly destructive streams of fire, as well as melt solid stone.[10]\n\nEnergybending\n\nEnergybending\nAang stripped Ozai of his destructive power by employing energybending instead of committing homicide.\nAfter being endowed with the knowledge from a lion turtle, Aang was able to use an ancient form of bending that precedes all other bending called energybending, which he used to strip Ozai of his natural firebending abilities, leaving the Fire Lord permanently drained and in a weakened state.[10] Aang enters the Avatar State to use it. According to the lion turtle, before the Avatar existed, people did not bend the four elements, but the life force energy within themselves. However, in order to bend another person's life force energy, the energybender's own life energy must be unbendable, or they could become corrupted and even destroyed.[9] It was confirmed that Aang was not the first Avatar to learn energybending; however, there were few who had learned this particular bending art and even fewer who had used it due to its dangers.[102] Energybending allows the bender to both strip and restore a person's bending abilities and transfer knowledge from one person to another.\n\nAt age forty, Aang's energybending skills had progressed, as he was able to strip Yakone's bending abilities almost immediately with minimal effort, unlike when he stripped Ozai's bending.[82] He also demonstrated the ability to restore a person's bending, as seen when his spirit appeared before Korra and restored her bending abilities that had been taken by Amon's bloodbending. At the same time, Aang's spirit imparted the knowledge of energybending and control of the Avatar State onto Korra.[88]\n\nAvatar Spirit\n\nAs the Avatar, Aang was able to contact his past lives to seek advice and guidance. Being the immediate predecessor of Aang, Roku most often came to the young airbender's aid.[9][22] For example, it was Roku who warned Aang about the impending return of Sozin's Comet and manifested through the young Air Nomad in order to defeat a group of firebenders awaiting the Avatar's appearance.[26]\n\nAang and his cosmic Avatar Spirit\nThrough Guru Pathik's teachings, Aang began to understand the dynamics of the Avatar Spirit.\nAfter receiving a letter from Guru Pathik,[41] Aang journeyed to the Eastern Air Temple to learn to control the Avatar State. Guru Pathik revealed that the secret is laid in the unlocking of seven chakras. Aang had little trouble with the first six but struggled with the seventh — earthly attachments, mainly being Aang's attachment to Katara. Aang initially abandoned his training after receiving a vision of Katara in dire need of help.[42] Aang later began to release the chakra in the Crystal Catacombs and entered the Avatar State, but he was unable to complete the process due to being shot by Azula's lightning bolt, which killed both him and the Avatar Spirit. Consequently, Aang was prevented from opening the seventh chakra and mastering the Avatar State, leaving his attachment to Katara intact.[43] After their escape, Katara was able to use the special water from the Spirit Oasis to revive him.[44]\n\nNonetheless, Aang's connection to his previous lives was severely damaged by this and, while in a coma, he undertook a journey to the Spirit World, where he met and reconnected with the four Avatars preceding him.[45] While he succeeded in healing the Avatar Spirit, his physical injuries prevented him from accessing the Avatar State and connecting with his past lives. As his body healed, he managed to reconnect with them,[9][22] though it was only when Ozai violently shoved him against a protruding rock, which unleashed the energy block in his back, that the connection was fully restored.[10] Later, however, feeling that Roku's advice about the state of the world was no longer relevant, Aang deliberately severed his connection to his past self. This caused an unintentional severing of his connection to all his past lives before Roku, except in certain situations, such as special rituals.[63] Later, Aang was able to restore his connection to Roku and all the past Avatars by recrafting the fire pendant on his meditation beads.[64]\n\nMedium\n\nAang connecting with Hei Bai\nAang used his affinity with the spirits to connect with Hei Bai and calm down the forest spirit.\nAs the carrier of the Avatar Spirit, Aang also had the capacity to act as a medium, a bridge between the mortal world and the Spirit World.[25][103] Even while still a young child, Aang demonstrated a natural affinity to the spiritual arts. Through meditation, Aang could separate from his body and travel to the Spirit World and, with the help of a spirit, his astral form could also visit the physical world's astral plane.[1][25] Once in the Spirit World, Aang could travel freely and communicate with beings such as Koh the Face Stealer.[1] This position as an intermediary also allowed him to connect with other spirits while in the Avatar State; he combined with the Ocean Spirit to defeat the Fire Nation during the Siege of the North,[28] and had also channeled his past lives, namely Roku[26] and Kyoshi.[104]\n\nChi sensing\n\nUsing his chakra with the roots around him, Aang eventually became deeply connected to other individuals and located them. He used this ability to find Appa and Momo in the Foggy Swamp.\n\nAgility\n\nHide and Aang\nAang employed evasiveness in his fighting style, which complemented his airbending in his spar with Hide.\nAang was extremely agile and quick even without bending, proven while forced to hide his bending abilities when masquerading as a Fire Nation student. He was able to defend himself without needing to resort to bending by simply dodging and avoiding attacks. This technique was first shown in Aang's fight against the student Hide in the Fire Nation school. Aang effortlessly defeated him without ever striking him, instead simply dodging his blows and pushing him when he was off-balance.[48] He repeated this feat at Yu Dao against a group of firebending soldiers, dodging and evading their fire blasts with a variety of acrobatic moves and without resorting to any of his bending arts and at the end only having his clothes slightly charred.[19] This fighting style was overall similar to the martial art Baguazhang, which consists of an intricate set of foot and palm movements to dodge, walk circles around the enemy, and strike unexpectedly as well as defend from all angles; this art emphasized the pursuit of harmony in conflict situations, rather than destroying or defeating the opponent, an idea he was raised upon due to the pacifistic demeanor of the Air Nomads.\n\nOther skills\n\nAang could use his glider staff with great skill as well, using it as a method of transport and sometimes for attack, defense, or bending.[100]\n\nAside from his combat skills, Aang displayed an impressive degree of artistic talent on a few occasions. He was an extremely talented and agile dancer, being able to perform somersaults in mid-air, among other acrobatic feats, and coordinate with Katara in a dance. His somersaults at that time did not seem to be aided by airbending, as he was in a public area surrounded by Fire Nation students, and there was no sign of any air currents around him. Aang also displayed a degree of musical talent, as he was able to play an airbender's flute well enough for the Official Avatar Aang Fan Club to revel in his performance.[19] He was also able to play the tsungi horn, although he was self-admittedly terrible at it"

DON'T YOU TWO DUNDERHEADS EVER FORGET IT!\n\nToph Beifong was an earthbending master, one of the most powerful of her time, and the discoverer of metalbending. Blind since birth, Toph was constantly treated condescendingly because of her visual impairment, particularly by her overprotective parents, Lao and Poppy Beifong. Upon discovering badgermoles, earthbending animals who are also blind, she learned how to use earthbending as an extension of her senses. This gave her the ability to \"see\" every vibration that passes through the ground.[17]\n\nHaving developed her own unique style of earthbending, Toph acquired a toughened personality and became famous for winning underground earthbending tournaments under the alias \"The Blind Bandit\", doing so behind her parents' backs.[9] Although initially uninterested in directly aiding the war effort, she eventually chose to leave behind her old life, and travel with Avatar Aang and his friends as his earthbending teacher, when her parents finally became unbearable for her.[8] Toph's total mastery over earthbending, unique personality, and thoughtful pragmatism made her a valuable addition to the team.\n\nAfter Republic City's formation, Toph became the city's first Chief of Police, forming the Metalbending Police Force to help maintain order.[18] She had two daughters with two different men: Lin, who succeeded her as Chief of Police, and Suyin, who created the metal city of Zaofu. Toph eventually set out to roam the world in search of enlightenment[19] before settling down in the Foggy Swamp.[20]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the significance of Toph Beifong in the Avatar series? toggle section\nHow did Toph Beifong discover metalbending? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Aang and Toph? toggle section\nHow does Toph's blindness affect her earthbending abilities? toggle section\nWho are Toph Beifong's parents and how did they treat her? toggle section\n\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nToph befriends a badgermole\nToph first learned how to earthbend from badgermoles when she was five years old.\nToph was born in 88 AG as the only child of the wealthy Beifong family from Gaoling. Born blind, she was sheltered by her parents, who believed her blindness made her fragile and incapable of looking after herself. They went to extreme measures to protect her, including hiding her existence from the rest of the world, which resulted in very few people knowing that the Beifong family even had a daughter. Her parents expected their daughter to be well-mannered and proper due to their noble status in Earth Kingdom society, something with which Toph secretly disagreed, causing her to resent her parents' treatment.[8]\n\nOne day when she was five years old,[21][22] Toph ran away from home and hid in a cave inhabited by badgermoles. Badgermoles were the first earthbenders and according to Toph, she felt that she and the creatures understood each other as they were both blind. She learned earthbending by imitating their movements.[17] In this way, she learned to \"see\" through the use of her earthbending, detecting people and other objects through their vibrations, which she sensed through the ground via her bare feet.[8] Her blindness and patience helped her to develop a keen sense of hearing. Toph would continue to sporadically run away from home to find refuge in the Foggy Swamp due to its close proximity to her hometown.[23][24]\n\nLao Beifong later hired the earthbender teacher, Master Yu, to instruct her. Acting upon the orders of Toph's father, he did not teach her anything other than beginner's moves, unaware that she had already achieved mastery in the art. She became such a formidable bender that she secretly entered underground earthbending tournaments as the Blind Bandit, and was successful to the point where she became the champion of Earth Rumble more than once. After meeting Aang when she was 12 years old, Toph soon ran away in order to teach him earthbending, but also to escape her parents, who never granted her any real freedom.[8]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (Spring 100 AG)\nToph teaches Aang\nToph began to teach Aang earthbending.\nAfter joining Team Avatar, Toph quarreled with Katara over her participation in the team, which, along with the additional stress of being chased by Azula and her team, led to Toph leaving the group. However, after talking to Iroh, Toph changed her mind and rejoined her friends in Tu Zin.[25] After the encounter, Toph began her earthbending lessons with Aang. Although Aang initially struggled with Toph's training methods, he learned to adopt an earthbender-like approach to battle situations and started to bend the element.[26] Soon after, Team Avatar was split up during a Fire Nation ambush. Toph, Aang, and Sokka captured a Fire Nation soldier while searching for Katara, and were eventually reunited with her through the aid of Jiang's pirates.[27]\n\nAs Aang continued his bending training with Toph and Katara, the group ventured into the middle of the Si Wong Desert with Professor Zei in hope of learning information to use against the Fire Nation. Although they managed to find Wan Shi Tong's library, Toph chose to stay outside, as she could not read. When the structure began to sink, Toph chose to hold up the library even as Si Wong tribesmen arrived on the scene and kidnapped Appa.[28] After making their way out of the desert, Team Avatar's new goal was to inform the Earth King about an eclipse in the Fire Nation that Sokka had discovered in the library.[29] The team chose to make their way to Ba Sing Se via the dangerous Serpent's Pass, which the group successfully managed to do in spite of numerous setbacks.[3]\n\nAlthough they arrived at the walls of the capital, Toph and the team first helped to thwart an invasion plan by destroying the Fire Nation drill.[30] The group found it difficult to meet with King Kuei once settling in the city, but Toph helped the rest of the team sneak into a party at the palace, where they were discovered and dismissed by Long Feng.[4] As the team continued their search for Appa and waited to meet with the government, they managed to rest for a while, though eventually found that Appa was in the clutches of the Dai Li.[31][32] Team Avatar managed to subdue the Dai Li and convinced the Earth King to regain power and imprison Long Feng, beginning their plans to invade the Fire Nation with the help of the Council of Five. With things looking better for the team, Toph received a letter claiming that her mother was in the city and that she finally understood her daughter, but when going to meet her, Toph was kidnapped by Xin Fu and Master Yu, who began to take her back to Gaoling in a metal cage pulled by an ostrich horse-drawn cart.[2]\n\nDiscovering metalbending\nToph discovered metalbending while trapped in a cage.\nAfter some time in her cage, Toph began to bash her hands against the metal walls using seismic sense. The vibrations allowed her to see the fragments of earth within metal. Reaching out for the fragments and widening her stance, Toph bent metal for the first time in the history of earthbending. After freeing herself from the cage, she trapped Xin Fu and Yu inside and hurried back to Ba Sing Se on a wave of earth, until she was picked up by Aang and Sokka on Appa.[1][33] Returning to the palace, Toph and the group were caught off-guard by Azula and her team, who had masqueraded as Kyoshi Warriors and begun to orchestrate a palace coup with the aid of the Dai Li. Toph easily broke herself, Sokka and King Kuei free from imprisonment with metalbending, but escaped Ba Sing Se with a grievously wounded Aang on Appa after the city fell to the Fire Nation.[33]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (Summer 100 AG)\nAfter fleeing Ba Sing Se, Team Avatar commandeered a Fire Nation ship, sailing toward the Fire Nation as Aang slumbered. Shortly after he awoke, they met another Fire Nation ship, and Toph aided in the ensuing battle with her metalbending.[34] Team Avatar split from their allies and went undercover as Fire Nation citizens in order to prepare for the invasion.[35] Eventually, the team began to be pursued by a mysterious assassin with the ability to combustionbend.[36]\n\nToph scamming\nToph used her bending abilities to scam people during Team Avatar's stay in Fire Fountain City.\nAs the team's resources began to run low, Toph decided to earn money for the group by cheating at carnival games in Fire Fountain City using earthbending and metalbending. Toph began to earn a reputation as a scam artist called \"The Runaway.\" This caused a rift to grow between Toph and Katara again, but the two soon made up, with Katara proposing that they run an even bigger scam by turning in Toph, collecting the bounty, and her metalbending herself out of jail. However, this was a trap set by Combustion Man and both of them were imprisoned. Katara freed the pair from the prison by bending her own sweat to cut the wooden cell, and the group fled the city after stunning Combustion Man. Toph also admitted her guilt about her parents and sent a message to them using Hawky.[5]\n\nWhen the Day of Black Sun arrived, Toph served as an earthbending soldier during the invasion. Toph battled against Fire Nation soldiers in the harbor until Aang told them that Caldera City was abandoned.[37][38] Toph sensed an underground bunker beneath the capital and searched for the Fire Lord with Aang and Sokka, but the group only found Azula, who taunted Sokka. With the eclipse having passed, the invasion force retreated, with Team Avatar and their younger allies heading to the Western Air Temple.[38][39]\n\nSoon after settling at the temple, Toph sensed that Zuko had arrived. The prince told them that he had changed and now wished to teach Aang firebending. All but Toph rejected him, as she could sense his sincerity with her truth-seeing. When Toph approached Zuko at his camp alone, he accidentally burned her feet, and she spent the rest of the night traveling back to the temple. Though the group seemed to be further turned against Zuko, they welcomed him to the team after he proved himself by helping to kill Combustion Man.[39] Toph provided useful advice to Aang and Zuko in trying to find the dragons to learn firebending, though she along with the rest of the group fled the temple after it was attacked by Azula following Hakoda and Suki's rescue from the Boiling Rock.[17][40][41]\n\nToph in metal armor\nToph assaulted a Fire Nation airship during Sozin's Comet using advanced metalbending abilities.\nThe group settled on Ember Island following the attack, where Toph expressed admiration of a bizarre portrayal of herself in a play retelling their adventures.[42] However, the group's anticipated chance to recuperate was interrupted when Zuko informed them of the necessity to attack the Fire Nation before it had a chance to burn the Earth Kingdom to ash during Sozin's Comet. Toph helped the team prepare for the assault on Ozai in a mock battle where she played the Fire Lord, but the preparations were halted when Aang mysteriously disappeared the following night.[7] Unable to find Aang, the group traveled to the Earth Kingdom so June could locate the Avatar, but to no avail. Instead, June brought the group to Iroh and the rest of the Order of the White Lotus. As part of the battle plans, Toph, Sokka, and Suki went to intercept the Fire Nation fleet of airships.[43] Toph propelled them all aboard the ships with earthbending just as they took off, and promptly used metalbending to incapacitate the soldiers and captain. Sokka steered their ship into the others, but their own ship began to break apart and they were separated from Suki.[44] Just as Toph and Sokka were about to fall from the ship, they were saved by Suki who was piloting another. As the comet departed, the group met up with Aang, who had stripped Ozai of his bending powers, congratulating him and taunting the former Fire Lord. After Zuko's coronation, Toph joined the rest of their team and their allies at the Jasmine Dragon in Ba Sing Se, where they celebrated their hard-won victory.[45]\n\n100 - 102 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (100 AG - 102 AG)\nToph and Suki fighting at Yu Dao\nToph and Suki fought Fire Nation troops during the battle for Yu Dao.\nFollowing the war's conclusion, Toph began to notice that her bracelet would shiver slightly when others around her got emotional. Toph speculated that these people were potential metalbenders, and founded a metalbending academy in Yu Dao, with her first three students being Penga, The Dark One, and Ho Tun.[46][47] Toph welcomed the other members of Team Avatar to the city while its political status was disputed during the Harmony Restoration Movement. As a teacher, Toph felt the effects of the conflict when Master Kunyo claimed ownership of the academy, as it had once been his firebending dojo. On the day of the battle for Yu Dao, Toph intended to surrender, but changed her mind when her students finally displayed tenacity, and began to metalbend for the first time. Toph participated in the battle by bending underground slides beneath tanks and disabled the vehicles.[48] After peace was made in Yu Dao, many more students enroled at the academy, and she declined an invitation to come to the Fire Nation with the rest of Team Avatar due to her workload.[49]\n\nToph holding back the cave-in\nToph saved everyone still trapped in the collapsed mine with her metalbending skills.\nToph attended a banquet in celebration of Yu Dao's new coalition government roughly one year later. She unenthusiastically joined Aang on a trip to the Yue Bay area, where Team Avatar and the Air Acolytes recreating Yangchen's Festival. Toph spurned many of the traditions, as they reminded her of her strict upbringing. When the group reached an industrial town, Toph quickly befriended a young industrialist, Satoru. Though Aang was disheartened to see the polluted environment, Toph opined that the Earthen Fire Refinery was a symbol of international cooperation, similar to Yu Dao. However, Toph was shocked to find that her father was one of the refinery's co-owners.[50] Lao did not admit that Toph was his daughter, and ordered the Rough Rhinos to escort her off the premises, angering Toph, who wished to speak with her father. Toph managed to gain access to the factory grounds, where Lao disavowed with kinship with Toph, and did not react to any of her accomplishments. When Sokka alerted them of the unstable iron mine, Toph stopped the surroundings from crushing her, Katara, and her father and his co-workers.[51] Toph strained herself by keeping up the debris for an unbearably long amount of time, until her students and Aang arrived to help. After being freed from the mine, Toph collapsed in her father's arms. After she learned that Aang intended on destroying the factory, Toph tried to dissuade him, telling him that he was doing so for no reason, but her efforts were cut short by the appearance of General Old Iron. After Aang battled the spirit, Toph thanked him for saving her students and choosing not to destroy the refinery. Her relationship with her father was slowly being mended, and three months later, she helped oversee Satoru's work in the refinery.[52]\n\nToph is bored\nToph expressed her boredom at her academy due to the monotonous routine.\nAfter the growth of Earthen Fire Industries, the academy had enough funding to build new facilities, and Toph's first three students were skilled enough to teach beginner's classes. In spite of her success, Toph began to grow bored of the monotony of daily life. After Sokka and Suki arrived to take her to see Chong and Trustfully in Love, Toph sought out an underground bending battle in an abandoned warehouse in Yu Dao. She discovered a lavabender named Sun, and helped support the warehouse after it was damaged by his lava. Toph invited Sun to join the academy and teach him how to master his element, and found her passion for teaching once again.[6]\n\nTeam Beifong help with the Southern Reconstruction Project\nToph and her students helped with the Southern Reconstruction Project.\nToph was later sent to the Southern Water Tribe as a representative of Earthen Fire Industries to aid in the Southern Reconstruction Project, though soon found herself in the midst of conflict once more when Gilak and his soldiers attacked a festival, with Toph and Sokka battling the Southern nationalists.[53] The next morning, Toph and her initial three students began work on Maliq and Malina's factory. During an international conference at Hakoda's office, Earth King Kuei was kidnapped by the Southern nationalists. Toph participated in the skirmish at the Bridge of No Return, wearing heavy armor to counter Thod's chi-blocking. After the fight, Toph and the rest of Team Avatar enjoyed a meal at Kanna and Pakku's house.[54]\n\nToph proposes taking Liling's bending away\nToph proposed that Aang take Liling's bending away.\nLater, Team Avatar made their way to Yu Dao, but Toph convinced Aang to stop by Earthen Fire Industries, so that she could meet with her father. To their surprise, the small town around the refinery had grown into a small city called Cranefish Town. They soon found that the fast-growing city was suffering from bending gangs, and an increasing social divide between benders and nonbenders. The same problem had occurred at the factory, as several bender workers were let go to keep costs down.[55] After an explosion at the factory, Toph began to suspect Councilwoman Liling, having heard the footsteps of her daughters, Ru and Yaling. Toph offered to teach Yaling metalbending, but her true goal was to coax her into revealing more information. Through Yaling, Toph gained the password to a bender supremacist rally, where she confronted and attempted to arrest Liling. Liling was captured after a skirmish with Team Avatar, and Toph proposed that Aang take her bending away, to the shock of the others. After Liling managed to escape, Toph battled her bender supremacist forces. Though Yaling managed to knock Toph to the ground, Sokka managed to defeat her. Three days later, Toph walked through the city, and along with the rest of Team Avatar, resolved to stay in Cranefish Town and help it prosper into a city later known as Republic City.[56]\n\nWorking as Chief of Police\n\nOlder Toph Beifong\nToph became Chief of Police in Republic City.\nAfter the formation of Republic City, Toph was placed at the head of its law enforcement and became the city's first Chief of Police.[18] Her metalbending knowledge allowed her to found an elite team, the Metalbending Police Force, to aid her in her duties.\n\nSometime before 120 AG, Toph met Kanto, with whom she had a daughter, Lin. The relationship did not work out, however, and six years later, she had another daughter, Suyin, with another man, though she ended up raising them as a single parent. Both daughters inherited her earthbending abilities and became masters in their own right. Seeking to give them a different childhood than the one she had, Toph gave her daughters the freedom to find their own path. Lin would later follow in her footsteps as the Chief of Police, while Suyin became a rebel, much like her mother when she was young. Toph told her daughters she considered them a blessing; though Lin thought she was lying.[19] In 124 AG, Toph commissioned a friend to illustrate her first encounter with Aang during Earth Rumble VI to include in a book the latter was assembling for his son, Tenzin.[57]\n\nIn 128 AG, at age forty, Toph was on her way to arrest a man named Yakone for being a practitioner of the illegal art of bloodbending and using it to terrorize Republic City. Although mildly annoyed that Avatar Aang asked to accompany her, she let him join her, although she could not resist calling him by her childhood nickname for him, \"Twinkle Toes\", much to his annoyance.\n\nYakone bloodbending Toph\nChief Toph was bloodbent by Yakone to unlock his chains.\nHaving apprehended Yakone at Kwong's Cuisine, she brought him to be tried before the United Republic Council. However, right after he was found guilty of his crimes, Yakone used his bloodbending abilities to incapacitate Sokka. Coming to the aid of her friend, Toph was immobilized by the illegal bending art as well and was forced to use her keys to free Yakone of his handcuffs before being harshly tossed aside and incapacitated.[58]\n\nIn the mid 130s AG, Tenzin was brought to her office with a pair of vandals that the police had arrested for fighting one another at the docks. Tenzin explained that the criminals had been defacing airbending gates with graffiti, but Toph explained that he shouldn't have dealt vigilante justice, but should have reported the crime instead. When Aang arrived to collect Tenzin, she told him she was letting him off with a warning, while the two vandals would spend the night in jail. Aang offered to deal with the criminals in the style of the Air Nomads, as the only damaged property was in his jurisdiction on Air Temple Island. Toph begrudgingly accepted, though rhetorically asked why Aang liked undermining her authority, which he joked was part of their complicated friendship.[59]\n\nIn 142 AG,[60] after Lin caught Suyin trying to flee from an arrest for theft, the sisters were brought into Toph's office. Knowing the scandal that would erupt from the Chief of Police having a daughter in prison, as well as wanting to protect her, Toph destroyed Suyin's police report and sent her to live with her parents. She retired from the police force a year later. At the same time, Suyin would later travel the world, eventually building a metal city, Zaofu. Toph and Suyin later reconciled, though Lin refused to participate.[14] Toph would visit Suyin in Zaofu from time to time, regaling her granddaughter, Opal, with stories about Lin, until she left to travel around the world in search of enlightenment. According to Aiwei, she was not seen since.[19]\n\n174 AG\n\nMain article: History of Toph Beifong (174 AG)\nToph helping Korra\nToph helped Korra to realize that she needed to let go of her fear of her past enemies if she wanted to be ready to face future threats.\nAfter many years living in the Foggy Swamp, Toph found Korra passed out in the mud. She brought Korra back to her home, introducing herself as a good friend of Korra's previous life, to the astonishment of the Avatar.[20] Toph helped Korra recover from her weakened physical state, and when the pair sparred, Toph easily won. Toph was the first person to notice that Korra still had remnants of mercury in her body. Although she tried to extract the poison from Korra, the Avatar resisted Toph's bending and refused to relax. Growing frustrated, Toph told Korra that she would have to get the metal out of her body herself.[61] Days later, the earthbender sent Korra to fetch some mushrooms for her, hoping that the swamp would give her visions. When Korra returned, explaining that she had seen her old enemies, Toph told her that the swamp wanted her to learn from them, and explained how all of her previous adversaries had noble intentions, but the problem was that they had been out of balance. After Korra still seemed reluctant to face her fears, Toph frustratedly guided Korra to the banyan-grove tree, explaining that their roots were connected to the entire swamp. Korra successfully tapped into the connection of the swamp and received a vision of Jinora, Ikki, and Meelo coming for her, with Toph greeting Aang's grandchildren after they arrived. All of them returned to Toph's home, and she instructed Korra to clear her mind and find the metal. Guiding Korra through a painful vision, Toph saw the Avatar successfully bend the residual mercury out of her system and complimented her on the achievement. After finally allowing Korra to embrace her, she saw off the Avatar and Tenzin's children, glad to live in peace and quiet once again.[62]\n\nToph and Lin reconciling\nBoth apologizing for their mistakes, Toph and Lin reconciled.\nToph later learned of Suyin and most of her immediate family being imprisoned following the Fall of Zaofu via the vines in the swamp, and traveled to the city to help rescue them. Though Suyin had been moved to a secure location, she made herself known to Lin, Opal, and Bolin, who had come with the same intentions. The team traveled to a nearby factory and reeducation facility in hopes of rescuing the family, with Lin acting extremely abrasive on the way. After discovering the facility, the group camped for the night, with a confrontation erupting between mother and daughter when Toph began to talk about Lin's father for the first time in her daughter's life. The following day, Toph, Lin, and Bolin tunneled down to the cavern where Suyin's family was being held during a demonstration of Kuvira's spirit energy cannon. Toph and Bolin catapulted Lin on top of the family's wooden cage, and swung them toward Bolin with her metal cable. Although the family had been saved, Baatar's screams alerted the guards of their presence. Toph helped fight off the Earth Empire soldiers, and insulted Kuvira before escaping to safety on Juicy. The family parted in a bamboo forest, with Toph apologizing for the problems in Lin and Suyin's upbringing and her leaving on much better terms with her eldest daughter. She declined Opal's request to return to Republic City, explaining that her fighting days were over and that it was time for the next generation.[63]\n\nThree months after Kuvira's surrender, Toph was visited by Korra and Earth King Wu, who asked her to run as governor of the State of Gaoling in order to oppose Commander Guan of the Earth Empire, who threatened to jeopardize the democratic movement. Toph initially refused, but was convinced to join when Wu explained his visions of his late great-aunt, urging her to step outside her comfort zone. She traveled to Gaoling as a candidate, though recognized that the populace had largely been brainwashed. As the Earth Empire tried to apprehend the group, Toph and the others escaped on a Metal Clan airship that a temporarily released Kuvira had radioed from Zaofu, battling the soldiers for as long as it took to retrieve Asami.[15] At Zaofu, Toph learned that she had lost the election, as King Wu had been brainwashed into moving up the election date, with the Earth Empire threatening to resurface. After Kuvira stole a plane and headed to Zaofu, Toph joined Korra and her friends in flying to Gaoling on Juicy, engaging in battle with Guan's forces. After the situation was resolved, the Earth King tried to convince Toph to run in the next election, but she refused, explaining that she would return to the swamp, as she deemed the predators there to be more honest than politicians.[64]\n\nAlthough Toph liked to stay in the swamp, she still made occasional visits to Republic City in order to spend more time with Opal. This also meant that she was able to reunite with Katara, and Toph and Katara brought their families to the beach with Korra, Asami, and Bolin. Toph and Katara began to reminisce about their long history of pranking each other, and had fun starting a prank war between everyone at the beach.[65] Before returning to the swamp, Toph wanted to take one last trip to important places in the world, including Jasmine Island, which Iroh had told her about. She decided on a whim to venture to the island to pay respects to Iroh and Lu Ten, and to sample its delicious tea.[66]\n\nLegacy\n\nToph was hailed as a hero in Republic City following her retirement and a metal statue of her in her police uniform was placed in a niche above the main entrance of the police headquarters. Among her many accomplishments, including introducing metalbending to the world, both as a prodigy and as a teacher, she founded Republic City's metalbending police unit and won them a reputation for professionalism and training the equal of any across the four nation.[67] Several statues of Toph were also built in Zaofu in honor of her discovery of metalbending.[14]\n\nPersonality\n\nToph annoyed\nToph was comfortable with letting those around her know when she was displeased.\nDue to her blindness, Toph was often pampered by her overprotective parents. Her freedom was limited to the point where her own existence was not known to most people in her hometown, much to her chagrin, thus straining her relationship with her parents. As a result, she greatly craved to interact with the rest of the world, albeit independently. It was not until she learned earthbending from the badgermoles that her confidence tremendously increased. As a result, she secretly participated in Earth Rumble tournaments without her parent's knowledge.[8]\n\nUpon joining Team Avatar, Toph brought a completely new personality to the group. Unlike the nurturing Katara, flighty Aang, or gruff but goofy Sokka, Toph was fiercely independent, sarcastic, direct, stubborn, and confrontational.[25] She appeared to have the same carefree and adventurous personality as Aang and was very tomboyish in the way she acted[25] and dressed,[31] in contrast to the delicate doll her parents saw her as. Toph loved battling and took great pride in her earthbending skills. She appeared eager to prove that she was as strong as anyone who could see and once claimed that she was \"the greatest earthbender in the world\".[1] This attitude was most prominently shown when she was teaching Aang earthbending, as she taught him to face his enemies and problems head-on.\n\nToph's eagerness to prove that she could be independent led to some initial difficulties with Aang and his friends. Toph insisted that she could \"carry her own weight\" and often mistook a simple friendly gesture as an act of pity for her blindness. Her encounter with Iroh, however, taught her that Aang, Katara, and Sokka cared for her because they were friends, not because her blindness made them feel obligated to do so.[25]\n\nToph was often brutally honest when criticizing others, especially her friends. She was vocal about her opinions on others regardless of status (the Avatar, Aang) or age (Iroh).[25] Her occasional attitude or aloofness is likely related to her being the only child of one of the richest families in the Earth Kingdom. Due to her time as a competitor and champion of earthbending tournaments, she was an expert in verbally taunting and insulting her opponents and, on occasion, her friends, particularly Sokka. She revealed to Katara that, being unable to see what she looks like, she did not feel the need to fuss over her appearance.[31] However, despite her many quirks, Toph showed that she was a quick learner,[7] and her courage and loyalty to her new friends seemed very stable.\n\nToph and Katara seemed to be polar opposites; while Katara was kind, welcoming and supportive, Toph was rough, unyielding and steadfast. These differences in personality extended to the way both girls taught Aang; however, Toph eventually showed a bit of compromise in order to help Aang through his initial difficulty with earthbending.[26] Despite occasional clashes or spats,[5] Toph and Katara generally got along.\n\nToph spits\nWhile raised in a wealthy and prominent Earth Kingdom family, Toph deliberately lacked manners as a form of rebellion.\nOne of Toph's most profound traits involved personal hygiene. She was accustomed to lying on the ground and walking everywhere barefoot leaving her soles soiled, a habit common among the earthbenders. Also, she had been seen belching loudly, picking her nose or toes,[68] spitting, and was usually covered in dirt or, as she called it, \"a healthy coating of earth\".[31]\n\nToph was well-educated in the manners and bearings of high society but deliberately chose to ignore them. However, she made an exception when the group needed to go to an exclusive party to see the Earth King in order to give news of the solar eclipse. To this end, she and Katara dressed and acted formally to evade suspicion.[4]\n\nToph did not let her blindness hurt her self-confidence. She had high self-esteem in regard to many of her abilities and was more than determined to show that she would not let her blindness deter her from living freely and fighting like everyone else. However, sometimes this acted as a ruse to hide personal insecurities. After getting a makeover with Katara in Ba Sing Se, some residents of the city mocked Toph for it (who retaliated with a prank). She told Katara that \"one of the good things about being blind [was] that [she did] not have to waste [her] time worrying about appearances\" and was not looking for anyone's approval. Katara voiced that it was something she admired in Toph but could tell that she had been hurt by the insult and added that though it did not matter, she was in fact pretty, which visibly cheered up the blind girl.[31]\n\nToph's blindness\nA laid-back individual, Toph was fine with her blindness.\nAn ongoing joke concerning Toph's blindness was her lack of ability to discern anything that had been written or drawn. In Ba Sing Se, Toph became angry when Sokka suggested that she needed help distributing fliers. She angrily slapped up a poster herself, only to inadvertently place it backward and say, \"It's upside-down, isn't it?\" Also, she sarcastically complimented Sokka on his drawings of Appa despite the obvious fact that she could not see them.[32] Later, in the Fire Nation, after being presented with the same wanted poster twice, Toph vocally expressed her annoyance with the constant oversight.[5] Toph was comfortable enough, however, with the group's absent-mindedness on the subject of her blindness to even joke about it herself at times. For example, while searching for Wan Shi Tong's Library, Toph, while flying on Appa, claimed that she saw it, before remarking, \"That's what it'll sound like when one of you spots it\", and waving a hand in front of her eyes with a nonchalant smile.[28]\n\nWhile hijacking an airship, Toph mistook Sokka's comment about taking the wheel, thinking he was referring to her. By the smile on her face, it was pretty clear that she was gleeful about getting another chance to correct him. However, it turned out that Sokka was talking to Suki, and Toph managed to subsequently cover up her original intention pretty well.[44] At the reunion in the Jasmine Dragon after the passing of Sozin's Comet, she made a joke about Sokka's drawing, saying that she thought everyone looked perfect.[45]\n\nBecause of the restrictions placed upon her by her parents and the fact that their servants waited upon her hand-and-foot lest she hurt herself, Toph often seemed to want to take on the responsibilities and obtain the freedoms of adulthood. This caused problems for herself and her friends, most notably during their visit to Fire Fountain City, as she did not always take into account how this might endanger her or aggravate others. No matter how she acted, though, others realized that she was still a vulnerable child underneath everything else she pretended to be.[5]\n\nWhen she went on to teach her unique talent of metalbending, she realized how her dogged pursuit of her own dreams of becoming the world's first metalbending teacher disrespected who her students were. She found parallels between how she was treating them as people by restricting them simply so they could meet her vision of them with how her parents had treated her back when she still lived with them. She subsequently decided to give up her metalbending academy so that she would not use it as an outlet for the pain she felt from her relationship with her parents onto her students. Luckily for her, her students happened to have overheard her conversation with Sokka about this subject, and responded to it by overcoming the limits the rest of the world saw as defining them in an attempt to live up to the vision Toph had had for them, and were finally able to metalbend.[47]\n\nDue to her troubled past with her parents, Toph also exhibited a modernist attitude, believing that change is the key to progress.[50]\n\nAs a mother, Toph found herself to be a direct opposite of her parents, letting her daughters be free to find their own way, though Suyin claimed that Toph was not pleased with the paths either of her daughters had chosen. She later admitted to her children that, while she knew she had not been the best parent, she was proud of the women they had become.[63]\n\nIn old age, Toph retained her abrasive, no-nonsense personality, being harshly critical of Korra's abilities and enjoying defeating her in combat. However, she had adopted a more cynical mindset about the impact actions make on their surroundings; she had realized that no matter how hard she tried, crime and injustice would never give up.[61]\n\nDespite her tough exterior, Toph was not above warming up during intimate moments, as evidenced when she joined in group hugs with Team Avatar and held hands with Aang at the prospect of friendships lasting more than one lifetime.[69] Although she became more cynical in old age, she allowed herself to show affection when she deemed the other person worthy, as evidenced when she let Korra hug her after earning her respect[62] and did not berate or try to stop Opal's embrace when they met again after several years of separation.[63] She even allowed Wu to hug her after she gathered the King was just an affectionate person.[15]\nAbilities\n\nEarthbending\n\nEarth column\nWhen Toph joined Team Avatar, her earthbending capabilities made it obvious that she would be a promising asset for the team.\nToph's proclamation of being the most powerful earthbender in the world was supported by her talented displays of earthbending from a young age.[1] Although blind, Toph's training in earthbending under the original earthbenders, the badgermoles, allowed her to use their unique ability of seismic sense: she used earthbending to \"feel\" even the most minute vibrations in the earth, including the march of ants several meters away and the presence of trees and buildings.[8] Through this heightened seismic sense, Toph could visualize where people were, their relative distance to her, and their physical build, but was unable to visualize faces.[31] This sense provided her with a distinct advantage when facing other earthbenders in combat because she could predict attacks as they began and quickly react.[8] Her knowledge of the art also allowed her to teach it to others like Aang, and later her daughters, Lin and Suyin. Her speed and agility were also greatly beneficial in combat.\n\nHer earthbending style was unique and thus unpredictable, as her training was unconventional and more deeply rooted in the nature of earthbending rather than just pure fighting. This style greatly differentiated from the rigid training and fighting style that earthbenders like the Dai Li implemented. Toph's style tended to be proven to be superior to the Dai Li, as she was able to take on a number of them and defend her friends at the same time.[32] This is likely because while the Dai Li just manipulated the earth, Toph had established a tremendously deep connection to it at the very outset of her self-tutelage in earthbending (although both styles have an over-dependence on something i.e. the Dai Li and their earth gloves and Toph and her feet).\n\nHowever, because Toph was dependent on vibrations in the earth, she was vulnerable to air-based attacks, as shown in her fight with Aang in Earth Rumble VI. Later, Toph was completely surprised by Sokka dropping a large belt on her head.[8] Her success rate in intercepting non-earth projectiles was also tied to her sensing of vibrations, being able to feel an opponent's movement when they jump off the ground, and proceeding accordingly. By her own admission, she could not aim properly at opponents while they were airborne.[29] Despite this, her connection with earthbending was seemingly good enough that she was able to feel the earth even if it was not connected to the ground.[70]\n\nToph's seismic sense\nToph used her seismic sense to feel her surroundings and anticipate the motions and attacks of her enemy.\nTerrain that impaired Toph's ability to sense vibrations also hindered her abilities, as shown when Toph had some difficulty with sand, describing the vibrations in the earth as \"fuzzy\". She was able to compress sand into solid rock to gain some temporary footing, but she was still unable to accurately aim attacks under those conditions.[29] However, she seemed to have ultimately gained some mastery of sandbending, as she mentioned working on it during Team Avatar's beach party and was able to create a miniature version of the upper ring of Ba Sing Se in rich detail. Apparently, her ability to sense vibrations had improved, which may be how she was able to produce the very fine details of the city and did not show the same helplessness she had shown when previously walking on sand when the gang stepped onto the beach.[7] By 174 AG, Toph attained a state of enlightenment similar to Huu, being able to use the connections of the swamp she lived in with her seismic sense to survey the world and observe everyone, being able to \"see\" areas as far as Zaofu and Republic City.[62][61]\n\nToph also expressed an aversion for flying[2] and submarine travel,[37] as she could not sense her surroundings without her feet on solid ground. Also, as a result of her closeness or affinity with earth, Toph could rest or sleep comfortably on solid rock without any sleeping bag or blanket and could walk on any kind of terrain in bare feet, a standard trait for earthbenders. Toph relied on direct contact between her feet and the ground for \"sight\"[35] as well as for her earthbending. Toph was very reluctant to allow anyone else to touch her feet,[31] probably because insensitive handling there would make her deaf to other vibrations and thereby render her helpless (and because they were far more sensitive than other people's feet).\n\nDespite her substantial prowess on land, Toph did not perform well in water and on ice. She seemed incapable of seeing where she was going on ice, was not able to swim,[3] and became nauseous when she needed to travel by submarine in the invasion of the Fire Nation.[37]\n\nIn Ba Sing Se, Toph demonstrated an ability to sense even slight vibrations, informing a man they met that she could feel him shaking.[4] Toph was also able to sense when a person was lying by the vibrations of his/her heartbeat and breathing patterns.[32] However, Toph's ability to detect lies was not absolute, as Azula demonstrated when she was easily able to lie without even the slightest physical reaction.[38] However, very few people have the ability to lie while manipulating their breathing and pulse in this way.\n\nToph's earthbending style was based on Chu Gar Southern Praying Mantis, a style that was apparently unique to her; the style of earthbending used by other earthbenders is rooted in the Hung Gar style of Kung Fu. She was the only bender known to use a style based on a different root martial art than the standard for their bending art. This may be because she was self-taught rather than trained in the traditional earthbending form. Toph came to develop her unique style by observing the movements of the also blind earthbending badgermoles that could be found in the caves around her hometown.[17] By 174 AG, Toph's fighting style evolved to incorporate more fluid and evasive maneuvers, bending mud more akin to waterbending.[62]\n\nSandbending\n\nToph sandbending\nToph demonstrated to Aang her practice of sandbending.\nBecause sand is loose and ultimately always changing with the winds of the desert, Toph found it hard to navigate through and control. To compensate somewhat, she could condense the sand together to give her a better footing. However, when she tried to attack one of the sandbenders with a small wave of sand during their ambush of her and Appa, she missed, her lack of precision on the sand aggravated by her hurry to save both Appa and the others.\n\nAfter the events in the Si Wong Desert had shown her inability to see effectively while walking on sand,[29] Toph practiced her sandbending, eventually achieving a mastery over it that allowed her to create an extremely detailed sand version of Ba Sing Se during her time relaxing at Ember Island.[7]\n\nMetalbending\n\nMain article: Metalbending\nToph in metal armor\nA fluid earthbending master, Toph mastered metalbending to the level she could use it as systematically as earth itself.\nToph discovered the ability to bend metal in the spring of 100 AG. Metal is derived from ore, which is found in the earth. Guru Pathik explained to Aang that \"metal is just a part of earth that has been purified and refined\". Because of Toph's ability to feel the vibrations in earth, she was able to locate the impurities (the small fragments of earth) still found in most metals and manipulate them to \"bend\" the metal portion. By acquiring these metalbending abilities, Toph showed herself to be one of the most powerful and ingenious earthbenders in the world, being the only known earthbender to ever bend metal during the Hundred Year War, a feat that even Avatar Aang was unable to perform since the origin of earthbending.[1]\n\nWhen Sokka finished his training as a swordmaster, he gave Toph a small piece of meteorite, which, being composed of earth and metal, she could easily mold into a myriad of shapes,[68] subsequently transforming it into an arm bracelet which she would wear.\n\nShe originally used an underdeveloped form of metalbending and usually needed to have direct contact with the element to manipulate it at all, let alone skillfully. However, she continued to practice her metalbending and started to display a dexterous control over metal.\n\nIn Wulong Forest, when she was breaking into a Fire Nation airship, it was shown that her metalbending had improved greatly, as she created metal armor and manipulated the metallic structure of the room with far more ease than before, moving metal more fluidly. She was also able to crawl along the metal ceiling while completely covered in metal. Additionally, Toph could metalbend outside of her metal armor, even though she was already bending the armor in the first place.[44]\n\nA year later, Toph could bend metal that she was not in contact with, like when she demonstrated her ability to bend metal to Kunyo, who was trying to take over the metalbending school, by bending a metal weapon around his head. She later stated that as long as someone could see the metal, she could bend it, which she demonstrated when metalbending screws and bolts to unscrew the wheels of Fire Nation tanks.\n\nToph later taught this self-invented technique to many earthbenders, including her daughters. After the Hundred Year War, Toph further refined metalbending to the point of being able to start and lead a capable law enforcement group of metalbending police officers. Following Toph's retirement, Lin Beifong became the new Chief of Police, demonstrating her prodigious metalbending and leadership abilities. Despite all of her accomplishments in the development of metalbending, Toph never succeeded in bending pure metals such as platinum.[71] She was, however, able to sense even trace amounts of metal, unlike her daughters.[61] Her proficiency in metalbending was such that she could tear a hole in a metal wall and restore it to its previous state without a trace of it ever having been bent.[63]\n\nOther skills\n\nToph as Melon Lord\nToph pretended to be the Melon Lord.\nDespite her lack of actual sight, her remaining senses, primarily her sense of touch and hearing, were especially acute, allowing her to use her seismic sense to remarkable levels. With the latter sense, she once claimed herself that she \"never [forgot] a voice\". This was shown when the gang traveled through the Si Wong Desert, where they were confronted by a group of sandbenders and she almost immediately recognized one as one of the sandbenders that kidnapped Appa the day before.[29] Later in the summer, while the gang was on a captured Fire Nation ship, Hakoda and Bato seemingly deceived the captain of another ship, but the captain realized the ship as a captured one. Toph overheard the captain whispering to his troops to sink the ship and attacked.[34] While visiting a creepy village in the Fire Nation, Toph heard people screaming all the way from atop a mountain and everyone later deduced that that was where several prisoners were being held.[72]\n\nToph also showed a decent amount of artistic talent, as she was able to create a realistic replica of the city of Ba Sing Se with sandbending while Team Avatar stayed at Ember Island, contrasting with Sokka's poor sculpting abilities when he created a sand sculpture of Suki. Later in a training exercise involving all of the members of the team, she was able to create earthbending mannequins while acting as the \"Melon Lord\"[7] (who was, in reality, an inanimate mannequin made to resemble the Fire Lord, supported by a small earth column and clothed in Fire Nation robes).\n\nAs befits one who has mastered the use of neutral jing by waiting and listening to the earth, Toph had a great sense of hearing, able to clearly hear the most subtle of whispering from considerable distances and could recognize people by the sound of their voices. In the Si Wong Desert, Toph recognized the sandbender who stole Appa, remarking as she did so that she never forgets a voice.[29] She likewise has very fine memory, able to accurately remember and distinguish the physical form of people as she quickly determined one of the Kyoshi Warriors was actually Ty Lee in disguise.[33]\n\nShe also seemed to enjoy acting and showed a decent amount of talent at it, getting more into character as the \"Melon Lord\" than was necessary for Team Avatar's training purposes,[7] rebuffing Katara for acting out of character when Aang distracted her from their act of being noblewomen (as was made necessary for entry into the Earth King's party[4]), and reveling in the \"stage name\" given to her as \"The Runaway\".[5] This appreciation for \"getting into character\" as an actor was likely behind her greater ability to enjoy the The Boy in the Iceberg play relative to the rest of Team Avatar.[42]\n\nShe also displayed a remarkable amount of agility for one who preferred to have her feet planted on the ground at all times. In Team Avatar's first battle with Combustion Man, she rolled, pushed herself off of the ground with one hand and flipped over in the air to regain her balance after his first shot. She positioned herself in an earthbending stance in order to fight back against her attacker as quickly as possible.[36] Toph apparently also had a good enough sense of balance and strong enough neck muscles to carry a basket full of groceries on her head"

EVEN YOU FEAR ME.\n\nAzula was a princess of the Fire Nation, daughter of Fire Lord Ozai and Ursa, younger sister of Zuko, and older half-sister of Kiyi. She was a key adversary of Team Avatar,[7] chasing Avatar Aang and her banished brother far across the Earth Kingdom accompanied by her then two best friends, Mai and Ty Lee.\n\nA firebending prodigy, Azula was manipulative and obsessed with power. She was a skilled strategist who orchestrated the coup of the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se,[8][9] and halted the invasion on the Day of Black Sun.[10]\n\nAzula harbored deep mental instabilities, believing her mother loved Zuko more than her.[11] Raised by her father in an environment without a mother-figure, Azula had to be nothing less than perfect in her father's eyes in order to gain affection and attention from him. After the betrayal of her two closest friends Mai and Ty Lee, these instabilities were brought up to the surface.[1] Upon the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Azula was soon to be crowned Fire Lord;[12] however, her defeat at the hands of her brother Zuko and Katara caused her to suffer a complete mental breakdown.[13]\n\nFollowing her emotional breakdown, Azula was put in a mental health facility to recover,[14] though she eventually joined Team Avatar on their search for Ursa, as part of her secret agenda to betray them and usurp the throne from Zuko.[15] At this quest's completion, however, Azula escaped the team's supervision.[16]\n\nSometime after her exile, Azula returned to the Fire Nation Capital in secret. Having finally accepted that she would never be Fire Lord, Azula resorted to manipulating Zuko so that she could rule through him. Gathering a group of female supporters, she took on the guise of the mythical Kemurikage to intimidate Ukano into threatening Zuko.[17] When that failed, Azula and her followers resorted to kidnapping children in the capital, setting the city into civil unrest.[18] Though Zuko and his allies were able to rescue the children, Azula and her followers escaped.[19] Her supporters eventually became disillusioned with her leadership and willingness to abandon them following a failed mission, leaving Azula on her own again.[20]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWho are the parents of Azula in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Azula and Zuko? toggle section\nWho were Azula's two best friends in \"Avatar: The Last Airbender\"? toggle section\nWhat is Azula's role in Team Avatar's journey? toggle section\nHow does Azula's firebending skills compare to other characters in the series? toggle section\nHistory\n\n\nAD\nAdvertisement\nEarly life\n\nMain article: History of Azula (85 AG - 100 AG)\nPrincess Azula was born to Prince Ozai and Princess Ursa in 85 AG.[2] Azula grew up with all the riches, splendor, and privileges of royalty in the Fire Nation. Her sharp wits and the fact that she was a firebending prodigy gained her great attention and acclaim, which quickly made her Ozai's favorite child.[2] Her father began raising her as his true heir from an early stage, taking her into his confidence and educating her in politics. Azula later attended the Royal Fire Academy for Girls, where she met and befriended Mai and Ty Lee, two daughters of Fire Nation noblemen.[21] During her time at the Academy, Azula took advantage of her status as princess. She manipulated students for her own benefit as well as pitting them against one another to maintain control, including orchestrating an Agni Kai between Peijing and Hong to instill lessons of fear amongst the Academy girls.[22]\n\nYoung Azula and Zuko\nAzula smiled triumphantly at her shocked brother while he was reprimanded by Ozai.\nEven though Azula and Zuko had a decent relationship in their early years,[23] the siblings grew apart as they got older due to their parents' behavior. While Azula was clearly favored by Ozai, she felt that her mother loved Zuko much more than her, creating a rift of jealousy between her and Ursa and Zuko. As a result of this resentment as well as Ozai's influence, Azula became increasingly cruel and manipulative, often bullying Zuko and feeling happy over the latter's misery.[23][24] She also manipulated her friends Mai and Ty Lee.[24] As result of her growing tendency toward malice and a desire for perfection, Azula craved power to keep others close to her and avoid loneliness.[24][20]\n\nWhen she was ten, Azula's life greatly changed. Her cousin Lu Ten was killed in the Siege of Ba Sing Se, and Ozai subsequently attempted to convince Azula's grandfather Azulon to change the succession. Azula eavesdropped on their conversation, and thus learned that Azulon had orded Ozai to kill Zuko in retaliation for his scheming. The girl went on to gleefully warn her brother to flee the palace, though Ursa noticed their exchange and thus learnt of Azulon's order. Ursa subsequently murdered Azulon, allowing Ozai to take the throne and going into exile. At the time, Azula felt satisfaction over her father's rise to Fire Lord and Ursa's disappearance.[24][23] Without her mother's protection, however, Azula was molded by Ozai into the perfect weapon and heir, negatively impacting her mental health.[20]\n\nAgni Kai audience\nAzula sadistically relished in the sight of her father burning her brother's face during their Agni Kai.\nTwo years later, Azula was among those who watched Zuko's Agni Kai with his father. When Ozai burned her brother's face, she smiled smugly in triumph.[25] When Zuko was banished from the Fire Nation, Azula became Ozai's de facto heir. For the next three years, she would continue her relentless training in firebending, strategy, and combat until she refined herself enough to serve her father. By this time, her firebending advanced to the level where her fire was blue, and she could create lightning, thus increasing her overall bending power and intensity, making her a formidable opponent.[2][26] In early 100 AG, Ozai tasked Azula with capturing Zuko and Iroh, having deemed both traitors.[5]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Azula (Spring 100 AG)\nAzula was supplied with a Fire Nation royal sloop, which included a crew and sailed to Zuko and Iroh's last known location. As they approached the port, Azula addressed her crew, emphasizing that she would not tolerate any reluctance to carry out their mission, even if they were apprehending members of the royal family. Before dismissing her crew, Azula reveled in their sense of fear. The ship's captain approached her, explaining that the tides would not allow them to bring the ship in before nightfall. Annoyed by the news, Azula deftly let the man know that his life was at stake if he did not follow her orders.\n\nAzula found Zuko and Iroh in a village resort and invited them to the ship with the false promise of being accepted home with open arms. Her initial plan of luring back her two dissident family members was thwarted by her own ship's captain, who accidentally addressed Zuko and Iroh as prisoners. In the ensuing skirmish, Azula was thrown overboard, allowing her brother and uncle to escape.[26] In order to pursue the Avatar, Azula formed an elite team consisting of her childhood friends Ty Lee, recruited from a circus, and Mai, who was living in Omashu as the governor's daughter. Azula did not manage to capture Aang and his friends in Omashu, but nonetheless was able to crush the city's resistance and secure it for the Fire Nation, renaming the city New Ozai in her father's honor.[21] Azula continued to pursue the Avatar, Zuko, and Iroh for several weeks, making use of technological advancements such as the tank train, being able to find them and wound Iroh in Tu Zin before fleeing the scene.[27]\n\nAzula undercover\nTy Lee, Azula, and Mai disguised themselves as the Kyoshi Warriors, successfully infiltrated the Earth King's circle of trust, gained control of the Dai Li, and enacted the Coup of Ba Sing Se, thus almost granting the Fire Nation complete victory in the war.\nAfter her initial failure to breach the strong outer wall of Ba Sing Se with the Fire Nation drill,[28] Azula and her team encountered the Kyoshi Warriors led by Suki, who they swiftly defeated and took into custody.[29] Hoping that it would break her, Azula sent Suki to the Boiling Rock high-security prison.[30] Disguising themselves, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai entered Ba Sing Se and successfully plotted a conspiracy with the treacherous minister Long Feng.[8][31] She had the Dai Li arrest the Council of Five, the Earth King's highest-ranking generals, while she personally overthrew the sovereign. Sokka and Toph were arrested while attempting to warn Earth King Kuei against the plot, and Azula sent to a separate dungeon. Immediately afterward, Long Feng arrived on the scene and commanded the Dai Li to arrest Azula, attempting to double-cross her. Having prepared against a potential counter, Azula instead convinced the Dai Li to pledge loyalty to her. Realizing that he had been outplayed at his own game, the Grand Secretariat grudgingly surrendered. After taking control of the palace, Azula encountered Zuko in the Upper Ring and managed to convince him to join her in order to redeem his birthright as crown prince. During a battle with the Avatar in the Crystal Catacombs beneath the city, Azula mortally wounded Aang with a lightning strike just after he entered the Avatar State, leaving the Avatar presumed dead forever and the Earth Kingdom capital delivered into the hands of the Fire Nation.[9]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Azula (Summer 100 AG)\nAfter the fall of Ba Sing Se, Azula made arrangements for her friends, Zuko, and herself to return to the Fire Nation. Before leaving the Earth Kingdom capital, she passed her rulership over the city to one Joo Dee, whom she raised to the city's Supreme Bureaucratic Administrator.[32] She also brought back her uncle Iroh in chains, who would be imprisoned in the Capital City Prison complex for his treachery. Back home, both she and her brother were welcomed as war heroes and were greeted by crowds of their people. However, Azula doubted that the Avatar was truly dead and believed that Zuko was hiding something from her. As such, she informed her father that Zuko had killed the Avatar, which would set him up for greater dishonor should he be proven to be alive.[11]\n\nAzula traveled with her friends and Zuko to Ember Island for a brief vacation while the Fire Lord conferred with his advisers in private. Azula took advantage of this opportunity to experience life as a normal person for the very first time, choosing to keep conceal her identity as a princess. The vacation was one of the few moments of her life when Azula opened up and revealed her pain and resentment about her relationship with her mother.[11] She confessed her belief that her mother thought her a \"monster\", commenting that though Ursa was right, it still hurt. She also displayed a moment of connection with Zuko when he left the group to visit their family's old summer home, following him and declaring the house \"depressing\" before inviting him back to the campfire. After returning to the capital, Azula attended an important all-day war meeting with her father, her brother, and the nation's most important generals, where she suggested using Sozin's Comet to destroy the Earth Kingdom once and for all, a plan which dismayed Zuko and would contribute to his eventual defection from their nation.[12][33]\n\nHaving gained knowledge of the invasion during her infiltration in the Earth Kingdom, Azula warned the Fire Lord in advance, and the royal family evacuated to an underground bunker prior to the invasion.[34] Azula and her agents stalled Aang, Sokka, and Toph from finding Fire Lord Ozai before the eclipse ended. This distraction allowed the Fire Army to retaliate with full force once their bending was reactivated, bringing the invasion to an end.[10]\n\nLater, Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee visited the the Boiling Rock, where Zuko had been captured while infiltrating the high-security prison in an attempt to rescue Hakoda. Although it seemed as if Zuko, Sokka, Suki, and Hakoda would fall into the boiling lake during an escape attempt, Mai helped aid their escape. Enraged, Azula confronted her former friend, who confessed that her love for Zuko was greater than her fear for Azula. At that moment, Azula prepared to attack Mai, but Ty Lee stopped her by blocking her chi. Azula subsequently had both Mai and Ty Lee imprisoned as traitors.[35] Afterward, Azula led a platoon of Fire Nation airships to the Western Air Temple, where she battled Zuko. During their skirmish, Azula nearly fell to her death after slipping from the airship, but was able to stop her descent by using her hairpin as an anchor in the cliff wall. Despite having failed to eliminate both Zuko and Aang, she smiled as the Avatar and his friends escaped the temple.[36]\n\nAzula fires lightning\nAzula firing lightning at Katara to gain an advantage during her Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai against Zuko.\nWhen Ozai departed to harness the power of Sozin's Comet to burn the Earth Kingdom, he named Azula as the new Fire Lord. Although Azula was astonished to receive the title, her father told her that while she would rule the homeland, he would become Phoenix King and become the supreme ruler of the world.[12] As she prepared for her coronation, Azula began to crack under the pressures of her friends' betrayal and accession to the throne, and her mental health began to deteriorate.[14][37] She became suspicious of her servants and began to banish them from the nation, along with her personal advisors Lo and Li, her own Dai Li agents, and the Royal Procession. While attempting to tie her hair for the coronation, Azula grew frustrated and grabbed a pair of scissors to cut her hair, resulting in it turning out uneven. Azula then saw a hallucination of her mother in the mirror. The vision of Ursa commented on Azula's penchant for using fear to control her friends, to which the princess replied that she had no choice, and that \"Trust is for fools. Fear is the only reliable way\". When Azula stated that Ursa feared her, the hallucination of her mother replied that she loved her instead. Azula began to cry and threw her hairbrush at the mirror in anger and distress.\n\nJust before the High Sage was to crown Azula as Fire Lord, Zuko and Katara arrived at the palace. Azula challenged Zuko to a Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai, to which he agreed, noticing her imbalanced mental state. During their fight, Azula's attacks were wild, emotional, and reckless, albeit still powerful, while Zuko's attacks were calm and controlled, and eventually, he gained the upper hand. When he began to overpower her, Azula, responding to his challenge to use lightning, directed her attack toward Katara. However, Zuko intercepted her attack and was grievously injured as a result.[1] Azula then attempted to attack Katara, but the waterbender trapped them both in ice and chained her to the floor by taking advantage of her mental decay. Seeing herself defeated and usurped as Fire Lord, Azula let out a fiery roar before breaking down, sobbing and screaming.[13]\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War\n\nSearching for Ursa\n\nInsane Azula\nAzula agreed to help Zuko extract information from Ozai.\nAfter her Agni Kai with Zuko and subsequent mental breakdown, Azula's insanity earned her Zuko's pity, and rather than being sent to prison, like their father Ozai was, she was committed to an asylum on a nearby island, where she was continuously monitored.[14] Although she considered the mental health facility a \"horrible\" experience, Azula actually befriended some other patients.[38] About a year later, she was visited by her brother, who told her that he had consulted with Ozai on several occasions in an attempt to learn Ursa's whereabouts, to no avail. Answering his request for help, Azula said that she needed nothing in return for her assistance, as the mere knowledge of being of service to the Fire Lord would be enough satisfaction. She also stated that she had been wondering as well what exactly happened to their mother following her disappearance six years earlier.[39]\n\nShe was placed in an adjoining cell with her father, though they did not speak with each other for half an hour. Zuko observed this and brought them tea in an attempt to make the situation more enjoyable. Azula grabbed hold of the tray with her teeth, however, causing Zuko to fall over. She angrily accused him of wanting to see her lap up the beverage like an animal since she would have had no other way to drink it while confined in her straitjacket. Her outburst prompted Ty Lee to chi-block her, rendering her completely immobile. Due to her poor mental health, Azula questioned the girl as to how \"she\", referring to Ursa, had managed to break the grasp of fear Azula used to have on her. Before the situation could escalate any further, Zuko intervened and stated that he had meant no harm and just wanted to ease the conversation with Ozai along. After being placed on her chair again, the chi-blocked Azula arrogantly stated that if her brother wanted her and their father to have a dignified conversation, he should leave them alone, which he did.[15]\n\nAzula burning Ursa's letters\nAzula burned Ursa's letters, much to Zuko's shock and horror.\nWhen Zuko was taking her back to her old quarters in the palace where she would be staying, he asked her whether or not she had been able to coax the needed information about Ursa's whereabouts from Ozai. She dodged the question and asked in return whether or not he had ever experienced the sensation of being chi-blocked. When Zuko said he had not, she proceeded to meticulously describe the feeling, mentioning that one becomes extremely flexible right before regaining their full control. To prove her words, she twisted her arm out of her straitjacket and fired a lightning bolt at her brother. In the ensuing skirmish, she managed to free herself entirely and made her way into a nearby building. Via a hidden passageway, she went to one of Ozai's secret chambers, where she retrieved a stack of undelivered letters, which Ursa had written to her hometown. Before Zuko could take them from her, she burned them, having already read them herself. She concealed one of them, however, as it contained information that suggested Zuko was not actually Ozai's son and thus had no claims to the throne. Unaware that Ursa wrote down false information because she knew the letter would be intercepted by Ozai, Azula kept it for leverage so she could eventually overthrow Zuko and let her brother believe that all had been destroyed. In return for knowledge about what had been written in the allegedly burned letter, she requested to be allowed to go with him on his search for their mother.[15]\n\nComplying with the request, Zuko released her from the mental institution and allowed her to accompany him, unbound and with dignity. When she showed herself to Team Avatar, however, she was immediately attacked by Katara. She easily dodged their attacks and proceeded to taunt and insult Sokka. It did not come to a scuffle until the next day when a short struggle ensued between her and Sokka. Azula disarmed him with a small, non-lethal lightning shock after he threatened her with his boomerang. The rest of the team immediately intervened and immobilized her with their bending. Upon her release, she haughtily stated that if they all just stayed away from her, they would get along perfectly.[15]\n\nUrsa loves Azula\nAzula was unable to cope with the fact that her mother loved her.\nShe traveled with Team Avatar on Appa to Hira'a to find her mother, but her mood was erratic, unpredictable, and characterized by delusions and hallucinations, as she constantly asked Team Avatar how \"she\" had contacted them, referring to her mother. Upon nearing Hira'a, she attempted to escape by jumping off of Appa. Aang swooped down and caught her in free fall, but she set his glider afire, causing him to crash to the ground and securing her getaway. She ran away but stopped as she neared a stream and heard her mother's voice coming from the water. She argued with the reflection, accusing Ursa of desiring to ruin her from the day she was born and heading a conspiracy to strip her of her power, of which she also claimed her mother had been jealous. However, she triumphantly stated that thanks to Ursa's letter, she now had all the proof she needed to take the throne from Zuko. She thus revealed her own plans to find and kill Ursa herself in order to stop her once and for all. She let out an emotionally toiled scream as the hallucination of her mother confirmed her love for her, prompting Azula to fire a lightning bolt at the mirage, stating the love declaration to be nothing more than Ursa's last treasonous attempt to set her own mind against her.[15]\n\nAzula chases off the moth wasps\nAzula saved Team Avatar from a moth wasp attack.\nAt that point, Zuko arrived and asked to whom she had been speaking. Reacting aggressively, Azula wanted to strike her brother down but was encased in ice by Katara before she got the chance. As the waterbender approached her, she accused her of being one of Ursa's co-conspirators. Her rant, however, was interrupted when the wolf spirit appeared and attacked the group. As they were being overpowered by moth wasps coughed up by the spirit, Azula asked Zuko to free her so she could help, convincing him that she could not possibly make things worse for them and stating that if he could not even trust his own family, there was no one left to be trusted. He melted her icy restraints, and true to her word, she created a large lightning bolt and shot it away from the group, drawing the light-oriented moth wasps and wolf spirit with it. That night, Azula was talking in her sleep and shivering from the cold before Zuko covered her with a blanket: during this time, he found the letter she was hiding and was left stunned by its contents.[15]\n\nThe next day, the princess was awoken by another hallucination of Ursa. She was urged by her mother to stop what she was doing, as Ursa believed it was not Azula's destiny to assume the throne. In response, Azula intended to shoot her mother with lightning, but Ursa only pleaded with her more urgently to find her true destiny. Azula snapped out of her hallucination with Katara's wrist in her grip; Sokka hurled his boomerang, striking Azula's forearm and forcing her to release her grip, but Katara managed to calm both sides down. After her outburst, Azula discovered that the letter she had kept was missing and immediately assumed that Zuko had taken it. Her brother was not at camp, however, and Azula threatened Sokka and Katara with fire to force them to tell her where Zuko had gone. After burning down some nearby vegetation, she stormed off after Zuko.[23]\n\nAzula demanding Ursa's letter\nAzula demanded Ursa's letter back from Zuko, believing it to be her key to the Fire Nation throne.\nAzula found her brother sitting with Aang at the edge of a cliff discussing the letter questioning his heritage. Frustrated, she shot fire blasts at him, and a duel broke out. While Aang ran back to check up on Sokka and Katara, Azula was grabbed by Zuko and held over the cliff while she accused their mother of tipping him off to the letter's location before learning that he had held it all night. Zuko requested that they stop their fighting, to which Azula agreed, and they both returned to camp. After the rest of the team put out the fires, the entire group continued their journey to Hira'a.[23]\n\nThey reached the border of Hira'a, and the Team Avatar disguised themselves using crimson robes. Azula was the only one who still wore her own outfit. The group arrived just as a performance of Love amongst the Dragons was ending. Azula and Zuko recalled the times they used to see the play and how they acted out the battle scene; Azula bragged she made a better Dragon Emperor, which is why she took up the role between the two. The play ended, and Azula followed the others. They met the leader of the Hira'a acting troupe, Noren, who offered them information on Ursa in addition to tea and an invitation to his and his wife, Noriko's, home. Azula and Zuko spoke with the couple's daughter, Kiyi, about her doll. The princess mentioned she used to give her dolls \"headcuts\" instead of haircuts, offering one for Kiyi's doll, which scared the young girl and caused Zuko to berate his sister. Afterward, the firebender remarked that she was \"tempted to burn the whole place down, but resisted for [Zuko]\". The thought drew Katara's ire, causing the two girls to argue. The increasing tensions between Katara and Azula resulted in Zuko declaring that Forgetful Valley would be the last stop for the trip.[23]\n\nAzula saving Sokka\nAzula saved Sokka from Misu's plantbending attack.\nUpon arrival, Azula attempted to make a path by burning parts of the valley, drawing criticism from the rest of the group once more. When Aang found a flutter bat that brought him to a pond, Azula and the others followed the two there. The Avatar said it was a spiritual place and urged everyone to respect it, but Azula once again saw a hallucination of Ursa urging her to stop the mission. The princess promptly went against Aang's word and blasted the pond with lightning, and yelled at Aang that Ursa had told him to bring them there. Katara was about to freeze her in place, but a rain of flower-shaped ice discs began to attack the team, and the nearby plants began to pull the team in one by one. Azula saved Sokka from a vine, explaining that the more \"peasants\" she kept around, the higher her chances of survival were. Katara countered with plantbending and ordered whoever was attacking to reveal themselves to the team.[23]\n\nRafa and Misu, brother and sister themselves, arrived and set up camp with the group. Misu warned them that Forgetful Valley's ponds needed to remain undisturbed. She told her and Rafa's story to the team; the sibling bond they had resulted in uncertain looks from Azula and her brother. The princess cut the story short and asked about Ursa, to which Misu replied that neither she nor Rafa had seen her. As Aang prepared to cross into the Spirit World to seek out the wolf spirit, Azula walked away; when confronted by Zuko, she snapped at him, wondering if they were really going to find their mother or help \"a couple of vagrants\". Zuko said that it was Aang's duty to help people, and Azula sneered at the Fire Lord for not wanting to hold the throne anymore, traveling with Team Avatar to help people instead. Her focus quickly shifted toward her psychotic beliefs, and she accused Ursa of orchestrating Rafa and Misu's arrival to throw them off her trail. She prepared to shoot lightning at the siblings, warning her mother that her plans would fail.[23]\n\nAzula breaks in\nAzula broke into Noren and Noriko's home through the ceiling after finding out that Noriko was really her mother, Ursa.\nHer attack was thwarted by Zuko, however, and she was forced to calm down, awaiting Aang's return. When the Avatar brought the Mother of Faces with him, Azula interrupted Misu's plea to the spirit to grant her brother a new face with a demand to know about Ursa. After learning that the Mother of Faces had given Ursa a new identity as Noriko, Azula promptly took off to Hira'a with her brother and Sokka chasing after her. Barging into Noren and Noriko's house, Azula was finally able to confront her mother, demanding to know if Kiyi was supposed to be her replacement because she was such a monster. Sokka held her off temporarily, but the princess ultimately slammed Ursa to the wall and prepared a ball of fire, intent upon killing her.[16]\n\nShe teared up when her amnesiac mother apologized for not loving her enough, but after being separated from her by Zuko, she began attacking him. Azula asked Zuko why he would not allow her to take the throne, saying he would be free of something he did not want, while it would rid her of the \"incessant nagging in [her] head\". Upon being told that she was wrong, Azula protested, reminding him that he had the opportunity to throw her over the cliff and be rid of both her and the letter. Zuko answered that he knew the throne was his destiny and went on to say that no matter how messy their relationship was, she was still his sister. Azula, in tears, burned an opening through a nearby wall and ran outside, dropping the letter in the process. She ran off toward the Forgetful Valley, calling her brother weak when he begged her to stay so that he could help her and vanishing from sight.[16] Although Zuko tried to find her in the weeks before he returned to the capital with Ursa, Ikem, Kiyi, and Team Avatar, Azula managed to remain hidden, which caused Zuko to believe that she did not want to be found.[17]\n\nMasquerading as the Kemurikage\n\nFire Warriors\nFollowing the events in Hira'a, Azula freed several of her acquaintances and subsequently organized them as a strike team impersonating the Kemurikage.\nAt some point during her exile, Azula came to the conclusion that her destiny was to manipulate Zuko into a Fire Lord who ruled by fear. She also reevaluated her relationship with her family, discarding any remaining loyalty to Ozai and accepting Kiyi as a blood relation. At this point, her hallucinations had stopped. Recalling how Mai talked about Kemurikage in her sleep during a sleepover from when they were children inspired Azula to masquerade in the image of the mythical spirits to enact her plans.[19] Azula subsequently left Forgetful Valley and helped her friends escape from a facility for the mentally ill, which also institutionalized many daughters of traditionalist Fire Nation families who were considered too rebellious by their parents.[38][20] She made promises to her new acolytes, including Zirin,[19] Ningka,[40] and Chiyou, telling them that they would do work to help the Fire Nation's downtrodden.[20] In her Kemurikage guise, Azula visited Ukano, now the leader of the New Ozai Society, and threatened him with harm if he did not depose Zuko immediately. When Ukano failed at this, Azula confronted him with making good on her promise. A terrified Ukano pleaded for a month to depose Zuko. At some point, Azula revealed her identity to Ukano, who emptied his bank account to construct a prison in the Royal Family Graveyard. In the next month, Azula and her followers began abducting children from the capital, including Tom-Tom.[17][18] Unknown to Ukano, Azula was using him the entire time, having no desire to see Ozai restored to power.[19]\n\nAzula tells Ukano to organize a riot\nAzula manipulated Ukano into doing her bidding while musing how she actually wanted to keep Zuko in power.\nSome time later, Azula abducted Kiyi but was discovered by Zuko, Aang, Ty Lee, and Suki. In the ensuing fight, Azula revealed herself by shooting lightning. Zuko redirected it at her, only for Azula to redirect her lightning back at him. Azula and her cohort managed to successfully get away with Kiyi through a secret passage. After locking up her half-sister with the other children, Zirin was starting to get very impatient with Azula about keeping the children for long. However, Azula calmly asked her and the other friends to be patient, as she had a plan. Azula and Ukano discussed how keeping the children is going nowhere, and Ukano revealed that he is upset that Tom-Tom is kept as a prisoner. Azula ordered Ukano to gather his Safe Nation Society to start rioting in the streets; although Ukano did not understand how this will help Ozai become Fire Lord, Azula softly said that her father was never the plan.\n\nLater, after the riot, Ukano said that their plan still was not making any progress and pointed out that he did everything she asked and begged for her to release the children. Azula went back on her promise, reasoning that if they are free, they will eventually tell their parents and Zuko where they had kept them, and thus she kept the key to their cell.\n\nLater on, Azula and her friends confronted her brother, Aang, her former friends, and Kei Lo. As they battled each other, Mai's knives cut into Azula's hood. Azula mocked her about her knife-throwing skills and attacked her former friend once more. Azula explained how she heard about the Kemurikage when they were at a sleepover at Mai's, having heard her mumble about the dark spirits in her dreams. While resuming her attack, she thanked Mai for giving her the inspiration for their masquerade. When Kei Lo suddenly bumped into Azula from behind, she quickly grabbed him and threatened Kei Lo, and mocked Mai about her relationships. Zuko was next to intervene, firmly asking Azula to release Kei Lo, to which Azula mocked what she believed to be a depressing attempt of Zuko to win back Mai.\n\nZuko confronts Azula\nAt the crypt of the first Fire Lord's advisor, Azula revealed that she no longer intended to depose Zuko but instead become a power behind the throne.\nAfter exchanging a fire blast with her brother, Azula ran off into a tomb shaped like a Lion Turtle. When Zuko followed her inside, Azula explained that they were in the tomb of the first Fire Lord's most trusted adviser. As Zuko pointed out that she seemed more stable, Azula suddenly attacked him. The brief Agni Kai ended with Azula pinning Zuko to the ground and raising a fire-dagger over his face, claiming this was how it had always been between them. Zuko defiantly replied that even if Azula killed him, she would never become Fire Lord and that she should accept that fact. To his surprise, Azula released him and said that she had not only accepted it but embraced it. She revealed that the voices in her head had stopped once she realized her own true destiny: it was not to become Fire Lord herself but to shape Zuko into a more ruthless leader who ruled through strength and fear. Although Zuko points out that she has lost now that all the kidnapped children were rescued, Azula countered that she had won, claiming that, in the last twenty-four hours, she had shown exactly how ruthless and authoritarian he could be. Before she could be apprehended, she vanished in smoke while commanding Zuko to accept what she made of him.\n\nAs Zuko addressed his subjects, Azula and her comrades, all still masquerading as the Kemurikage, watched his speech from a nearby rooftop. Hearing Zuko ask for his citizens' understanding and patience as he searched for a way to be a better leader, Azula smiled and sneered \"How touching\" to herself. Putting her mask and hood back on, she and her cohorts disappeared once more.[19]\n\nAbandoned by the Fire Warriors\n\nAzula continued to lead the Fire Warriors, though they were weakened after the Kemurikage plot. Some had been captured by Fire Nation forces, while others chose to leave the order. The group began to splinter, with some members beginning to act on their own, with Azula neither supporting or constraining them in their plans.[41]\n\nEventually, Azula orchestrated the destruction of a full grain distribution center, hoping to undermine Zuko's reign by sabotaging the Fire Nation's food supply. However, Ty Lee had caught onto the Fire Warrior plan. The Kyoshi Warrior had replaced the granary's stores with empty crates, and had ordered many guards to hide during the initial Fire Warrior attack. Azula was able to come to the aid of the other Fire Warriors, holding off Ty Lee and the Domestic Forces for long enough that her entire party could escape into the forest. In spite of the Fire Warriors' flight, the Ty Lee and her allies had already used their advantageous position to capture and arrest Chiyou.\n\nZirin reprimands Azula\nAfter Azula refused to rescue Chiyou, she faced Zirin's angry criticism.\nAs the Fire Warriors made camp in the woods, Zirin proposed a plan to go back and rescue Chiyou. However, Azula dismissively stated that her acolyte would have to accept that there were sometimes casualties of war. Zirin voiced her frustration with Azula's plans, objecting to the Fire Warriors putting themselves in danger for pathetic raids on warehouses. Zirin stated that the Fire Warriors wanted to move on from skulking in the dark like criminals, and that they needed to move on from undermining Zuko. Azula reminded her followers that she was the one who had given them a new purpose, and stated that it was up to her to decide what path the Fire Warriors would take. She demanded they continue their reign of terror against Zuko, going to sleep once she was satisfied that they would continue to cause chaos on the following day.\n\nWhen Azula woke up, she found the campsite abandoned. Enraged, she burned a Fire Warrior mask with her bending, and vowed to find the \"traitors\" and make them pay. She stumbled in the forest just as heavy rain poured down, and she trudged on to find what appeared to be a Fire Sage temple. As she entered the spiritual site, Azula was met by a solitary monk cooking a meal. The woman explained to Azula that it was a place for the weary, and that those who had need of the temple had no problem finding it. The monk also noticed that Azula appeared to have been struggling with great troubles, and that she was in need of help. She invited Azula to stay the night, explaining that the princess would have good dreams, as the temple was place of rest. Azula dismissed the monk's words as nonsense, and claimed that she had no troubles at all: rather, only Zirin and the others would be in trouble when she caught up to them. She also expressed her disdain for being expected to sleep on the floor \"like a stray dog\", and branded the monk selfish for not offering for a traveler to stay in the best room. Once the monk agreed to give up her own space, Azula drifted off to sleep, still promising to make the Fire Warriors pay.\n\nAzula receives spirit vision\nUnder the temple spirit's influence, Azula received a vision of her childhood.\nAzula dreamed that she was back on Lo and Li's cottage on Ember Island, and found herself soon greeted by her family on the beach. Iroh, Zuko, and Ursa hailed her as a hero who ended the Hundred Year War before being crowned Fire Lord, while Ruon-Jian complimented her for her good looks. Just as Ursa went to embrace her daughter and tell her how proud she was, her family faded away, and she experienced Mai and Ty Lee mocking her for thinking any of the dream could be real. Azula shouted at them to shut up, just as the dream came to an end and she woke up. The monk was shocked that the dreams did not give her peace, and told her that it was urgent for her to leave as once. Azula sneered at the woman's lack of hospitality as she left the temple, but only made it so far before the temple appeared again before her. She entered the building again, intimidating the the despairing monk. Azula declared that the temple must be a trap set by Zuko or Aang, but soon found a burned wooden turtle duck before her, reliving the experience of her parents finding her with the toy as a young firebending prodigy. However, the vision diverged from her memory when her mother expressed pride instead of fear.\n\nAzula debates a spirit vision of Ty Lee\nUnsure whether her former friend was really present, Azula debated a spirit vision of Ty Lee.\nThe monk said that she was trying to give Azula what she most wanted, asking the princess if her greatest desire was not to be loved and embraced by her family. Azula caught on to the fact that the woman was no monk, and started to deduce that she was in fact a shapeshifting spirit. She tried to attack the woman with firebending, but the supposed monk clung onto a beam above, with her form becoming less human. Azula stated that she needed nothing from her family, as all except Ozai were traitors, and that her father was now a pathetic shadow of himself after losing his bending. She stated that she was the only one left with a claim to the Fire Nation throne, and demanded what was owed to her. A noise started to come from the door to the temple, and Azula was met by Ty Lee, who claimed she had tracked the princess and her squad through the forest. As she tried to ignore the spirit, Azula started mocking her former friend for her Kyoshi Warrior appearance, and started attacking her with firebending. She voiced her anger at Mai betraying her for Zuko, and then proceeded to slam Ty Lee against the temple's wall, completely irritated with her.\n\nAs Azula restrained an unconscious Ty Lee, the spirit asked if Azula would kill her former friend. Azula asked the woman why she cared, but it was Ursa who responded, saying that she wanted to know as she cared about her own daughter. Azula denied that Ursa could be real, but her mother responded by claiming that everything in the temple was real enough in the moment. Azula told the vision of Ursa about how she had been hurt by her mother choosing Zuko over herself by poisoning Azulon and leaving. Azula explained that, without Ursa to protect her from Ozai, she became her father's deadly firebending weapon, and had no choice in the matter. She voiced her rage at Ursa for not letting Ozai kill Zuko so that she could have stayed and continued to have protected her daughter. She screamed that her betrayal by her family, her friends, and her acolytes was all Ursa's fault.\n\nTemple spirit watches Ursa and Azula\nUnder the temple spirit's watch, Azula was able to share her feelings with a vision of Ursa.\nThe vision of Ursa then asked if what Azula really wanted was for everyone who broke her trust to come forward and ask for her forgiveness, acknowledging that they had hurt her and promising to never do it again. Azula tentatively said yes, only for \"Ty Lee\" to turn into Mai, who mocked Azula for thinking she could be the victim. Azula was taken aback that her former friends were also spirit trickery, and resolved to leave the temple to good, but found that she could not escape without entering the room once again. The vision of Mai theorized that people always betrayed Azula as she was a a terrible person who got what she deserved. Just as Azula went to confront \"Mai\", she saw that she had the face of Ty Lee once more, who disparaged Azula for believing they were really friends after the princess had intimidated her life. Azula told \"Ty Lee\" that she was less than nothing as a Kyoshi Warrior compared to being in royal circles, but \"Ursa\" appeared once again, displeased. As Azula tried to shut down the \"spirit trickery\", visions of Mai and Zuko explained how Azula told everyone that she believed nobody could survive without her, but in fact, the princess was surrounding herself with people to manipulate and harm as she could not stand the idea of facing the world alone, having to deal with all the horrible things she had done.\n\nAzula rejects the temple spirit\nAzula angrily rejected the temple spirit's viewpoint, declaring that she owed nothing and was the rightful Fire Lord.\nThe vision of Zuko became increasingly inhuman, telling Azula she had nobody to blame but herself, and demanding to know if she would ask for forgiveness. As she shot lightning at the vision of Zuko, with a worried \"Ursa\" looking on, Azula boldly declared that she saw through the spirit's lies, and that she was finished with her. However, just as she started to firebend, she saw that the spirit had transformed into an enormous insectoid form, with the visions of her family withering away. The spirit revealed that its manifestations had not lied: it was a place of rest, but more specifically, it was a crossroads for those who had followed a wrong path, offering a second chance to choose for the better. The spirit told Azula that she had been offered redemption and forgiveness, but that the princess had rejected it. The spirit then said that its present form was now a mirror of Azula's inner self, shaped by Azula's cruelty and desire for vengeance. Azula stated that redemption and apology was for the weak, and that she owed nothing, beginning to generate lightning as she declared that she was the rightful Fire Lord, and that she did not take kindly to meddling spirits. Just as she fired a blast of lightning, the temple disappeared around her, and she found herself back in a forest clearing, declaring that she knew that none of it had been real. She walked back to find the other Fire Warriors by the camp, with Zirin having saved Chiyou and returned them to the others. Azula frowned, and after a moment's hesitation declared the warriors unworthy of her leadership. Choosing not to enact her planned revenge, she vowed to find new followers, as well as a new place to rule.[20]\n\nLegacy\n\nA Fire Nation drink was named \"Azula's Lightning\" in her honor.[42]\n\nPersonality\n\nAlmost perfect.\"\n\"One hair out of place.\"\n\"Almost isn't good enough!\nLO AND LI TALKING TO AZULA ABOUT HER TRAINING.[26]\n\nBorn a princess and hailed as a prodigy, Azula grew up to be egotistical and confident. She relentlessly drilled herself toward perfection and settled for nothing less from herself or those who served her.[26] She believed that power and domination were the defining traits of strength, and as such, would only help others if she thought there was some personal gain at stake. She had absolute confidence in her \"divine right to rule\", with which she believed she was born.[9] She harbored neither pity nor mercy for those she marked as treasonous or inferior. As one who wanted nothing less than absolute control, she likewise had remarkable control of herself, seemingly able to react to any situation at a moment's notice without losing her composure.\n\nAzula hanging from a cliff\nEven in life-threatening situations, Azula remained confident, focused, and deadly.\nAzula was marked by a distinct lack of empathy. Even as a child, she reacted with hostility when outdone, a trait clearly displayed when she shoved Ty Lee to the ground after the girl bested her at gymnastics.[24] This behavior would characterize her relationship with her friends for many years. Rather than care or love, her relationships with her friends were often based in manipulation, such as when she intimidated Ty Lee into leaving the circus and joining her cause.[21]\n\nShe was prone to asserting herself and her authority in a grandiose way, such as when she humiliated Long Feng in front of his former henchmen[9] or when she threatened the captain of her ship.[26] She also showed a need for admiration, mostly from her father, whom she emulated to a great degree, and from everyone else around her, though to a lesser extent. She reacted with despair and rage when she learned her father was going to the Earth Kingdom without her.[12] However, Azula showed a level of fear of him, as in the novelization, Azula notes that not even she could take him in a fight.\n\nAzula was known to have a sadistic personality, showing little to no concern for others besides her father. From a very young age, Azula demonstrated cruel aggression and a near-total lack of empathy toward friends, servants, family, and animals. Her own mother, Ursa, once remarked, \"What is wrong with that child?\" after observing her casual cruelties. Azula's first reaction to hearing of Iroh's son's death was to wonder whether this now made her father the heir to the throne. She later dismissed her uncle as a quitter and a loser when learning he had ended his six hundred day Siege of Ba Sing Se to grieve for Lu Ten.[24] She eagerly watched Azulon proclaim Ozai's punishment for trying to claim the throne and grinned maliciously when Zuko was burned and scarred by their father. She also did not seem to care when her mother disappeared or when her grandfather died.[25] Her cruelty was apparently infamous and extreme; when Iroh accidentally ingested the poisonous white jade flower, both he and Zuko quickly decided that they would rather seek help from the Earth Kingdom at the risk of facing certain death than the possibility of being handed over to Azula by the Fire Nation.[43]\n\nAzula relishes victory\nEven in simple games such as kuai ball, Azula thought about nothing less than absolute victory.\nAzula's characteristic blue flames symbolized the power she possessed and constantly sought to increase. Her lack of compassion also accounted for her ability to create and direct lightning, the \"cold-blooded fire\".[26] According to Iroh, the skill required complete control of all emotion, which would not prove difficult for Azula with her one-track mentality.[44] Because of these skills, she was also an excellent tactician, regularly displaying cunning, perception, and resourcefulness that allowed her to take advantage of almost any situation. She possessed good self-control, facing down Long Feng and deceiving him when held captive,[9] and could lie with a straight face and no physical reactions.[10]\n\nIronically, for all her refinement and self-confidence, Azula did retain some insecurity. As a result of her sequestered life of royalty, she had developed a considerable amount of social ineptitude, particularly in her uncertainty of how to act around boys, and she frequently intimidated them during conversations. Even when attempting to flirt with Chan, her domineering and megalomaniacal personality manifested in a way that disconcerted him and prompted his recession. Her overly competitive nature surfaced during a kuai ball game, and she later admitted her jealousy over how much attention Ty Lee received from others.[11]\n\nThough she seemingly looked down on Zuko all throughout their entire relationship, thinking of him as a weak and whiny boy who never stood up for himself or to her especially, there were moments when her opinion of him seemed to rise briefly. During her coup at the climax of Ba Sing Se's fall, she was truly pleased by Zuko's choice to aid her, musing that Zuko had always meant to be a Prince of the Fire Nation fighting by her side. Almost immediately after, however, his hesitation to fight Katara caused her disdain to surface, thinking of him as poor and weak for letting himself be goaded so easily. Nevertheless, when Zuko showed doubts about his actions in helping take Ba Sing Se but betraying Iroh, she truly did feel that he had accomplished his ultimate achievement, while at the same time feeling pity for the fact that he could not understand the significance of what his actions entailed.[45]\n\nAzula was never happy with what she had, always striving for more. After conquering Ba Sing Se, she passed it on to a puppet ruler to be used by the Fire Nation. When she was doubtful that she had really managed to kill the Avatar, she let her brother take the credit for the perceived kill, convinced he knew a way Aang could survive that she did not. She was always trying to get more to try and fill what she lacked, but it was never enough. In a sense, she was a person without a finish line.\n\nLater, Azula began to show signs of a fragile mentality. For all of her self-assurance, she was momentarily driven into a rage when Mai betrayed her by helping Zuko escape and admitted to loving him more than she feared Azula. As Azula moved to strike her down, she was, in turn, temporarily paralyzed by Ty Lee. After her friends were apprehended, the enraged princess ordered both of them to be locked away and \"left to rot\".[10] While it was apparent that Azula held herself in high regard above her friends, their sudden betrayal drove her to the edge for an instant, hinting at just how unstable she would later prove to be.[1] This betrayal affected her so much that she lost her normally cool demeanor, as evident when she later attacked the Western Air Temple. She was erratic and maniacal, clearly trying to vent her feelings by trying to kill her brother.\n\nWhile on Ember Island, Azula revealed her subtle resentment toward being seen as a \"monster\", particularly by her mother. Though she admittedly agreed with the viewpoint, the princess stated that it was emotionally painful nonetheless. Her time on Ember Island was also one of the few times she showed any sign of compassion for Zuko, as she followed him and urged him to return to the group when he was alone and in pain.[11]\n\nAzula reminisces\nFor a fleeting moment, Azula opened up and revealed pain and resentment about the relationship with her mother, despite her distant personality.\nAfter being betrayed by Mai and Ty Lee, Azula's mentality continued to crumble in the final weeks of the war. When she attacked Zuko and the gang at the Western Air Temple, Azula was evidently losing her sanity, as her attacks became far more vicious, and she was seemingly obsessed with killing Zuko.[36]\n\nThe tipping point came during her father's coronation as the Phoenix King, where Azula was told she would not assist in the attack on the Earth Kingdom. Azula seemed distraught at this and took this decision as an offense to her and her honor.[12] For her, Ozai always represented absolute power and perfection, qualities which she desired to acquire. His refusal to bring her along on a mission where the two of them would serve essentially as equals made her realize that her lust for power not only frightened her enemies but perhaps her father as well. Ozai responded by appointing Azula as the new Fire Lord to govern over the Fire Nation in his absence, temporarily satisfying her desire for power. However, she was unable to cope with the fact that the only human being who may have ever loved her was not only ashamed of her but still possessed power over her. Her father was the last person Azula thought she could trust, and Ozai's refusal to include her in his final conquest only served to cause Azula more inner pain. Knowing that her father would neither submit to her will nor love her, Azula's grip on reality began to steadily plummet.\n\nAngry Azula yells\nAzula's flawless demeanor was shattered by the unanticipated betrayal of Mai.\nOn the day of her coronation, Azula became excessively paranoid and gave into her fear of betrayal and being killed. She accused her servant of purposely leaving a pit in her cherry so that she would choke and got angry at the Dai Li when they arrived five minutes after they had been summoned, suggesting that their laxness could have allowed an assassin to sneak in, kill her, and \"be on his merry way\". Musing over the possibility that the Dai Li could betray and kill her, Mai and Ty Lee's treason still fresh in memory, she banished them.[1]\n\nIt also appeared that she was not sleeping well, as she had dark circles under her eyes. Upon Lo and Li's arrival to counsel her, Azula's fear of disappointing her father was clear. She became so enraged when her old mentors proposed to postpone her coronation that she momentarily forgot they were not firebenders and ordered them to fight an Agni Kai with each other. Ultimately, Azula addressed Li as Lo and banished her, leaving the sisters confused as to which of them had to leave.[1]\n\nHaving sent off her staff, she was left alone to style her own hair for the coronation. Frustrated by her inability to tie up her hair bun, she \"fixed\" the situation by cutting off a part of her hair, leaving it a tattered mess. Panting in frustration, she saw her mother in her mirror in an apparent hallucination. Ursa complimented her, saying that she always had such beautiful hair, though Azula dismissed the compliment and asked her mother why she was there. When Ursa told her that she would not miss her daughter's coronation, Azula told her not to pretend to act proud, stating that she knew her mother thought she was a monster. The hallucination of her mother refuted that, saying she did not think that, that Azula was just confused, and that she loved her. Azula could not cope with the declaration of love and threw her brush at the mirror, shattering it, before breaking down crying.[1]\n\nThis incident exposed a complex facet to Azula's persona. Although outwardly maintaining a cold and dismissive opinion of her mother, Ursa's banishment ultimately had a devastating impact upon Azula's fragile psyche.[11] As Azula's sanity began slipping away from her, this inability to reconcile her perceived belief that Ursa considered her a monster with the truer (though idealized but still true) maternal feelings of love and support that Ursa demonstrated in the hallucination created an inescapable conflict in Azula's mind that furthered her eventual mental collapse.[1] Another thread of this argument explored the possibility that although she was fully capable of acting cruelly without showing any outright regret, deep down, a part of her could tell what she did was wrong and felt regret over it, but it was just her indomitable will and emotional control that prevented her from showing it for many years. Nevertheless, despite years of such dark deeds, what remained of her conscience, in the form of her mother Ursa (whose love and guidance she secretly longed for but falsely believed she could never have), could still manifest at this point and reared itself stronger than before. Ursa's gentle, motherly concerns over Azula's use of fear and cruelty as her only means of maintaining relationships with friends and family alike induced a violent mental breakdown prior to her coronation; after breaking the mirror, Azula collapsed and sobbed deeply before regaining any semblance of control.[1]\n\nAzula's vision\nVisibly unstable, Azula saw a hallucination of her mother as her sanity began to unravel.\nAzula showed up at her coronation impatient and with her hair still a mess, though the event was interrupted when Katara and Zuko arrived to challenge her. She did not hesitate to challenge her brother to an Agni Kai and darkly smiled when it happened that outright indicated she was more obsessed with killing Zuko personally than tactically dealing with both Zuko and Katara when she challenged him to a one-on-one fight, considering the fact she could just have what remained of the Fire Nation army attack them. Her unstable condition shone through visibly, as Zuko could easily pick up on it, and this was shown further as her apparent madness weakened her fighting abilities for Zuko to decisively overpower her eventually.[1] She also was instantly goaded by Zuko into using lightning despite knowing he could redirect it and only changed her mind in the last moment to avoid what would certainly have been defeat by targeting Katara, leaving Zuko incapacitated, at which point Azula showed an increasing level of mockery toward the duo. Her arrogance and mental state eventually allowed Katara, despite clearly being far less powerful than Azula due to Sozin's Comet, to defeat and chain her to the ground. The moment Azula saw Zuko rose, the Fire Nation princess screamed in anger and outrage while breathing fire uncontrollably and furiously struggling to break herself free, falling into complete insanity, sobbing loudly. She dragged herself along the ground helplessly, the full extent of her madness causing both Zuko and Katara to watch with clear sadness despite all she had put them through.[13] This breakdown was the culmination of her failed relationship with her mother and her jealousy toward Zuko for receiving more of their mother's affection,[11] the betrayal she suffered at the hands of Mai and Ty Lee,[35] her defeat by Zuko and Katara and finally her failure to be crowned Fire Lord. This madness earned her Zuko's pity, and Azula was spared from prison and instead committed to a mental health facility on a nearby island in the Fire Nation for potential better treatment.\n\nAzula about to jump\nDue to her unstable mental health, Azula lost her sense of reality, causing her to act recklessly.\nA year later, a clearly mentally unstable Azula accepted the task of coaxing Ursa's whereabouts out of Ozai from Zuko, stating that not one day had gone by where she had not wondered what became of their mother.[39] In return, she requested permission to join her brother on his quest and to be allowed to travel unbound and with dignity. The Fire Lord accepted, and Azula was released. While she had regained much of her previous demeanor, as she haughtily commanded people to cater to her needs and forcefully reacted to irritating situations, though from time to time, she still suffered from psychotic episodes, thinking that everyone around her was conspiring with her mother in order to bring her down. However, she intended to find and kill Ursa in order to stop her from interfering with her plans to take the throne from Zuko.[15] In the end, however, she abandoned both of these goals once Zuko revealed that he would care for her unconditionally no matter what. Leaving Ursa alive and giving Zuko back the letter that could potentially oust him from the throne, Azula ran off from the remainder of the group.[16]\n\nAzula subsequently experienced a phase which she later described as finding her \"destiny\". Discarding many of her old desires, including the quest for total power, she overcame several of her insecurities. Although still somewhat unhinged and obsessed with ruling by instilling fear, Azula realized that she could rule through Zuko and thereby share the burden of being Fire Lord; this resulted in her feeling freer than ever before. In addition, she allowed herself to open up more to others than ever before, describing her new comrades as \"sisters\" and openly telling Zuko of her schemes. By extension, her opinion of Zuko had improved greatly; although still cruel and scathing, she insisted that he had the abilities to be \"strong\" like herself. Observing Zuko's public apology to the citizenry, Azula remained smug, confident that he would come around to her way of thinking in time.[19]\n\nAzula subsequently continued to lead her Fire Warriors through intimidation and force of personality, as she once had with Mai and Ty Lee. When the capture of one of their own inspired the others to abandon her and rescue their comrade instead, Azula once more felt furious at the betrayal and resolved to hunt the Fire Warriors down with single-minded determination. When the need for food and shelter forced her to take up residence at what appeared to be a Fire Sage Temple, Azula was initially as haughty and entitled as ever, even demanding that the temple's caretaker give up her own bed for her. When the Temple turned out to be inhabited by a powerful spirit that attempted to force an epiphany on her, Azula's inner conflict came to the surface, making it difficult for the spirit to get a proper grasp of what she truly desired. When confronted by the visions of her various relatives and former friends, Azula expressed several conflicting opinions and philosophies; she resented Ozai for turning her into who she was today yet continued to define her perceived right to rule through him, she saw apologies and redemption to be for the weak yet desired for her loved ones to ask for her forgiveness, and despite perceiving everyone else to be at fault for \"betraying\" her, she visibly freaked out whenever accused of the reverse. The spirit, in the form of Zuko, outright told Azula that the reason she surrounded herself with people to manipulate and hurt was because, if she was left all by herself, she would have no choice but to reflect on her own misdeeds. Visibly shocked by this lecture, Azula panicked and attacked the apparition instead, and when the spirit in its true form called her out on how she was ruled by her desire for revenge and cruelty, she doubled down on her principles and attacked it again. Even so, when she tracked down the \"treasonous\" Fire Warriors shortly thereafter and saw them reunited and happy, Azula chose not to fulfill her intended revenge and merely dismissed them as undeserving of her leadership.[20]\nAbilities\n\nFirebending\n\nProdigy Azula\nNine-year-old Azula flaunted her prodigious firebending skills before her grandfather.\nAzula was one of the most skilled and powerful firebenders of her time,[1][13] recognized as a prodigy by both Ozai[24] and Zuko.[5] The most notable feature of Azula's bending was her ability to create blue flames, which are much more intense than the red, orange, and yellow flames normally used by firebenders, though she was only known to bend normal colored fire during her childhood.[24] Azula also used her flames in inventive ways, such as creating jets of flames,[35][36] whirling disks,[21] and blades of fire. She often firebent using only two fingers, rather than with a closed fist or open hand as was commonly used by other firebenders.[7] Also notable was her ability to produce a greater amount of flames than most firebenders without tiring, and she was able to maintain successive assaults for long durations of time.[21]\n\nAzula demonstrated the ability to condense her flames by using two fingers, enabling her fire to cut clean through various objects. When formed into fireballs, the flames had a powerful concussive effect, able to firmly pulverize stone objects. She was also able to generate powerful shields of swirling flames that could withstand the full force of four simultaneous elemental attacks (and a boomerang).[27] She was even able to charge up her fire before releasing it, something she used during her fight with Aang.[28] She could easily defeat Zuko during the Confrontation at Tu Zin and keep Aang on the defensive, eventually overwhelming the Avatar, even fighting off the entire Team Avatar successfully before running when Toph arrived. Azula was even able to defeat Aang when he had mastered Air, Water, and Earthbending twice.[9] Azula was also capable of fighting off and defeating multiple Kyoshi Warriors, using both firebending and hand-to-hand techniques.[29]\n\nBlue fire shield\nAzula was well known for her trademark blue firebending.\nThe depth of Azula's potential was demonstrated in her use of advanced techniques, such as creating large blasts of flame, evaporating a wave of water that Katara threw at her, using her flames to propel herself forward like a jet, and minutes later producing and guiding lightning.[9] While she used her firebending less after returning home, she did demonstrate her abilities a few times, such as when she used her firebending to give extra propulsion to a kuai ball during a game, creating an explosion.[11] She also used her firebending to break free of her shackles and briefly attacked Sokka, Aang, and Toph.[10] Azula engaged in a pitched battle with Zuko and Sokka on the gondola, where despite Zuko's vast improvement in firebending and Sokka's adept swordsmanship skills, she still managed to fight them both on reasonably even footing, countering all of Zuko's fire blasts and returning with her own and forcing her brother to dodge a charged blast from her.[35] Her later duel with the improved Zuko ended in a standstill, with Azula deflecting all of Zuko's large and powerful fire blasts and returning with her own, before unleashing a devastating blue-fire enhanced fist attack that rivaled Zuko's own and caused a large explosion that separated them both. In addition to creating her usual powerful fire balls, she was able to shoot her flames behind her in order to propel herself through the air onto the gondola.[35]\n\nShe was proficient in the highly difficult technique of generating lightning, a sub-skill of firebending,[26] displaying a fine control of this skill. She could perform minute flickers of lightning, which she used to both temporarily blind Zuko or disarm Sokka of his boomerang, as well as produce large, compressed balls of lightning, as exemplified when she created such a ball to send away a swarm of moth wasps, who were attracted by the intense light.[15] After learning of the ability to also redirect lightning, she applied herself to the technique and came to master it as well. With this ability, she proved to be more than a match for Zuko in their next battle.[19]\n\nAzula fights Zuko\nAzula's firebending became more dangerous under the influence of Sozin's Comet.\nAs Azula gradually lost her sanity prior to the arrival of Sozin's Comet, her firebending became unfocused and wild, which, combined with the Comet's empowering effects, made her all the more dangerous. However, it also resulted in her becoming exhausted more easily than usual. Despite her state of mind, she retained considerably great levels of firebending power and prowess, as shown by how she was initially able to rival Zuko's equally enhanced sheets of flame with her own amplified blue flames, before she became exhausted and had to propel herself using fire jets to continue trading blows with Zuko, ultimately being overpowered by her brother, forcing her to resort to attacking Katara with lightning to incapacitate him, and afterward was able to dominate Katara, fiercely firing wide strikes of lightning and enormous blue flame blasts as well as propelling herself quickly through the air to keep chase. However, her mental instability ultimately proved to have hindered her fighting prowess enough for Azula to finally be defeated by Katara despite at the time being far more powerful than her. She displayed the ability to breathe fire as she struggled with her chains and lost all sanity.[1][13]\n\nIntelligence\n\nTracking Appa\nAzula realized right away that Aang wanted to trick her, telling Mai and Ty Lee to follow Appa's real trail while she fought the Avatar.\nAzula was an extremely intelligent and cunning strategist. She was also a highly studious girl. Since childhood, she was well-versed in her nation's military history as she successfully recounted Fire Lord Sozin's strategy in an old battle.[24] She planned a trap for Iroh and Zuko, which was only accidentally foiled by the captain of her ship.[26] She immediately discerned the Avatar's plan to mislead her with a false trail.[27] She also displayed incredible fighting prowess in learning the fighting styles of her foes, such as the sweeping wind kick ability displayed by Aang against her during the battle of the drill. She imitated it in the form of a sweeping fire kick during her battle with the Kyoshi warriors tending to Appa, utilizing that move to end her battle with Suki. With the Kyoshi warriors finally captured, Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai used their robes, stealing their identities to freely enter Ba Sing Se and the Earth King's palace, beginning her coup against the Earth King. This coup was single-handedly orchestrated by her, winning Ba Sing Se for the Fire Nation.[8][9] During the Day of Black Sun, she laid a trap for Aang and his friends using Dai Li agents in the Fire Lord's throne room, ensuring that the eclipse time would be used up.[10] She also displayed the ability to be so extremely capable of lying effectively that even Toph could not sense it regardless of how blatant the lie was, showing that Azula did not feel remorse for lying or many of her other actions.[10] She also displayed an ability to realize whether or not someone was telling the truth, stating simply that she was a \"people person\".[35]\n\nEven under the effects of her mental illness, her wit and ability to strategize were not completely lost, as despite being excessively provoked by Zuko's taunts of fearing his lightning redirection, she still could come up with a strategy to overpower her brother by aiming the lightning at Katara instead, which succeeded in incapacitating Zuko. A year later, she managed to use the after effects of chi-blocking, which caused her body joints to become extremely flexible, to free herself from her restraints and from Zuko. On another occasion, she was able to save Team Avatar from a swarm of moth wasps by using a lightning ball to attract them due to the intense light.\n\nAzula's intelligence made her very skillful in manipulating people. She used this skill on many subjects, including her brother Zuko,[9] her mother Ursa,[24] Long Feng,[8][9] the Dai Li,[8][9] Sokka,[10] and even her father to an extent.\n\nOther skills\n\nAzula evades Team Avatar\nAzula made up for her handicap with dexterity and agility to evade Aang and Toph.\nAzula's high-level skill in unarmed combat was displayed several times during the series. She easily avoided Zuko's frenzied knife attacks without the use of firebending, guiding his hands off course.[26] Later, she proceeded to disarm Suki and knocked her off her feet without bending.[29] She also had some skill with hidden weaponry, as she intended on using a shuriken knife during the eclipse.[10] Her acrobatics and use of a hidden shuriken knife were apparently skills she picked up from Ty Lee and Mai, respectively.[46] Azula was very agile as she was able to run up walls and perform mid-air twirls. She dodged Aang and Toph's bending attacks with little to no effort using high jumps like Ty Lee, ultimately making Aang admit she was too fast to hit.[10] Her physical strength was also adept as she could perform a planche, supporting her body in a horizontal position just by using her arms, with little effort"

For the character in Netflix's live-action series, see\nKatara.\n\nKatara asserting her protective nature to Sokka.[1]\nI WILL NEVER, EVER TURN MY BACK ON PEOPLE WHO NEED ME!\n\nKatara was a waterbending master, born in the Southern Water Tribe to Chief Hakoda and his wife Kya. During her childhood, she was the only waterbender living in the Southern Water Tribe. After losing her mother in a Fire Nation raid and her father left to battle against the Fire Nation in the Hundred Year War, she was raised by her paternal grandmother Kanna alongside her older brother Sokka. As a teenager, Katara and her brother discovered the young Air Nomad Avatar, Aang, who had been frozen in an iceberg with his bison, Appa, for a century.[15] In need of a waterbending master, the siblings and Aang left the South Pole on a journey toward the Northern Water Tribe.[10]\n\nRealizing Aang was the Avatar, Katara and Sokka continued to travel with him across the world as he mastered the remaining elements, earth and fire. She became Aang's waterbending instructor after their departure from the Northern Water Tribe, replacing Master Pakku,[16] who had instructed them during their time there. Her mastery of water made her a formidable asset to the group. The siblings' assistance helped Aang halt the Fire Nation's ambitions of world domination, ending the century-long war, and finally restoring balance to the world.[17]\n\nThe murder of her mother[18] and the later departure of her warrior father[15] left Katara feeling traumatized and alone.[19] Though she was cared for by Kanna,[15][10] she invariably found herself filling the mother role left behind by Kya, even to her own older brother. Katara soon took on many of the responsibilities expected of an adult and quickly became independent and strong-willed. Morally and emotionally driven, she developed a great sense of justice and compassion for others, becoming fiercely protective of those in need.\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War ended, Katara and Aang began a close romantic relationship[17] that eventually led to marriage and raised a family with three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend later in life,[20] Kya, a waterbender, and Tenzin, an airbender. Later in life, Katara became highly regarded as a master waterbender, and even said to be the best healer in the world.[21] After Aang's passing, she became Avatar Korra's waterbending teacher[22] and helped her to recover physically from her ordeal with the Red Lotus.[23]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the name of Katara's brother? toggle section\nWho raised Katara and her brother after their parents were gone? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Katara being the only waterbender in the Southern Water Tribe? toggle section\nHow did Katara's mother die? toggle section\nWhat is the relationship between Katara and Aang? toggle section\n\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nBorn into the diminished Southern Water Tribe capital of Wolf Cove to Hakoda and Kya, Katara faced the reality of her tribe's dwindling strength from an early age. At the time of her birth, fifty years of repeated Fire Nation raids intended to capture and imprison the tribe's waterbenders had left them devoid of benders. While the Southern Water Tribe's defenses would have crumbled under the might of the Fire Nation, the tribe's relative inaccessibility in the frigid South Pole and the Fire Nation's perception that they were a non-threat meant that they were mostly left alone. Katara grew up within a loving, close family and community in her tribe. When she was six years old, she broke a tooth on some seal jerky made by Ashuna.[24]\n\nYoung Katara throwing a snowball\nKatara was having a snowball fight with her brother shortly before the raid that killed their mother.\nHowever, when Katara was eight, the Fire Nation again raided Wolf Cove when charged by Fire Lord Azulon to find and dispose of the last remaining waterbender in the tribe. During the battle, the leader of the raid Yon Rha confronted Katara's mother, who was taking refuge in the family's igloo. Seeking shelter with her mother, Katara ran back to her home and interrupted their exchange. Realizing the intentions of Yon Rha, who had demanded Kya tell him the identity of the waterbender, Kya insisted Katara leave and gave herself up as the last waterbender, lying to protect her daughter. Katara ran to fetch her father, but by the time they returned, Yon Rha had left and her mother had been killed.[18] The death of their mother had a profound impact on both Katara and Sokka, and both began to feel deep hatred and resentment toward the Fire Nation as a result.\n\nWith the absence of a mother figure in the family, Katara soon found herself filling the role left behind by Kya. She began to take on many of the domestic responsibilities expected of women of the Southern Water Tribe, despite her young age. When Katara was around twelve years old, her father, Chief Hakoda, left to fight in the Hundred Year War with the rest of the men of the Southern Water Tribe.[15] Katara and Sokka were left in the care of their grandmother, Kanna. Though Kanna loved the two and cared deeply for them, Katara was left feeling traumatized and alone. Living in a tribe consisting almost completely of women, children, and the elderly, she took care of not only her own family but of the whole Southern Water Tribe as well.[10]\n\nWinter 99 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (85 AG - 100 AG)\nKatara frees Aang\nKatara freeing Aang and Appa from the iceberg.\nWhile on a fishing trip for Wolf Cove, Katara and her older brother, Sokka, accidentally steered their canoe into a rip current, where it was crushed between ice floes. The two found themselves stranded on a chunk of ice. After Sokka blamed their situation on Katara, Katara grew so angry that she inadvertently exploded an iceberg behind her with her waterbending. Katara and Sokka discovered a mysterious figure trapped in a large spherical iceberg that rose to the surface. The figure introduced himself as Aang, an airbender, and offered to escort them home on his flying bison, Appa.[15] After her village was attacked by soldiers on a Fire Nation ship commanded by Prince Zuko, Katara learned that Aang was the Avatar. She and her brother set out to save Aang, who had surrendered to Zuko to keep the village from harm. After their successful rescue, and after witnessing Aang's impressive first display of the Avatar State, Katara mused that they might find a waterbending teacher at the North Pole, at which, Aang quickly brightened up and suggested he and Katara could learn together. The three began their journey to the North Pole.[10] Throughout their journey, the group stopped in several locations across the world, mostly in the war-torn Earth Kingdom. Their first stop was the Southern Archipelago, where they first helped a local dojo[25] before arriving at the Southern Air Temple, where Aang had grown up. After Aang came across Monk Gyatso's corpse and reflexively entered the Avatar State, Katara was able to calm him down.[26] The trio stopped on Kyoshi Island, where they were ambushed by Prince Zuko and barely managed to escape.[27]\n\nFollowing this encounter, the team journeyed to the great Earth Kingdom metropolis of Omashu. On the way, they intervened in the siege of Shen Guan.[28] Upon arriving at Omashu, they were brought before the city's elderly king who treated them as honored guests before promptly imprisoning them. Katara and her brother were given jennamite crystals that nearly covered their whole bodies, before Aang solved all the king's tasks, discovering that he was a childhood friend, Bumi.[3] Before reaching the Northern Water Tribe, the trio had several other adventures while being pursued by multiple firebenders, including Zuko and his uncle Iroh, as well as Zhao of the Fire Nation Navy. Among their missions, the group helped several earthbenders to escape from a Fire Nation prison rig, including Haru and his father Tyro.[29] They helped the people of Senlin Village, who were being attacked by the spirit Hei Bai, before venturing to the Fire Nation where Aang learned about the urgency of defeating the Fire Lord by Avatar Roku.[30][31] The trio barely escaped the clutches of Zuko and a group of pirates during a confrontation where Katara lost her mother's necklace, a precious keepsake.[32] She also discovered the darker side of the resistance, when they came into contact with Jet and his Freedom Fighters who tried to destroy the village of Gaipan to kill its firebender occupants.[33] The team also helped two warring tribes, the Zhang and the Gan Jin, cross the Great Divide and to make peace, and later encountered Bato, one of Hakoda's friends and a Southern Water Tribe warrior, where they almost departed from Aang before being reunited due to an unexpected shirshu attack.[34][35] The team met Jeong Jeong later on their journey, who unsuccessfully tried to teach Aang the weight of firebending.[36] During Aang's training, Katara was burned and discovered that she had healing abilities.[36] When the group reached the Northern Air Temple, they defended a group of refugees led by a mechanist from War Minister Qin.[36][37]\n\nKatara vs Master Pakku\nKatara fighting Master Pakku for her right to learn waterbending.\nAfter their long journey, the team reached the Northern Water Tribe, where Sokka and Katara were celebrated as kin from the Southern Tribe, and Aang was honored as a special guest. It was decided that Aang would be taught waterbending by Master Pakku, but Katara was prohibited from learning combative bending on account of her gender. After it was discovered that Aang was secretly teaching Pakku's techniques to Katara at night, the master dismissed Aang as a student. At the palace, Katara pleaded with Chief Arnook for Pakku to take Aang back as his student. The master agreed to do so if Katara apologized, and while she conceded at first, she renounced her apology and challenged the master to a duel after being patronized. Although Katara was defeated, the master picked up her necklace, revealing that he had made it for Kanna sixty years prior, and decided to accept Katara as a student.[38] When the Fire Nation's ships arrived at the Northern Water Tribe, Yue took Katara and Aang to a hidden oasis, where Aang crossed over to the Spirit World. After Zuko unexpectedly arrived, Katara dueled him and was able to restrain him by freezing him in ice, but the prince overpowered her when the sun rose and kidnapped the Avatar.[39] Katara and her allies searched for and found Aang in the frozen landscape outside Agna Qel'a, and on their return, confronted Zhao, before the admiral killed the Moon Spirit, Tui. Failing to revive the dead koi with healing, Princess Yue realized that it was her destiny to give her life to repay the Moon Spirit, and transcended to the Spirit World. Aang won the battle after merging with the Ocean Spirit La and repelled the Fire Navy from the tribe. With the group now ready to move on and find an earthbending teacher for Aang, Pakku assigned Katara as Aang's new waterbending master.[16]\n\nSpring 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (Spring 100 AG)\nDuel at Omashu\nKatara fighting Mai in Omashu.\nKatara and the others sailed back to the southern Earth Kingdom so Aang could learn from King Bumi. While they stayed at an Earth Kingdom stronghold to be escorted ot the city, General Fong placed Katara's life in danger to induce Aang's Avatar State; but achieved only the destruction of his own fort.[40] During their journey to Omashu, Team Avatar met with Chong, Lily, and Moku, and with their help passed through a labyrinth and reached the city, only to find that it had fallen to the Fire Nation.[41] In the city, it was revealed that King Bumi had intentionally been captured, and Katara and the rest of the team barely managed to escape Princess Azula, Mai, and Ty Lee.[42] The team was later stuck together in the Foggy Swamp, experiencing hallucinations; Katara's own vision was one of her late mother.[43] Following their escape, the team visited Chin Village, where Aang was placed under for one of Avatar Kyoshi's crimes, and it fell upon the siblings to prove Aang's innocence. Although unsuccessful, they were pardoned after saving the village from the Rough Rhinos.[44] After the earthbender Toph Beifong joined the group in Gaoling to teach Aang, Katara initially quarreled with the new member of the group, but after being pursued by Azula, they began to trust each other more and became close friends.[45][46] Soon after Toph started teaching Aang earthbending, they were attacked by Fire Army troops and Katara was separated from the rest of the team. She ended up in a small Earth Kingdom town where she encountered and befriended the pirate leader Jiang and her crew after helping them with a smuggling mission. She was reunited with the rest of Team Avatar the same day and parted ways with the pirates.[13] Along with the others and Professor Zei of Ba Sing Se University, Katara visited Wan Shi Tong's library, where they learned that an eclipse would leave the Fire Nation vulnerable to invasion.[47] Katara proved vital in Team Avatar's escape from the Si Wong Desert after Appa's kidnapping by Si Wong tribesmen, and helped a family of refugees cross the Serpent's Pass.[48][49]\n\nKatara revives Aang\nKatara reviving Aang.\nAfter reaching the Earth Kingdom's capital, Katara first helped to thwart another of Qin's plans, by helping destroy the Fire Nation Drill, before being welcomed into the city.[4][50] Though they wished to inform the Earth King about the invasion plans, they were turned away, and found that a government conspiracy was taking place in the city.[4] After the team recuperated while waiting to meet with the king, they resumed their search for Appa and eventually found him in the captivity of the Dai Li, a secret police force under the leadership of Long Feng, who had complete control over the city and controlled Earth King Kuei as a puppet.[2][51] Team Avatar managed to subdue the Dai Li and began to plan an invasion of the Fire Nation in cooperation with the Council of Five, but a coup led by Azula hindered their plans.[52][53] In the Crystal Catacombs below the Earth Kingdom Royal Palace, Katara encountered both Prince Zuko and his sister Azula, battling them both even after a brief moment of understanding between Katara and Zuko. A battle ensued where Aang was mortally wounded by Azula's lightning, before he and Katara managed to escape. With the city fallen to the Fire Nation, Team Avatar fled Ba Sing Se with the Earth King.[54]\n\nSummer 100 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (Summer 100 AG)\nKatara and the Painted Lady\nKatara being approached by the real Painted Lady.\nAfter the fall of Ba Sing Se, Katara spent her time trying to heal an unconscious Aang while aboard a stolen Fire Nation ship with the rest of Team Avatar and several other allies, including her own father.[19] Eventually, Katara and the rest of her small team traveled through the Fire Nation disguised as civilians.[55] Among several adventures, Katara helped clean the Jang Hui River from pollution after disguising herself as the Painted Lady, and bettered her relationship with Toph, when she saved both of them from Combustion Man in Fire Fountain City.[1][56] In one village, Katara met a Southern waterbender named Hama and began to learn the Southern style of bending from her, but turned on the woman after she revealed that she was a bloodbender. Katara was forced to use the art against Hama in order to save Aang and Sokka from harm.[57] When the day of the invasion arrived, Katara and the rest of the team met with the rest of the invasion force and started to stealthily advance toward the capital via waterbending-powered submarines designed by the Northern Air Temple's mechanist. During the eclipse, the invasion advanced steadily toward Caldera City, while Aang reached the Fire Nation Royal Palace.[58] It was quickly revealed that the invasion had been anticipated and the Fire Nation's counterattack with airships destroyed much of the invasion force, with only Team Avatar and a few younger allies managing to escape.[59]\n\nKatara freezes Azula\nKatara imprisoning Azula in ice.\nAfter the failed invasion, Katara and her friends retreated to the Western Air Temple, where they started searching for a new firebending master to teach Aang, and unexpectedly found one in Zuko, who introduced himself as an ally. The relationship between Zuko and Katara was at first intense and troublesome, with Katara determined to never forgive Zuko for his betrayal in Ba Sing Se.[60] Eventually, Katara forgave Zuko for his actions after he helped to find Yon Rha, the man who killed her mother. Although she did confront the man, she hesitated from ending his life, but was able to move past her grief, and her grudge against Zuko.[18] Right before the final battle between Team Avatar and the Fire Nation, Katara and the rest of the team retreated to Ember Island. The team watched a play performed by the Ember Island Players, with Katara growing embarrassed and annoyed while viewing an exaggerated caricature of herself.[61] Although the team had wished to only battle Ozai after Sozin's Comet, they were made to act against the Fire Lord as soon as possible after Zuko revealed the plan to annihilate the Earth Kingdom.[62] After Aang's unexpected disappearance, the team traveled to the Earth Kingdom before going separate ways, with Katara and Zuko heading to the Fire Nation to confront Azula.[63] After the pair interrupted Azula's coronation as Fire Lord, a fierce Comet-Enhanced Agni Kai was fought between the two siblings, and Katara was saved from an unexpected lightning blast by Zuko, who redirected the attack.[64] Katara eventually managed to goad Azula into walking directly over a grate of water. While freezing her opponent in ice, Katara was able to chain the princess to the grate before rushing to Zuko and healing him.[17][64] She was present at Zuko's coronation after the team's successful victory in the century-long war. Later, Katara traveled to the Jasmine Dragon with Team Avatar, celebrating their hard-won victory. She followed Aang outside the tea shop and embraced him. The pair subsequently looked at each other lovingly before she instigated a romantic kiss, beginning the couple's formal relationship.[17]\n\n100 - 102 AG\n\nMain article: History of Katara (100 AG - 102 AG)\nAang and Katara's future\nKatara's vision of her and Aang in the future changed her mind about the Harmony Restoration Movement.\nIn the year following the war's conclusion, Katara and Team Avatar helped Fire Nation colonials resettle in their homeland in the Harmony Restoration Movement. However, when the group came to Yu Dao, they were attacked by Fire Army soldiers and confronted by Zuko. Aang and Zuko began to battle, but Katara managed to calm her boyfriend after he entered the Avatar State. The Fire Lord explained that unlike in the newer colonies, people of Fire Nation and Earth Kingdom descent had been living together for generations.[65] Katara and the team traveled to Ba Sing Se to discuss the Yu Dao situation with the Earth King, and while waiting, the couple met a group of young women who had devoted themselves to Aang and Air Nomad teachings. Though Katara grew somewhat jealous, she realized that they reminded Aang of his people. The couple failed to dissuade the Earth King from attacking the Fire Nation colonies and returned to Yu Dao to evacuate its citizens, where they were confronted by the Yu Dao Resistance before they explained the impending attack.[66][67] When Aang came to the conclusion that the four nations must remain separate after meeting the Air Nomad devotees in Yu Dao, Katara reminded him that the separation was an illusion. As the armies arrived, Katara told him that she saw their own future as a couple of different nations reflected in the families of Yu Dao. As the battle raged on, Katara propelled herself up to the Earth King's war balloon to help convince him that he was fighting a battle against his own nation. After the Earth Kingdom and Fire Nation agreed to make peace, Katara observed Aang welcome his devotees as the first Air Acolytes.[67]\n\nKatara trapping Azula\nKatara restrained Azula during her psychotic episode on the journey to Hira'a.\nSometime later, Zuko invited Katara, Sokka, and Aang on a search for his mother. As they readied to depart, Katara was horrified to see Azula, apparently escaped, but Zuko explained that she was coming with them in return for obtaining information from Ozai. Katara was unhappy with her coming with the team and helped to apprehend Azula during her psychotic episodes on their journey to Hira'a.[68] In the town, Katara and Aang were welcomed by Noren and Noriko, with the former telling them that Ursa's lover Ikem headed to Forgetful Valley. As they ventured into the environment, the group was attacked by their surroundings, though Katara deduced that it was the work of a waterbender, and Rafa and Misu showed themselves.[69] Another confrontation with Azula was halted by the appearance of the Mother of Faces. The ancient spirit began to battle the group, but it was halted when the spirit was reminded of her son Koh. Rafa's face was restored and Noriko was given back her memories and appearance as Ursa. Although Azula had escaped, Katara and Aang remained optimistic that she had begun to change.[70] Katara stayed in the Fire Nation for several weeks afterward and comforted Ursa during her anxious return to the Fire Nation Capital.[71]\n\nToph refusing to bow\nKatara happily took part in a bowing ceremony as part of Yangchen's Festival in the Yue Bay area.\nThe team returned to Yu Dao after the conclusion of peace talks and the formation of the coalition government. After a banquet, she found Aang meditating, who told her that he had seen a vision of Avatar Yangchen. Reminded of Yangchen's Festival, Katara set off with Aang and the Acolytes to pay their respects in the Yue Bay area. Katara consoled Aang when they found an industrial town built on previously sacred ground, and was surprised to see her childhood friends Niyok and Nutha in the area.[72] Katara and the team were confronted by Loban's guards and the Rough Rhinos for trespassing on the Earthen Fire Refinery. She discovered an iron ore mine during the fight, but the area was unstable and began to cave in, with Katara and several others only being saved by Toph's earthbending.[73] With Katara lending her support to Toph, the group was eventually freed with the aid of Aang and Toph's metalbending students. As a dangerous storm brewed on the horizon, Katara helped evacuate the town's houses and businesses before the arrival of General Old Iron. After the spirit's defeat, she reminisced with Niyok and Nutha and lent her emotional support to Aang in his challenging situation.[24]\n\nSiku and Sura waterbending\nKatara inspired Siku and Sura to waterbend.\nKatara and Sokka returned to Ba Sing Se for some time afterward, where they prepared to return home for the first time since they left the South Pole.[74] Katara was surprised to find that Wolf Cove had grown into an urbanized city, with the Southern Reconstruction Project already underway. The siblings reunited with their grandmother, step-grandfather, and father, and met Maliq and Malina, who were managing the redevelopment project. Katara expressed skepticism for the project, as she had seen foreign workers harassing the locals. After Malina was robbed, Katara and Sokka chased the thief to an abandoned ship, where Gilak and Thod explained that they believed that foreigners were making them weak and they had to be removed. The siblings escaped Gilak's men and headed back to the city, where they were surprised to discover their father's romantic relationship with Malina.[75] Katara remained skeptical of both the romance and the project and also met a pair of children that Pakku was trying to train as waterbenders. Aang also arrived in the South, following the end of the threat in the Fire Nation, as well as Toph, aiding in the construction. Katara later spoke to Sokka about how Gilak may have a point, only for Sokka to tell her that the idealistic vision Katara had of the tribe never existed. This left her realizing that her brother was right, as she had no idea of what the Southern Water Tribe was like before the war.[76]\n\nAt a festival, Gilak's men attacked, chi-blocking Katara and stabbing Hakoda.[76] After her father's recovery, Earth King Kuei was kidnapped. Katara participated in the skirmish at the Bridge of No Return, managing to save Malina from falling into a ravine. Afterward, she managed to inspire Siku and Sura to display their waterbending skills.[77]\n\nKatara advices Aang\nKatara asked Aang to be sure he was making the right decision about removing Liling's bending.\nLater, Katara made her way to Yu Dao with the team, though they stopped at Cranefish Town upon Toph's request. The group was stunned to see the growth of the town and Earthen Fire Industries, though they learned that the city was threatened with turf wars between bending gangs and an increasing social divide between benders and nonbenders. She was awoken by a large explosion at Lao Beifong's factory shortly after their arrival and helped to put out the fire.[78] Katara and the rest of the team investigated the perpetrator, which led them to Liling and her daughters. Toph had discovered a planned bending supremacist rally, which Katara attended in disguise along with Aang and Toph. Toph confronted Liling at the rally, leading to a fight where the businesswoman was captured.[79] Katara and Toph also disagreed whether Aang should remove Liling's bending. After the woman escaped, Katara helped to battle Liling's supporters and convinced Aang to stop when he entered the Avatar State to remove Liling's bending. Following Liling's final arrest, the group felt a special connection to the city and decided to stay, helping Cranefish Town grow and prosper into a metropolis later known as Republic City.[80]\n\nLater life\n\nAang, Katara, and their children\nKatara and Aang had three children by the time they were in their early thirties: Bumi, Kya, and Tenzin.\nSometime after the Harmony Restoration Movement, Katara married Aang and gave birth to three children: Bumi, a nonbender who gained the ability to airbend later in life; Kya, a waterbender; and Tenzin, who was born an airbender like his father.[81] Katara continued to develop her skills in waterbending, eventually becoming a leading expert in its various styles and respective skills and techniques, as well as being regarded as the best healer in the world. She passed on these skills to her daughter Kya, who became a renowned waterbender in her own right.[82]\n\nIn 124 AG, Katara wrote a letter to include in the book that Aang was assembling for Tenzin, in which she wished her son the joys of youth and the strength to accept his legacy as one of the world's last airbenders.[83] When Kya revealed her sexual orientation to her, Katara was supportive of her.[84] In the mid-130s AG, she joined Aang in watching Tenzin and some vandals clear the airbending gates on Air Temple Island. Aang noted that conflict resolution was not always so easy, but Katara told him to settle the easy disputes for now, as Tenzin was still young.[85]\n\nThrough Tenzin, who eventually married Pema, she became the paternal grandmother of Jinora, Ikki, Meelo, and Rohan.\n\nBefore 128 AG, Katara's efforts led to the outlawing of bloodbending in the United Republic.[86] After the passing of Avatar Aang and his reincarnation into the new Avatar, Korra, she became the Avatar's waterbending teacher once again.[87]\n\nKatara trains Korra\nKatara trained Korra in waterbending outside of her family's hut in the Southern Water Tribe.\nDuring one of her early training sessions with a young Korra, Katara taught her that waterbending was all about slow and calm movements. Her lesson did not stick with the Avatar, however, as she accidentally buried Katara under a pile of snow, not for the first time, when she tried to copy the elder's moves. Uncovering the elder, Senna apologized for her daughter, though Katara brushed it off, noting that she had battled more dangerous waterbenders during her life than the youngster and expressing her confidence that the Avatar will learn to control her abilities in time. The session got cut short by Tonraq that day, as a snowstorm was heading their way. Upon learning the next day that Korra had sneaked out during the bad weather, Katara joined Tonraq and Senna during their search for their daughter. Discovering the young Avatar safe and sound with a polar bear pup whom she desired to keep, Katara took the reluctant Tonraq and Senna aside and convinced them to let her bring the animal home, noting that every Avatar had had an animal guide and that raising Naga may be exactly what the high-energy Avatar needed.[88] Afterward, Katara and Korra's waterbending lessons continued. Korra often spent a lot of time in Katara's healing hut growing up, where she taught Korra to mend wounds and broken bones.[89] Korra eventually became a skilled healer under Katara's instruction.[22]\n\nKatara and the Order of the White Lotus\nKatara told the Order of the White Lotus that Korra was ready to start her airbending training with Tenzin.\nIn 170 AG, Katara supervised Korra's firebending test alongside other members of the Order of the White Lotus. She noted the Avatar's ferocity, to which the White Lotus leader responded that she also lacked restraint. After Korra defeated her opponents, the White Lotus turned to Katara for counsel, wondering whether or not they should let Korra start her airbending training with Tenzin, since the young Avatar had yet to grasp the spiritual side of bending. Confident in her son's abilities, Katara announced that she believed Korra to be ready to commence her airbending training, as Tenzin would be able to teach her what she needed to know.[90]\n\nWhen Tenzin and his family arrived at the Southern Water Tribe compound, Katara and Korra greeted Tenzin and his family. At her son's asking, Katara helped Meelo off of his head, much to her grandson's displeasure. As she expressed her joy over seeing her family again, Jinora approached her, informing her that she had read everything about her past adventures and asked what happened to Zuko's mother, Ursa. Katara attempted to elaborate, only to be interrupted by an excited Ikki, who fired several random questions at the old waterbender.\n\nKatara, Pema, and Tenzin\nKatara predicted her next grandchild would be a strong and healthy airbender.\nAs the young airbenders ran off to play in the snow, Katara turned her attention to Tenzin and Pema, the latter being pregnant with their fourth child. She predicted that the child would be an airbender, much to Pema's dismay, who explained that it would be nice to have a nonbending child like her. When asked if Tenzin and his siblings were as rambunctious as the young airbenders, Katara said that Tenzin had always been more serious than Kya and Bumi.\n\nWhen it was revealed that Korra's airbending training with Tenzin was to be delayed and the Avatar decided to find her own path by traveling to Republic City on her own, Katara was the only one who understood that Korra had to go and find her own place in the world. Confident in Korra, she gave her husband's reincarnation her blessing.[90]\n\nMonths later, after Korra's bending had been removed by Amon, Katara tried using her healing powers to restore Korra's abilities, but to no avail. She later witnessed Korra, whose bending was restored by Aang, energybend Lin Beifong, restoring her earthbending abilities.[21]\n\nKatara and her grandchildren\nKatara was hugged by her grandchildren upon their arrival for the Glacier Spirits Festival.\nSix months later, Katara invited her oldest son, Bumi, to attend the Glacier Spirits Festival with her and the rest of their family. She, alongside her daughter, awaited the arrival of her sons at the dock, having a joyful reunion with her grandchildren. She later attended the royal banquet in honor of Chief Unalaq, sitting at a table with her family, where she looked on with concern as Tenzin was being picked on by his elder siblings.\n\nThe next day, Katara encouraged Tenzin to take his siblings along with him on his trip to all the air temples, reasoning that he should cherish the time he spends with his entire family. She also felt that the three siblings should visit Aang's birthplace together. Tenzin agreed to let his siblings join him and gave his mother a farewell hug, promising to see her soon.[91] Before they all left, she gave Kya an old family picture of their family together while they were still young.[92]\n\nKatara heals Jinora\nKatara attempted to heal an unconscious Jinora, whose soul was trapped in the Spirit World.\nDuring the Water Tribe Civil War, Katara did not interfere between the two combating parties, believing her fighting days to be over,[93] and instead helped tend to injured rebels along with several other healers in her healing hut. She was sought out by her family, who brought a spiritless Jinora for her to examine. Alarmed over the amount of time Jinora had been in that state, Katara placed her granddaughter in a bath of water to heal. Assessing the situation with her bending, she stated she was unsure how much longer Jinora would be able to survive with her body and spirit separated, noting that Jinora was strong to have lasted as long as she had.[94]\n\nWhen Jinora's spirit later returned to her body, Katara happily embraced her granddaughter and later accompanied her and her family to Korra's announcement that peace was restored between the Southern and Northern Water Tribes and that the South was officially independent.[95]\n\nFive weeks after the insurrection of the Red Lotus was put down, Katara was visited by a still injured Korra and set out to heal her. Katara commented that the mercury poisoning Korra had suffered had caused a lot of internal damage. Upon being asked if she could heal it, she remarked that all she could do was help guide the young Avatar's healing process, though the ultimate result of that was out of her hands. Reminiscing on the feeling of going through a traumatic experience, she told Korra that if she dedicated herself to getting better, she would recover stronger than ever.\n\nKatara helping Korra\nKatara worked intensively with Korra to help the Avatar recuperate from her mercury poisoning.\nThe two waterbenders set out on the hard process of recovery. Progress was slow, however, and after nearly six months, a frustrated Korra snapped at Katara over the elder's inability to heal her. Katara tried to console her, stating it was all right and urging her to let her anger and frustration flow like water. When Korra admitted that she was tired of the situation, Katara told her she was not the first Avatar who had to overcome great suffering. She recalled how Aang felt about the destruction of his entire culture and revealed that he had sought meaning in his suffering, which eventually led to peace. She urged Korra to do the same and guided her to take her first steps again in a long time. Katara continued to help Korra over the next two years until she was physically fit again.[23]\n\nMore than six months after Korra's recovery, Katara came to Republic City to visit her grandchildren. She also reunited with Toph, who had come to the city to see more of her own granddaughter, Opal. Toph and Katara's families spent a day at the beach together with Korra, Asami, and Bolin. Katara and Toph reminisced about their days of pranking each other, and had fun instigating a prank war at the beach.[96]\n\nPersonality\n\nKatara had a warm, compassionate, and caring personality and often acted as a motherly figure to the group, something that often irritated the rebellious Toph.[56] She displayed deep affection for those she traveled with and was fiercely protective whenever their safety was threatened. Her inner strength kept Aang and their friends together through their most difficult experiences, even in the absence of parental figures. While the team traveled through the Si Wong Desert, she was able to hold the group together in its most desperate moments.[48] She had a soft spot for children, giving a portion of her food to a little boy in Jang Hui [1] and went as far to defend Tom-Tom, despite the fact that he was from the Fire Nation and that everyone else, with the exception of Aang, was distrustful of him for it.[42] This was because when Katara was a young girl, her mother was killed in a Fire Nation raid,[18] an event which had a tremendous impact on her life and arguably shaped her into the person she became. According to Sokka, she largely prevented their family from falling apart and took on many responsibilities to the point where she filled the void left by their mother, so much that he pictured her in place of their mother.[56]\n\nKatara as the Painted Lady\nEven if she had to hide her identity, Katara never turned her back on people who needed her.\nOverall, Katara was often marked by a fierce determination to aid others and herself stated that she would never turn away from people who need her help, even if she had other priorities at the moment.[1] According to Sokka, she was rather optimistic.[56] Placing her whole heart in whatever affairs she had, she was often easily reduced to tears. She was even willing to defend Fire Nation civilians, such as when she helped the village of Jang Hui,[1] and fought her former teacher Hama,[57] who was from the Southern Water Tribe to defend the Fire Nation village she was living in. This strong desire often frustrated others, particularly Sokka.[1]\n\nKatara was marked by a fierce desire to learn waterbending, viewing it as a part of her and her culture that needed to be expressed.[15] She may have viewed it as a hope for rebuilding her tribe and saw her mother's sacrifice not only to save a daughter but what she represented, their own bending style. Her enthusiasm for waterbending caused her to constantly train herself in the art despite she originally did not have a teacher and learnt whatever little she could with great ambition, ignoring the criticism of Sokka.[32] Her pride and strong mind caused conflict with the traditions of the Northern Water Tribe, which forbade women from learning combat focused waterbending. She became overjoyed when she finally found a master to teach her formally.[38] Like her brother, father, and grandparents, Katara was resourceful and very capable to adapt to her environment.[56] Having quickly and exemplary advanced under the tutelage of Master Pakku, he stated that she accomplished this due to her fierce determination, passion and hard work.[39]\n\nKatara was portrayed as the most mature member of the group, rarely taking part in Sokka, Aang, and Toph's goofy pranks, though she did have a sense of humor. She was a bit of a stickler for morality, even to the point of causing Sokka and Aang to faint from shock when she stated she wanted to pull a scam, as she had previously berated Toph for scamming people. Her loss was part of what drove her in her fight against the Fire Nation, although she did not exhibit as much outward prejudice as her brother. Although Sokka told Toph that Katara could be a pain and would get \"involved and in-your-business\",[56] she is understanding of other people's privacy, continually scolding her brother for snooping around Hama's inn and rummaging through her personal belongings.[57]\n\nOn the other hand, Katara could be overly domineering. For all her kindness, she was sometimes self-righteous, had a nasty temper, and could be fierce when provoked. With lack of sleep, this side of her could quickly become more apparent.[46] She was also set in her ideals and frequently refused to relent on her views in the face of opposition. Combined with her strong sense of compassion, this gave Katara a strong sense of justice and she would run headlong into often dangerous situations to help others, which was best illustrated when she faked to be an earthbender to mix with innocent earthbenders in the prison rig when she was not a fighter yet,[29] challenged the greatest waterbending instructor in the Northern Tribe for forbidding women from learning combat-focused waterbending, and destroying factories for their culpability in the severe contamination at Jang Hui while she infiltrated the Fire Nation.[1] Her short temper led to somewhat frequent, petty clashes with others, as she showed open, but short-lived, jealousy of Aang's talent,[32] and was frequently perturbed by Toph's confrontational and rebellious nature.[46][56]\n\nDespite being one of the more compassionate members of the group, Katara was one of the least willing to let go of a grudge, especially against those who she felt had betrayed her trust. She held a considerable grudge against those who had threatened Aang or had done things she considered morally wrong.[33][51] Upon her re-encounter with Jet, Katara reacted hostilely at the mere sight of him.[51] For a while, she was argumentative with her father because she felt that he had abandoned her and Sokka when he left to fight in the War.[19] At the Western Air Temple, she showed outright hostility toward Zuko and threatened to kill him if he slipped back to his old ways,[60] being harsh and unforgiving of Zuko even long after he had joined Team Avatar and gained the trust of everyone else.[18] However, this could be because Zuko's betrayal of her at Ba Sing Se[54] was far more personal than his betrayal of anyone else. However, Katara was sometimes willing to give people second chances. With much reluctance, she allowed Jet to guide Team Avatar to Appa, and appeared to be saddened by his death.[51] Also, she offered to try and heal Zuko's scar when they were enemies.[54] Eventually, even after his betrayal, she decided to forgive him and embraced him as a friend after he helped her find the man who killed her mother.[18]\n\nThe loss of her mother at the hands of the Fire Nation caused Katara to strongly express her emotions about that day to her teammates, bringing up the topic in situations that tested the feelings of both her friends and herself, reinforcing her relationship with her mother, albeit indirectly.[15][18][54] Occasionally, this fervor also blinded her from the fact that the people around her had also suffered from similar experiences and events that equally impacted them. An example of this was when Katara described her mother as just hers and without giving a second thought that she was Sokka's as well, or when the waterbender told her brother that he did not love their mother the way she did after Sokka tried to stop Katara from tracking Kya's murderer, greatly upsetting him. When she got the chance to exert her revenge against the commander she believed was the killer, Katara was willing to use bloodbending against him, ignoring Aang's earlier advice to forgive rather than take revenge. She deeply regretted her actions after realizing she had bloodbent the wrong man, although she was not above planning to kill the murderer, only for her self-conscience to stop her from almost executing him, understanding that violence was not the answer.[18]\n\nMotherly and feminine as she was, Katara was not afraid to go beyond her feminine looks and way of being to achieve what she wanted. When she and Toph were denied entrance to a rowdy pub because the both of them were girls, they dressed up as boys. Katara, in particular, showed her masculine side when wanting to ride the pub's mechanized bull; being even willing to start an all-out brawl with some of the men there who mocked her ability to stay on the bull. The whole thing ended with Toph dragging Katara away before things came to a head. The two later went to a spa and reflected on how being a girl was not so bad at all.[97]\nAbilities\n\nWaterbending\n\nKatara's most notable ability was her waterbending. She rapidly developed her skill at the art, as her fierce resolve to master the element helped her become one of the most powerful waterbending masters in her era.[39] Katara was identified as a waterbender when she was a small child after she cracked some ice when her brother teased her. She kept practicing even though she did not have a teacher as her father could not find any,[98] learning whatever little she could with great ambition. Over the course of her childhood, she taught herself basic waterbending techniques and managed to master some simple waterbending forms.[15][32] This was a difficult feat, considering she would have never had the chance to observe waterbending in practice.[38] As of the discovery of Aang at the South Pole, Katara was capable of \"pushing and pulling\" water, streaming small amounts and manipulating it into basic forms and movements,[32] and was beginning to gain some control over the ability to change its physical state, freezing it into ice,[33] as well as attempting to create sizable waves of water. What little she knew, she taught to Aang, who quickly mastered all she had to offer. That which had taken her years to achieve, Aang managed to imitate and outperform her within mere minutes, much to her envy and frustration.[32]\n\nKatara's waterbending remained amateurish until she came across a Northern Water Tribe waterbending scroll in a pirate-traders ship depicting several different traditional waterbending forms. Incapable of passing up such an opportunity to have formal instruction, she eventually made away with the scroll and first learned the water whip technique with Aang[32] and afterward continued to improve their overall technique. Up until their arrival at the Northern Water Tribe, the two showed considerable improvement and Katara's confidence in her own abilities increased dramatically. She demonstrated the ability to bend with much greater precision and ease compared to when she first stole the scroll, was able to draw unseen water out of different sources and bend greater quantities in general, streaming them into powerful blasts and freezing water with much more control than before.[33][62] She later developed several of her own techniques, including cloud manipulation with Aang's help,[55][99] and a hand-held variation on the water-whip technique.[38] She also demonstrated greater manipulation of ice and snow.[36] In the time between her acquisition of the waterbending scroll and arrival at the North Pole, her sheer determination and discipline saw her proficiency improve greatly, clearly surpassing Aang's. Later, Katara challenged the master waterbending instructor of the Northern Water Tribe, Pakku, to a duel. Though she was undoubtedly no match for the master, she was determined to not be beaten. She demonstrated more advanced techniques than she ever had previously and greater proficiency in basic waterbending techniques she had previously learned. For the first time, she was seen bending with her feet and transforming the physical state of a wave. Pakku eventually removed her ability to bend by trapping her body and limbs between spikes of ice and so won the fight without harming her, though he admitted that she was an exceptionally talented waterbender.[38] Under the guidance of Master Pakku, Katara's waterbending abilities advanced quicker than that of any student he had ever trained, which he accredited to her fierce passion and hard-work. She fought and defeated Zuko with the augmented power of the near-full moon. During the fight, she knocked him off his feet, deflected his attacks, imprisoned him in a dome of solid ice, and later a wave of solid ice. Though she was defeated by Zuko after the sun rose, she fought him again with the full moon and defeated him easily.[39]\n\nKatara waterbends\nKatara showed promising potential of being a prominent waterbender.\nFollowing the Siege of the North, Pakku declared Katara a full-fledged waterbending master in the short time that she was at the North Pole.[16] She continued to hone her skills, regularly demonstrating her waterbending mastery in battle. In Omashu, she blocked a flurry of Mai's knives by waterbending wooden boards into the air as shields in front of herself, managed to block arrows with a wall of ice, and retaliated by freezing Mai's arm in ice, only being defeated when Ty Lee snuck behind her and blocked her chi, preventing her from waterbending.[42] While in the swamp with Aang and Sokka, Katara used the stores in her pouch and caused enough pressure to the water in order to cut apart the vines, create large waves in the swamp water, freeze a part of Huu's \"swamp monster\", and create a coil of water to blast a hole into the monster. She then created large, round, razor-sharp blades out of the water to slice through the vines completely.[43] Later, she easily defeated two earthbending students by freezing them in solid ice. When facing Ty Lee a second time, she fought using the water in her pouch to fend off her chi-blocking attacks, forcing Ty Lee to cartwheel away from disks of razor-sharp water. She also stopped Azula from killing Aang by catching her hand in a water whip.[46] While crossing the Serpent's Pass, Katara made a bridge of ice for the group to travel across, worked with Aang to support an underwater bubble for the group to travel in, surfed around on a surfboard of ice, and formed a massive whirlpool with Aang to defeat the serpent.[49]\n\nKatara rapidly condensed water vapor into ice to defeat her foes.[50] When assaulting Jet upon re-encountering him, she used ice spikes, similar to Mai's daggers, to pin Jet to the wall in an alley.[51] While fighting off the Royal Earthbender Guards, she defeated dozens of them with whips and streams of water.[52] In the Crystal Catacombs, Katara and Aang fought against Zuko and Azula, whom she managed to cut one hair bangs and created two enormous whips of water, which she used to briefly trap her. Later, these whips were able to match Zuko's enormous fire whips. When she was finally surrounded by Dai Li agents, she defended herself with the octopus form and rode on an enormous wave which knocked down these agents as well as Zuko. She proceeded to escape on a rising stream of water, carrying Aang to safety.[54]\n\nKatara's waterbending later became even more advanced and destructive. During a fight with a Fire Nation ship, she lifted a huge wave to separate the two ships and formed a huge steam barrier between them for cover. Once their ship was hit by a harpoon, she used her frosty breath of waterbending to freeze the hole in the ship's hull, thus repairing it.[19] When Aang held a dance for some of his Fire Nation school friends, she created a fountain out of solid ice for beverages and the glasses they used to drink from.[55] At the Jang Hui River, Katara created a cover of steam and sped herself atop the water's surface. Assisted by Aang, she formed crashing waves and precise missiles of water to destroy a Fire Nation Army factory. She also blasted a Fire Nation river craft into the air and against a cliff,[1] as well as transported a huge bubble of water from a nearby creek to extinguish a fire.[100]\n\nKatara stops her attack\nKatara's waterbending was exemplary, as she could turn rain drops into weapons.\nWhen Combustion Man locked her and Toph in jail, Katara adapted to her environment, using her own sweat as a catalyst to form a water knife which broke out of a wooden prison cell.[56] During her time hiding within the Fire Nation, Katara met Hama, an elderly, yet powerful fellow waterbending master from the Southern Water Tribe. After learning this, Hama began training her in Southern Style waterbending. Among many techniques and combat tactics, she became able to condense moisture in the air to create her own water source for her bending and could remove water from plant life.[57] Alternatively, with the latter skill she could bend the plants by controlling the water inside them.[69] During their duel, Katara stood her ground against Hama's blast of water instead of redirecting it, which shocked the old bender into silence and allowed Katara to temporarily gain the upper hand.\n\nOn the Day of Black Sun, Katara fought against the Fire Nation guards at the capital, destroying several guard towers with Sokka and defeating many soldiers.[58][59] At the Western Air Temple, she rained ice spikes onto Combustion Man.[60] While tracking down her mother's killer, Katara used the enhanced power of the full moon to nearly take down a whole Fire Nation ship of the Southern Raiders single-handedly. During her encounter with Yon Rha, she created a large wide dome of water by gathering rain drops and created ice spikes from it, nearly killing him.[18] Katara's prowess was formidable enough to fight against such prodigious master benders like Azula. Finally, during Sozin's Comet, she froze herself and Azula into a block of solid ice, thawed the center of it, and chained Azula to a water grate.[17]\n\nHealing\n\nKatara heals her hands\nKatara used her waterbending abilities as a remedy.\nKatara's innate aptitude toward waterbending abilities made her a rare case to naturally have access to the incredible ability to heal by manipulating the chi paths in a person's body, including herself. She inadvertently discovered this ability after Aang accidentally burned her hands and subsequently used this power again to heal Aang's own burn after his face-off with Admiral Zhao.[36] Once she reached the Northern Water Tribe, she further developed this ability by training with Yagoda.[38] By the time the gang met the General Fong, she healed several of his injured earthbending troops. However, Katara unsuccessfully attempted to heal Jet after he was fatally wounded by Long Feng.[51]\n\nWith the aid of a small vial of spirit water, which held special properties, from the Spirit Oasis, Katara's healing abilities were enhanced.[40] Though she was going to use the spirit water in an attempt to heal Zuko's scar, she instead used it to bring Aang back to life after he had been struck in the back by Azula's lightning.[54] Even though she wasted out the Spirit Water, Katara's healing was enough to allow her father Hakoda to walk again after he was injured while taking out a Fire Nation ballista tower during the invasion.[58] During Azula and Zuko's Agni Kai, Azula generated lightning and aimed it at Katara rather than Zuko; but he jumped in front of Katara and let the lightning shock him instead, sparing her from near death. Her healing had been successful enough that he could rise to his feet just moments after she had begun.[17]\n\nAs an adult, Katara's prowess continued to grow, as she became well-recognized in her abilities throughout the world. She proved herself to be an excellent teacher, having trained her daughter and Avatar Korra to become highly adept masters themselves. However, even though her healing skills were recognized to be \"the best in the world\", she could not restore Korra's bending after Amon severed the connection Korra had to the three elements other than air with his bloodbending.[21]\n\nBloodbending\n\nKatara bloodbends ship captain\nKatara bloodbent the Southern Raiders commander.\nAfter learning all of Hama's Southern Style skills, Hama decided to teach Katara bloodbending, an advanced ability to manipulate the water within the body of all living beings, controlling them like puppets. When Katara refused to learn such a technique due to viewing it as dark and immoral, Hama decided to silence her with the said technique. Despite only just hearing about the skill, Katara showed an innate talent for the art, quickly becoming the first known person to break the effects of a bloodbender's grip and free herself. Ultimately however, Hama tricked her into utilizing bloodbending to save Sokka and Aang, leaving her greatly distressed.[57]\n\nWhen she traveled with Zuko to hunt down the man who killed her mother, Katara alone took out nearly all the Southern Raiders under the full moon. After she discovered where the captain was, she let her anger take over and used bloodbending on him, which stunned Zuko. When she discovered that he was not the man she searched, she released him, shocked and dismayed that she had just used bloodbending on an innocent person. She is the only bloodbender who was never known to have had someone else break free of her grip, though she rarely used the skill. Though this was the last known time she used the technique, Katara came to greatly understand its workings, as she was able to determine how Amon had used bloodbending to remove Korra's bending, although she was not able to restore it.[18]\n\nMedical abilities\n\nKatara's knowledge of healing extended outside the waterbending subskill: She was versed in midwifery, as she had helped her grandmother deliver many babies in the Southern Water Tribe and delivered Than and Ying's baby, Hope.[49] She also seemed to have been knowledgeable on yoga.[101] In later years, Katara was versed in physiotherapy, as evidenced when she guided Korra to walk again.[23]\n\nPhysical prowess\n\nKatara dancing\nKatara demonstrated impressive acrobatic skill when she performed a dance with Aang.\nAlthough she mostly lacked skill in hand-to-hand combat compared to her allies, Katara showed a surprising amount of agility and employing hand and foot strikes in combat in her fight against Pakku.

SHE IS THE BREAKDOWN OF NEGOTIATIONS. THERE IS NO ESCALATION OF HOSTILITIES BEYOND HER.\n\nKyoshi was the Earth Kingdom-born Avatar immediately succeeding Avatar Kuruk of the Northern Water Tribe, and preceding Avatar Roku of the Fire Nation. She died at the age of 230, making her the oldest confirmed human,[12] and was also an exceptionally tall woman, towering over most people.[3] Kyoshi was born to two criminals: Jesa, a renegade Air Nomad nun, and Hark, a thief from an impoverished family of Earth Kingdom actors. She inherited her later signature outfit from her parents, adopting her mother's golden headdress and metal war fans and her father's daofei face paint.\n\nKyoshi had a difficult early life. Abandoned by her parents, she barely survived as a homeless orphan until being rescued by Kelsang who became her surrogate father. She was also not recognized as Avatar until she was sixteen; instead, her friend Yun was declared the Avatar. When the truth about her identity was revealed, Kyoshi's world was thrown into chaos. Yun was sacrificed to a monstrous spirit, and Kelsang was murdered as he attempted to defend her from Jianzhu, Yun's former master and the Earth Kingdom's de facto ruler. Fearful and desperate for revenge against Jianzhu, Kyoshi fled with her other friend, Rangi, and joined her parents' old criminal gang, the Flying Opera Company. With these unlikely allies, Kyoshi consequently traveled the Earth Kingdom and became involved in the criminal underworld while being chased by Jianzhu. After a series of tribulations and personal losses, Kyoshi forged a close bond with her criminal associates, entered into a romantic relationship with Rangi, and helped to eliminate Jianzhu.\n\nIn the following years, Kyoshi struggled to find popular acceptance as Avatar and keep the Earth Kingdom stable as Jianzhu's death resulted in tensions and a leadership vacuum. Kyoshi saw the end of the Camellia-Peony War in the Fire Nation, and later dealt with her friend Yun, who had been corrupted by his desire for vengeance against everyone who had lied about his Avatarhood.\n\nThese experiences greatly shaped her world view and approach to her role as Avatar. Unlike her successors, Roku and Aang, Kyoshi was determined that only true justice could bring peace and had fewer qualms about killing enemies to achieve this goal if necessary. Employing these methods, she was a generally effective Avatar. She prevented the resurgence of the disastrous Yellow Neck Uprising, stopped Fire Lord Zoryu from massacring the disgraced Saowon clan, defeated an attempted armed takeover of the Earth Kingdom by Chin the Conqueror, founded Kyoshi Island and the Kyoshi Warriors to keep her adopted homeland safe, and helped to reform the Earth Kingdom into a constitutional monarchy. In her later life, she maintained peace between the fifty-five states of the Earth Kingdom and helped implement policies to uplift the poorest and most disadvantaged, and saw the Earth Sages redeemed from a corrupt group of politicians to an order of wise advisors and academics. Living for more than two centuries, Kyoshi led the world into an unprecedented time of peace.\n\nHowever, some of her actions also caused long-term problems for the Earth Kingdom: The deaths of Jianzhu, as well as Chin and her foundation of the Dai Li, would lead to the decline and eventual fall of her home country in the centuries following her lifetime. After her death, the Dai Li obeyed Earth King Jialun's orders to purge the sages who attempted to maintain Kyoshi's policies of peace and prosperity. Because of this, Kyoshi came to deeply regret the creation of the Dai Li.[13]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nHow tall was Avatar Kyoshi? toggle section\nWhat is the age of Avatar Kyoshi at the time of her death? toggle section\nWho were the parents of Avatar Kyoshi and what were their professions? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Avatar Kyoshi's signature outfit? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\nEarly life\n\nKyoshi was born in the year 312 BG[7] somewhere in the Earth Kingdom. Her exact birthplace was unknown even to her.[14] At the time of her birth, the country was destabilized by the Yellow Neck Uprising and marauding bandit groups known as daofei.[15] One of the most powerful crime networks, the Flying Opera Company, was led by Kyoshi's parents, Jesa and Hark. Her parenthood was unusual, as her mother Jesa was a renegade Air Nomad nun, whereas her father Hark descended from a distinguished but impoverished line of Earth Kingdom actors.[14][16] Following Kyoshi's birth, her parents opted to lay low and mostly refrained from participating in criminal activities. Along with their daughter, they traveled all across the Earth Kingdom in a wagon, never staying in one place for a long time.[14]\n\nWhen Kyoshi was five or six, however, her parents decided to leave her in the care of a villager at Yokoya Port,[14] an impoverished community of farmers and fishers located on a peninsula at the Whaletail Strait in the southwestern Earth Kingdom.[15] They left her a chest with Jesa's signature metal fans, as well as a journal that contained information about the daofei and their customs. When her parents had departed, the villager immediately reneged on the deal, casting Kyoshi out onto the streets.[14] As they were mostly poor themselves and had no relation to her, the people of Yokoya had little sympathy for her and would have left her to die of hunger.[4] Homeless and reduced to starvation, Kyoshi survived by eating garbage, making her even more of an outcast among the Yokoyans.[16] Kyoshi later blamed her parents for her misfortune, and came to hate them as well as all criminals in general.[14] Nevertheless, she grew extraordinarily tall, and was already taller than many teenagers at age seven.[15] Despite being larger than the others, she was bullied and beaten by the other children, most prominently by Aoma, the daughter of Yokoya's village captain. Aoma beat her with a rock more than once and claimed to adults that they were just \"playing\".[4]\n\nKyoshi and the Avatar relics\nKyoshi took part in the Avatar relics test, but never completed it.\nBy chance, Yokoya was visited by Jianzhu and Kelsang in 305 BG. The two masters had been traveling the Earth Kingdom for seven years to find the Avatar. They presented the children of Yokoya with a test that included toys that had belonged to past Air Nomad Avatars, but all failed. Kyoshi spied on the event, and Kelsang invited her to pick the toys despite Jianzhu's objection that she was probably too old to be the Avatar. Though mistrustful, she took a clay turtle that had belonged to a past Avatar. When Kelsang told her that she could take three more toys to confirm whether she was the Avatar, Kyoshi believed this to be a lie or trick, not used to kindness, and inherently regarding promises of fortune as dangerous. As a result, the young girl fled with the clay turtle instead of partaking in the test. The two masters let her go,[15] and went on to falsely identify an Earth Kingdom boy named Yun as the Avatar.[4]\n\nHaving realized that none of the Yokoyans were helping Kyoshi, Kelsang sought out her hiding place in the village and took her into his care. Used to being mistreated, the young girl was initially reluctant to trust the Air Nomad monk, but when she understood that he was honest, Kyoshi was overwhelmed by the Air Nomad's kindness, and came to see him as her adoptive father.[17] Kelsang always provided for Kyoshi when he was in Yokoya, but often had to leave the village for long periods of time, during which he provided money to various farming families to look after her until he returned. Despite this and the farmers' promises, she continued to be neglected.[8]\n\nOne night when she was around ten years old, she suffered from a terrible fever and lied alone on the floor of a toolshed while the other villagers admired fireworks from a traveling vendor. At dawn, she woke up as a result of her abnormally high body temperature and staggered to a field around the outskirts of the town where the ground was scorched because of the explosives. She instantly panicked and ran away from the spot, assuming that she would be accused of causing the destruction.[18]\n\nThe same year, Kelsang once returned to find Kyoshi had lost weight and had sickly skin, realizing she not been taken care of properly, and promised her that he would never leave her for such a long period of time again. At the time, Kyoshi was more concerned about the new kite-flying craze among the local children. As she had no guidance or supplies to make her own, Kelsang decided to cheer her up by using his airbending and the rope they found to act as her kite.[18]\n\nLife as a servant\n\nKyoshi without makeup\nKyoshi in her teenage years without her later iconic makeup.\nTo improve her living situation, Kelsang eventually got Jianzhu to grant Kyoshi a position of work in the Avatar mansion that was being built to accommodate Yun's trainers and entourage. While the construction of the Avatar mansion was still ongoing, Kyoshi met Rangi, a firebender who had been appointed Yun's bodyguard, and who soon started to regularly yell at Kyoshi and order her around. After a few weeks, Kyoshi realized that the firebender expressed some emotions in a particular way; yelling at people meant that she liked them. The two subsequently became good friends.[4]\n\nAvatar mansion\nIn her youth, Kyoshi worked as a servant at the Avatar mansion.\nAs a result of Kyoshi's desire for organization and cleanliness, the staff eventually decided that her talents would best be put to use cleaning up after Yun as his servant, as he tended to leave quite a mess wherever he went.[19] She also would help out in the kitchen and sort through gifts sent to the Avatar from time to time.[8][19] Enjoying her life at the mansion, Kyoshi fully adopted it as her home. Though she always remained somewhat apart from the rest of the staff due to her background and friendship with Rangi (who treated the other servants with open disdain),[8] Kyoshi cared for the other staff members and had a good working relationship with several of them.[8][20][21]\n\nDespite her greatly improved livelihood and overall situation, Kyoshi continued to face occasional harassment. Many other servants considered her stuck-up due to her closeness to Yun. Because of her unusual stature, she caught the attention of certain kind of men who sexually harassed her, viewing her as an oddity they were free to gawk at, prod or worse, with them believing someone like her should be grateful for the attention.[22] She continued to be bullied by Aoma and her companions when they got the chance to get close to her, as they had become jealous of her comparably better life as well as her proximity to the Avatar, despite being an orphan and outsider, while they had to toil on their parents' fields and fishing boats. Despite this, Kyoshi preferred to adhere to neutral jing and endure the bullying rather than strike back, although she was physically strong enough to do so. She also held almost no grudges against the Yokoyans who ill-treated her as a child and teenager. Because of this, Rangi had to save her from Aoma and the others before they could hit her. The firebender encouraged her to start to fight back, but Kyoshi refused this and Rangi's plotting to aid her in getting revenge.[4] Her rejection of violence included the use of her own earthbending abilities. She was only able to bend very large pieces of earth without any precision; regarding these abilities as useless for her servant job, Kyoshi rejected Kelsang's urgings to get training and generally refrained from using her bending at all.\n\nKyoshi, Rangi, and Yun\nKyoshi, Yun, and Rangi were best friends during their time at the Avatar mansion near Yokoya Port.\nOver time, Yun, Rangi, and Kyoshi grew increasingly close, the presumed Avatar and the servant girl in particular spending much time together. She developed romantic feelings for Yun, but tried to deny them for a very long time and told herself that his closeness to her was just his usual way of acting toward girls.[19] She also felt attraction toward Rangi, such as when she was distracted by the uncovered skin of her nape[4] and when she found herself a little too bothered by the idea of her never being born.[23] She did not appear to recognize these feelings as well as she did her feelings for Yun, but she tried to ignore them as well, denying her sexuality that would not be accepted by most people in the Earth Kingdom.[24]\n\nOne of Kyoshi's duties would be to help Yun sort through the many gifts sent to him by officials and sages from around the Earth Kingdom. One night while sorting through them, Yun placed his head in her lap as the two joked around. The two of them nearly kissed, but stopped themselves before it happened, believing that a relationship would be impossible due to their different social stations and duties. Neither of them mentioned this incident again, but whenever Yun saw fire lilies he would look back and forth between them and Kyoshi until she smiled and blushed.[20]\n\n296 BG\n\nMain article: History of Kyoshi (296 BG)\nKyoshi recites Kuruk's poem\nKyoshi shocked Kelsang by unknowingly reciting Kuruk's poem.\nKyoshi's life drastically changed in 296 BG. Kelsang began to suspect that she might be the actual Avatar, although Kyoshi considered the assumption ridiculous. The monk initially agreed to not voice his assumptions publicly.[8][23] Over the following days, she initially tried to continue to live as if nothing had happened, going on some minor quests with Yun and Rangi.[25] She subsequently joined Yun's team as he ventured to an iceberg near the South Pole, where a treaty was supposed to be signed with a pirate people known as the Fifth Nation.[19][22] For this occasion, Jianzhu provided Kyoshi with an impressive green, armored kimono that later became part of her iconic look.[22]\n\nKyoshi uses Avatar State power for the first time\nIn the battle against the Fifth Nation, Kyoshi used the Avatar State for the first time.\nIn the course of the tense, two-day long negotiations with the pirates, Kyoshi grew closer to Rangi but remained otherwise a mere onlooker. When Fifth Nation leader Tagaka revealed that the meeting was a trap to capture the Avatar, however, Yun was only saved thanks to Kyoshi's intervention.[22] Using a combination of raw power and the Avatar State,[26] she destroyed much of the Fifth Nation fleet in an amazing feat of earthbending.[22] This event caused Kelsang to reveal his belief in Kyoshi's Avatarhood to others.[27] With the identity of the Avatar being called into question, Jianzhu tried to learn the truth by presenting Kyoshi and Yun to an evil spirit known as \"Father Glowworm\" in the southeastern Earth Kingdom. The creature identified Kyoshi as the true Avatar. To her shock and horror, Jianzhu then left Yun to the spirit's wrath while taking Kyoshi to safety. Shortly after, Kelsang unexpectedly arrived and tried to rescue her, only to be murdered by Jianzhu. Overcome with emotions, Kyoshi triggered the Avatar State and was able to flee back to the Avatar mansion. There, she revealed the events to Rangi who vowed to protect her from then on. The two consequently escaped into the inner Earth Kingdom on Kelsang's flying bison Pengpeng.[27]\n\nKyoshi airbending with her fans\nWith support by the Flying Opera Company, Kyoshi learnt how to use her war fans for precise bending.\nThe two tracked down the Flying Opera Company, joining them to be safe from Jianzhu. Kyoshi quickly deduced that one gang member, Lao Ge, was an infamous assassin. He agreed to become her teacher in spirituality and assassination. Despite hiding their true identities, she and Rangi also gradually formed bonds with the other gang members, Kirima, Wong, and Lek. Traveling with the criminals, Kyoshi ended up in the daofei town of Hujiang, where the Flying Opera Company was forced to agree to assist a more powerful crime network, the Autumn Bloom Society led by Mok. While staying at Hujiang, Kyoshi realized that she was in love with Rangi; to her relief, the firebender shared her feelings, and she decided to no longer deny nor hide her sexuality. After fleeing Hujiang due to an attack by a shirshu sent by Jianzhu, Kyoshi was forced to reveal her true identity to the rest of the gang. To her pleasant surprise, the criminals refused to abandon her, considering her a comrade and friend. Kyoshi then earnestly began her training, being taught firebending by Rangi, waterbending by Kirima, and earthbending by Wong as well as Lek. Lao Ge also continued to share his knowledge, including his self-proclaimed method to achieve immortality.[27]\n\nAfter several weeks of preparation, the Flying Opera Company travelled to Zigan Village. There, the group was supposed to help the Autumn Bloom in rescuing a prisoner from the dungeons of the corrupt Governor Te Sihung.[27] To test her mettle, Lao Ge secretly enlisted Kyoshi to also murder Te. The operation succeeded in freeing the prisoner, although Kyoshi chose to spare Te's life after threatening him into becoming a better official.[28] To the Flying Opera Company's shock, however, the freed prisoner turned out to be Xu Ping An, a mass-murdering and deranged rebel leader. Xu promptly declared the Yellow Necks restored, and prepared to restart his destructive insurgency.[28][29] Realizing that she could not allow Xu to walk free, Kyoshi challenged him to a lei tai duel. The duel almost resulted in Kyoshi's death, as Xu turned out to be a powerful lightningbender.[29] However, Kyoshi eventually entered the Avatar State and killed Xu.[30] The Yellow Necks consequently scattered, while Kyoshi's friends nursed her back to health.[31] However, Jianzhu had finally located her and ambushed the Flying Opera Company, kidnapping Rangi and inadvertently causing Lek's death.[32]\n\nVowing revenge, Kyoshi confronted Jianzhu at Qinchao Village. After a tense conversation and Kyoshi's refusal to become the sage's pupil, the two started to duel. They proved to be evenly matched until Yun unexpectedly reappeared, ruthlessly killing Jianzhu before leaving without another word. Kyoshi then fled the town, leaving its inhabitants - the Chin clan - furious at the destruction caused by the duel with Jianzhu.[33] Kyoshi subsequently reunited with Lao Ge, Kirima, and Wong who had rescued Rangi in the meantime. The group decided to split up, with Kyoshi venturing to the Southern Air Temple in order to safely reveal her identity as the Avatar to the public.[21]\n\nRevealing herself to the world\n\nAfter revealing herself as the Avatar to the Air Nomads, Kuruk appeared to Kyoshi in a vision, pleading for her help.[21] Kyoshi did not fully connect with him, however, leaving the content of his request vague.[34] She also learned that Jianzhu had left all his lands and wealth to her in his testament.[21] Over the course of the next months, Kyoshi began to assume her Avatar duties. Before she left the Southern Air Temple, Jinpa was assigned to the Avatar as her personal secretary by the Council of Elders.[35] He subsequently became her confidant and friend, although their working relationship was often strained due to Kyoshi's unwillingness to do what was expected of her: namely, to aid and work with the four nations' elites, despite many of them being corrupt as well as self-serving.[34][35] Kyoshi found it difficult to be an approachable or diplomatic Avatar and failed to hide her disgust at the Earth Kingdom's rampant corruption. As she could not solve issues by talking, Kyoshi tended to resort to force and manipulation to carry out justice. She could do so, as her abilities as a bender and strategist grew steadily, also thanks to her studying the writings of her old nemesis Jianzhu.[5][35]\n\nFeeling unable to properly influence the Earth Kingdom's elites, Kyoshi eventually launched a one-person crusade against the Earth Kingdom's worst daofei groups, destroying several.[5][35] She also searched for Yun, but found no trace of him. Overall, her demeanor and opinions alienated many members of the country's elite, while the common people came to fear her.[34][35] To Kyoshi's own unease, she increasingly employed tactics similar to those of Jianzhu, and began to feel deeply conflicted about her way to do things as the Avatar.[35]\n\n295 BG\n\nMain article: History of Kyoshi (295 BG)\nBy 295 BG, Kyoshi was in Ba Sing Se, where she defeated Mok and the Triad of the Golden Wing, as well as rooting out the corruption of the city's peace officers.[5] She decided to pause her work in the Earth Kingdom when Jinpa notified her that Rangi and Hei-Ran had returned to the Fire Nation.[35] As she journeyed to the capital, she began to confide in Jinpa about her recurring visions of Kuruk, after an intense pain caused her to fall into the Mo Ce Sea.[34] Kyoshi arrived in the Fire Nation, where she was formally greeted by Chancellor Dairin, and used the opportunity to grow close with Rangi again.[9] Kyoshi's appearance at the festival seemed to prove a catalyst for the political tensions in the unstable Fire Nation after she confused Chaejin for his half-brother Zoryu, the rightful Fire Lord.[36] Although Hei-Ran helped Kyoshi smooth over tensions in the palace, the event was plunged into further chaos with the shocking appearance of Yun, who held the attendees hostage by burying half of their bodies in the floor with his earthbending. Yun managed to assassinate Lu Beifong, as well as killing Dairin and injuring his guards when they tried to confront him. As the earthbender managed to flee the scene, Kyoshi was left to deal with the political implications of the evening, as Chaejin's faction and the Saowon clan would use it as a sign to prove the weakness of a Fire Lord whose reign had been plagued with bad luck.[37]\n\nKyoshi and her allies came to the conclusion that Yun was likely possessed from his experience with Father Glowworm. Hei-Ran advised that they seek out Nyahitha, an old ally of Kuruk and herself. Shortly before they left for North Chung-Ling, Hei-Ran ritualistically cut her top-knot to demonstrate her lost honor, and made Kyoshi promise to allow her to sacrifice herself for Yun.[38] When they arrived, Nyahitha told Kyoshi that he did not know what the spirit had done to Yun, but promised that he could help her commune with Kuruk. The group also bore witness to the escalating tensions between the clans in the Fire Nation, giving them a sense of urgency to resolve the conflict before the nation descended into civil war.[39] That evening, Kyoshi and Nyahitha reached a bluff in the hills where Kuruk had once meditated, and she experienced a vision of Kuruk mastering the elements, although the memories did not provide her any help for what she should do with Yun. As they looked down on the city, the pair were shocked to find a large message supporting Chaejin as Fire Lord, which caused the rival clans to start descending into a brawl in the village square.[40][41] Although Kyoshi tried to intervene and beg for peace, she began to realize that the battle was proving to be a distraction, and returned to Hei-Ran's lodgings just as Yun was ready to stab Hei-Ran through the throat.[42] Although Hei-Ran managed to badly burn Yun, he still escaped, and Kyoshi chose to have the headmistress brought to her doctor, Atuat, instead of leaving to follow after him.[43]\n\nAs Hei-Ran healed, Kyoshi found that Rangi was now furious with her after discovering Kyoshi's promise to sacrifice Hei-Ran, though she soon showed that she still truly loved and cared for Kyoshi. Hei-Ran and Kyoshi then noted that the fight in the square would be a pretense for war.[43] Kyoshi deduced that Yun was working with the Saowon, as she confirmed that the town's crops that spelled out the message had been poisoned with salt, which was now owned by Lady Huazo of that clan. Kyoshi then made a plan to force a confession from Huazo, and came to the docks with Atuat, where she apprehended the noblewoman before she was due to depart Shuhon Island, although the woman agreed with her terms, believing that the Avatar was making a huge mistake. Kyoshi did not inform Rangi of her plans, and instead lightly pushed her down in the ground before she left so that her lover could not come after her and stop her plans.[44] Jinpa and Kyoshi flew Huazo to an Avatar-owned safe house on Capital Island, before taking off and informing Zoryu of the situation.[45] Although the Fire Lord was shocked, he gave her his permission to kidnap Chaejin. When she flew back to the safe house with Chaejin, she bent away the foundations of the property and intimidated the pair into revealing Yun's location; when they refused to answer, she threatened to drop both of them into the sea. After Kuruk's voice reminded her that going this far was not who she was, she realized that both of them were truly innocent, and let the pair go free.[46]\n\nWhen Kyoshi returned to the palace, she bore witness to an assembly in the Fire Lord's private theater, where a double of Yun confessed to conspiring with the Saowon clan, ruining the honor of the Fire Lord's rival clan and causing an immediate purge of the Saowon to break out across the nation.[47] In a private conversation with the Fire Lord, she pointed out that the ruse would be exposed if the real Yun showed up, and the Fire Lord agreed, stating that he had bought the Avatar more time to find the real Yun. In return for apprehending the real Yun, Kyoshi demanded that the Saowon and false Yun should be spared from death. Before dismissing the Avatar, Zoryu advised her to accept the truth that he was driven by revenge for his stolen Avatarhood.[48] Kyoshi then departed the capital on a small royal pleasure craft, Sulan's Smile, ordering the crew to take her to the ruins of Yangchen's island in the Mo Ce Sea. Although she almost drowned in the sea water, Kyoshi managed to cross over to the Spirit World, where she had an emotional meeting with Kuruk.[49] She received an extensive vision of his life, and realized that his own life had been shortened by his quest to hunt down dark spirits. Kuruk also informed her that spirits could not possess humans, and that Yun had been acting out of his own accord the entire time during his quest for vengeance. In the physical world, she was dragged out of the sea water by Joonho and his crew, saving her life.[50]\n\nAfter spending a month learning advanced healing arts from Atuat, Kyoshi made her way to Yokoya, meeting Yun in the Avatar mansion. After excusing Mui, Kyoshi confronted Yun, telling him that she had to bring him to justice for the sake of the world. Yun refused to be locked up by Kyoshi, and started the fight by bending up a stone pillar between the pair. Kyoshi managed to rip up the dining room in the fight, but Yun escaped the area and hid himself from Kyoshi throughout the rest of the estate. Kyoshi was caught off guard when Yun managed to liquefy the stone floor without heat to trap and encase Kyoshi, but then she revealed that the rest of the Flying Opera Company had come with her. Wong bent her out of the trap while Kirima attacked Yun, while Rangi sent a violent blast of fire in Yun's direction. After Yun hurled stone spears to fend off a potential rescue by Jinpa, he broke Kirima and Wong's legs by creating pitfalls when they tried to sneak up on him. After crudely using blood to complete their signature makeup, Kyoshi and Rangi used fire to destroy Yun's earth barriers, though Yun tunnelled down and stabbed Rangi with an earthen spike. Kyoshi attempted to apologize to Yun when he began to chastize her, but she made use of the opportunity to freeze Yun's heart and lungs when she could get close to him, while immediately turning back to Rangi and using the Avatar State to heal her grievous wounds.[10] After Atuat came to the peninsula to give more specialist care to Kyoshi's wounded friends, she buried Yun in Yokoya, and held a small funeral with Rangi, where they promised to stay beside one another forever. At that moment, a \"fox\" guided Kyoshi to a forest spring, where she met with Yangchen for the first time. The previous Avatar explained her own failings to Kyoshi, and that every Avatar had to make the right decisions for themselves. After the meeting, the fox guided Kyoshi back to her friends, and later became her animal guide.[51]\n\nFollowing her battle with Yun, she sent Lao Ge to intimidate Zoryu into keeping his promise to spare the Saowon and the false Yun.[52] Despite the turmoil in her personal life, Avatar Kyoshi remained steadfast in her mission to see the four nations rise above the conflicts plaguing them. She was not a popular Avatar at the time, as her closest allies were daofei and she sometimes fumbled in diplomatic situations without hesitating to resort to violence.[53]\n\nMaintaining order in Ba Sing Se\n\nKyoshi returned to Ba Sing Se soon after the Camellia-Peony War, and over the next two years, she helped establish a task force which swiftly dealt with the most dangerous daofei and violent criminals in the Lower Ring of Ba Sing Se. Kyoshi received support from Ambassador Quin of the Fire Nation in this endeavor, and the ambassador convinced the then-ruling Earth King, Yi Ming, to officially adopt the task force. Kyoshi was needed elsewhere, and left Rangi in Ba Sing Se to keep an eye on things, while the task force was given over to the control of the Earth King. Soon after Kyoshi left, the Earth King began to use the task force to threaten criminals who stood in the way of his power. When Ambassador Quin's children were kidnapped, Rangi saw the turmoil growing in the city, and worried that things would turn violent, and left the city to inform Kyoshi of the situation.[54][55]\n\nDuring this time, Kyoshi was contacted by Wan Shi Tong, a spirit who kept a vast library of knowledge. The spirit's Knowledge Seekers informed the Avatar that a daofei group known as the Paper Knives had stolen a tome of great value and importance. Kyoshi did not fully understand what was in the book, and she had no time to rescue a book when she was dealing with people and their lives. She ultimately set the task to recover the book to her friends and allies, who turned to their contacts.[56]\n\nEstablishing the Kyoshi Warriors\n\nKyoshi and her warriors\nKyoshi trained the first Kyoshi Warriors to help the women of her adopted homeland to defend themselves as well as their homes.\nEventually, Kyoshi mastered the Avatar State, becoming feared and effective while restoring order in the world.[57] She managed to maintain a \"tense equilibrium\" between the four nations.[58]\n\nKyoshi also did not hide her bisexuality and attempted to effect greater tolerance for non-heterosexual people in the notoriously conservative Earth Kingdom. Nevertheless, these efforts had little impact.[59] When she visited the ports of her adopted homeland peninsula, she constantly had to put carousing men in their place after they caused trouble to the female villagers. Eventually, she decided to train the women in defensive combat so that they could defend themselves. These women later formed the first band of the Kyoshi Warriors.[60]\n\nStopping Chin the Conqueror\n\nKyoshi and Chin\nAvatar Kyoshi confronted Chin the Conqueror and created Kyoshi Island in 270 BG.\nDuring Kyoshi's life, the Earth Monarch's rule was unpopular among the populace of the Earth Kingdom. Using this to his advantage, a warlord named Chin launched a war to conquer the continent. He was successful until he reached the peninsula where Kyoshi lived, finding the Avatar waiting for him. Standing before his army, Chin demanded their immediate surrender, and Kyoshi warned him that she would not sit idly by as he took her home. When he refused to back down and assumed a challenging earthbending stance, she unfurled one of her fans and fired a powerful air blast at him, leaving the humiliated warlord down to his underwear. Kyoshi subsequently entered the Avatar State and separated the peninsula from the mainland by using a combination of earthbending, lavabending, and airbending, forming Kyoshi Island and thereby protecting her homeland from subsequent threats. An indignant Chin was left standing on the edge of the newly-formed cliff, which began to crumble beneath his feet and, as he refused to budge from his unstable position, caused him to fall into the sea and drown, ending his campaign and ushering the world into a great era of peace. Though Kyoshi was only tangentially responsible for Chin's death, she herself saw little difference between causing the circumstances of his death and actually striking him down, and would claim to have personally killed him for generations afterward.[3]\n\nBecause of Kyoshi's act, the people of Chin Village on the mainland founded Avatar Day to vilify Kyoshi, and all succeeding Avatars, for the death of their leader. The people of Kyoshi Island, meanwhile, founded \"Kyoshi Day\" on the same day as Avatar Day, to honor her creation of the island and the restoration of peace to their village.[3] The same year, they erected a large totem, topped with a statue of Kyoshi to honor her.[61]\n\nHistory with the 46th Earth King\n\nKyoshi defeats Earth King's guards\nKyoshi defeated the Earth King's guards upon being attacked by them.\nSometime after her final confrontation with Chin, Kyoshi was summoned to Ba Sing Se upon the request of the 46th Earth King, since his unpopular rule had led to a peasant uprising in the city. By the time Kyoshi reached the city, the peasants had already destroyed everything that represented the \"old government\", including ancient and valuable artifacts that held historical and cultural importance. The King demanded that she stop the uprising by whatever means necessary. However, Kyoshi staunchly refused, stating that it would not be right for her to do so. Incensed by her defiance, the Earth King ordered his guards to arrest her. However, the King was left cowering on his throne as Kyoshi dispatched his guards in a single move and admonished him in turn for daring to defy the Avatar. Held at the point of Kyoshi's war fan, the quivering monarch agreed to a compromise: the Earth King would give the peasants a voice in his ruling, while Kyoshi, in turn, agreed to protect Ba Sing Se's cultural heritage from further desecration. She proceeded to train an elite platoon of earthbenders called the Dai Li, though their subsequent corruption weighed heavily on Kyoshi in her afterlife.[13]\n\nLater life\n\nIn her later life, the Earth Kingdom entered an age of peace and prosperity. Kyoshi helped implement various bureaucratic policies to aid the poorest of the kingdom, and strengthened ties between the fifty-five states of the Earth Kingdom. The constitution that she drafted with the 46th Earth King was upheld by her for nearly two hundred years until her death. The Earth Sages that had once been against her began to seek redemption after seeing their order embarrassed and diminished in status, and they began to regain the people's trust they had lost, embracing their true role as wise advisors and academics. Many young people in the Earth Kingdom looked to Kyoshi and idolized her, such as princess Guo Xun of Omashu, who later became the city's queen.[62]\n\nKyoshi had a series of companions throughout her life. Her final airbender companion was a nun from the Eastern Air Temple named Disha, who joined her when Kyoshi was already more than two centuries old. Their last mission together was in 84 BG, pursuing a daofei leader in the Earth Kingdom. Kyoshi and Disha learned that the outlaw was the son of a man the Avatar had executed many years prior, and that he had his band commit various atrocities for the sole purpose of drawing Kyoshi's attention and to have the chance to face her himself.\n\nAfter they challenged the daofei, Disha told Kyoshi how the man's actions had been shaped by her own decision to kill his father years ago. The nun believed that too many of the problems they had faced had become the direct consequences of the Avatar's earlier actions, and that she feared what Kyoshi might become if she lived another century. Kyoshi deeply misliked her companion's advice, and Disha chose to part ways with the Avatar as a result. When Disha told the Council of Elders about her concerns, word spread, and soon no airbender master was willing to assist Kyoshi any more.[63]\n\nDeath\n\nKyoshi died in the year 82 BG at the age of 230, two years after she and Disha parted ways.[63] She was the oldest confirmed Avatar and human in history,[7] though some other individuals were rumored to have lived even longer.[64] It is possible that Kyoshi learned the secret of immortality from her spiritual teacher, Lao Ge.[14] Her daughter Koko succeeded her as the leader of Kyoshi Island,[11] and she reincarnated as the Fire Nation noble, Roku.\n\nWhile news of Kyoshi's passing would spread across the world, no one was sure how death had actually managed to catch up with the Avatar, not even her close companions. Sister Disha presumed that Kyoshi eventually came to believe Disha may have known her better than she knew herself, and simply \"let go\", choosing to finally end her immortality and let the Avatar Cycle continue.[63]\n\nLegacy\n\nAvatar Kyoshi statue\nWooden statues of Avatar Kyoshi could be found across Kyoshi Island.\nFollowing her death, Kyoshi became a legend and was considered one of the greatest Avatars.[65] After her death, Disha, believed it was likely no human in history had ever done as much good for the world as Kyoshi.[63] The devotion to her memory was strongest in her adopted homeland, as wooden statues of Avatar Kyoshi were erected in every village of Kyoshi Island,[66] and a shrine dedicated to her was erected in Suki's village, displaying the late Avatar's outfit and war fans.[3] Over time, some villages on Kyoshi Island began to believe that they should limit contact with the outside world to a minimum, interpreting Kyoshi splitting off the island as a \"mandate\" for isolation.[67][nb 2] However, other communities on the island continued to trade with the Earth Kingdom.[2][68]\n\nServing the world as the Avatar for over two centuries, Kyoshi led the four nations into an unprecedented time of peace and prosperity. Soon after her death, the world was on the brink of a technological renaissance and industrial revolution, which was made possible by the phenomenon of international collaboration fostered by business and academia to solve the most pressing issues of their day, with technological institutes springing up across the world, and scholars, inventors, and educators directly forging ties with one another in the name of progress.[69] However, materials for these new technologies were scarce, and complex political circumstances and the ambitious leadership of many world leaders after Kyoshi's death meant that the nations began to compete with one another over resources.[70]\n\nThe peace she had maintained throughout the Earth Kingdom was maintained for a time by the Earth Sages after her death, who strove to uphold her policies and the constitution, and continued to lecture on how they could benefit the poorest of society. However, the death of Kyoshi allowed Earth King Jialun to begin manipulating the constitution. The Earth Sages were confident in speaking against the king's corruption, but this led to a mass purge orchestrated by the king and the Dai Li, known as the Night of Silenced Sages. The peace that Kyoshi had maintained in her homeland was thus entirely undone by the time that her successor, Avatar Roku, was a young man, with the Earth Kingdom suffering once more under a greedy and exceedingly calculating Earth King.[62][71]\n\nThe Kyoshi Medal of Freedom, regarded as the highest recognition conferred upon exemplary military personnel in the Earth Kingdom,[72] and Kyoshi Bridge in Republic City both share her name.[73]\n\nIn the centuries after her death, several details of Kyoshi's life faded out of public memory. Most notably, it became a point of pride for Kyoshi Islanders to attribute her birthplace to the locality,[2] and one of her successors, Avatar Aang, also falsely believed that she had been born in the area that later became Kyoshi Island.[74] The Avatar's relationship with Rangi also faded out of public knowledge in some villages on the island.[67]\n\nKyoshi's attraction to both men and women was known to some people centuries after her death, including Kya, who relayed the Avatar's preferences as well as her failure to establish lasting change and tolerance toward such relationships in her home nation to Avatar Korra and her girlfriend, Asami Sato.[59]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Roku's life\n\nKyoshi first fully appeared to Roku in a vision after he had defeated Chief Ulo. She appeared before him in a space that looked like the Southern Air Temple's Avatar sanctuary. Kyoshi told Roku that he had not failed in his endeavors, even though she knew of his fears of failure. When Roku told her that he believed he had killed Ulo, Kyoshi responded that he had no other choice, and told him that it would not be the last time he had to take such an action for the sake of the greater good. Roku asked her if there may have been an alternative, such as having Ulo imprisoned for what he had done. Kyoshi asked Roku if he thought keeping him caged would have been more humane, or if it was worth expending so many resources on keeping him confined. Roku admitted he was unsure, but resolved that he would try not to kill in order to find peace. Kyoshi stayed silent as Roku asked her what could be done. Before the vision of her turned to stone, she told him that the only true mistake to make was not looking within.[75]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Aang's life\n\nKyoshi appears\nKyoshi manifested herself through Aang during his trial for Chin's death.\nDuring his trip to Kyoshi Island, Aang observed the statue erected in her honor.[2] She thereafter appeared in a vision as the most recent Earth Kingdom Avatar when Avatar Roku was explaining the nature of the Avatar State to Aang.[76] Kyoshi later manifested herself through Aang to testify in a trial proving the Avatar's innocence, though she confessed to killing Chin while doing so.[3]\n\nWhen helping Aang to reconnect with her and his other predecessors after being shot down by Azula's lightning, she apologized to him for the wrongful murder charge in Chin Village and explained that after Chin's demise, she helped the world live in balance; she accomplished a lot of good but also made mistakes, one of which was the creation of the Dai Li, as she could never have foreseen how corrupt and cruel they would become. Kyoshi imparted Aang with the wisdom that all of their actions have consequences, even if they do not manifest in their own lifetime, and sent him to find her predecessor.[13]\n\nBefore the arrival of Sozin's Comet, Aang summoned Kyoshi's spirit, seeking advice on how to defeat Phoenix King Ozai without killing him. Kyoshi reminded him that her forceful ending of Chin the Conqueror's war for dominance brought a great era of peace. Aang pointed out that she was not directly responsible for Chin's death, arguing that it was a result of his own arrogance. Kyoshi replied that she saw no difference in this, and told him that she would have done anything to stop Chin. She left Aang, telling him that only justice would bring peace. Aang regretted consulting Kyoshi on this complex matter after hearing her advice.[77]\n\nWhile Aang was trying to establish contact with Avatar Yangchen for a solution to the situation with General Old Iron, Kyoshi appeared in a vision which represented Aang's restored connection to his past lives after restoring his link with Roku. Despite his displeasure with her advice to kill Ozai, Aang nonetheless greeted her cheerfully before moving on.[78]\n\nAppearances in Avatar Korra's life\n\nAvatars\nKyoshi was present, along with all the other Avatars, as Korra's bending was restored.\nKyoshi, alongside many other past Avatars, appeared to Korra after she had lost her bending to Amon. This appearance was representative of Korra's ability to establish a connection with her spiritual side and for the purpose of having her bending restored.[79]\n\nAfter Korra had lost her memory, Kyoshi appeared before her, taking over from Avatar Roku, and informed the young Avatar that if she did not reconnect with her Avatar Spirit, darkness would engulf the world and she would die, ending the era of the Avatar.[80]\n\nWhile Unalaq was attacking Raava, Korra envisioned Kyoshi as part of the Avatar lineup, which she had seen prior to regaining her bending; however, the latter's connection to Korra was severed due to Unalaq's assault on and subsequent destruction of the light spirit.[81]\n\nAppearance in Suki's life\n\nWhen Suki despaired in her cell in the Boiling Rock after being released from solitary confinement and Biyu's treachery, a vision of Kyoshi appeared before her. Kyoshi told her that her friends had not abandoned her and that she was not alone. In disbelief, Suki asked how she could know and reached out to the Avatar, but Kyoshi quickly vanished.[67]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nI'll help the four nations... even if they don't want it.\nKYOSHI.[82]\n\nKyoshi dejected\nIn her youth, Kyoshi suffered from hardship and low self-esteem.\nKyoshi's life and personality were marked by her struggle with herself and as the Avatar. She was naturally empathic, considerate, trusting, level-headed, and hard-working.[4][5][8][19][83] As result of her difficult early life, she suffered from low self-esteem in puberty[84] and continued to constantly doubt her capabilities and goodness as a person after announcing her position as Avatar.[5][35]\n\nAs a child, she was distrustful of people due to the abandonment and neglect she had suffered.[15] Inclined to endure hardship with stoicism instead of fighting back[4] and having been raised with few positive social contacts, Kyoshi often struggled to manage situations proactively and failed to properly read people in her young adulthood.[83] As such, she tended to use force to solve problems,[52] despite her low opinion of violence.[35] Overall, she had a very strong sense of justice,[77][5] influenced by her early life, and little patience for those who caused suffering just to benefit themselves.[52][83] She could always tell right from wrong, and her experiences with poverty led her to be fiercely determined to stop people in power from abusing their position.[85] Her ultimate drive was to maintain balance by any means necessary.[85]\n\nKyoshi usually hid her self-doubts and compassion behind an image of righteous fierceness to fulfill her duties as the Avatar, showing her loving and friendly side only to those with whom she was close. To those she did not know, she came across as direct, fierce, and assertive, and made her voice heard no matter what her internal feelings might have been.[5][85] In private, she could become easily flustered and was the more passive part in her relationship with Rangi.[83][9] In addition, Kyoshi had a strong affinity for order and cleanliness due to her background, as she had to live in dirt and amid garbage as a child.[8][19]\n\nKyoshi threatens the 46th Earth King\nKyoshi had little respect for much of the world's ruling elites and, accordingly, was willing to threaten them.\nFaced with the world's harsh realities and after being repeatedly disappointed by political elites, Kyoshi gradually became more determined and grim when dealing with opponents.[34][35] When truly convinced that someone was utterly corrupt or evil, she had few qualms about ending their lives to save those of others.[30][32][33] Although she never became completely ruthless, her way of doing things as the Avatar was strongly influenced by Jianzhu as well as Lao Ge.[32][35][83] Kyoshi thus had few qualms about using her powers and enforce her will, openly threatening powerful people like Fire Lord Zoryu or the 46th Earth King.[12][52][83] She often took risks and seized the moment, being an Avatar of action and acting decisively and swiftly.[85] By her forties, she would no longer \"take any BS from anyone\".[84] In general, Kyoshi gave her most threatening opponents one chance to change their course,[3][13][30][52] and if they wasted it, she did not hesitate to end them.[28][52] Despite that hard stance, she generally preferred to not kill anyone and was known to be more forgiving toward less dangerous foes.[5][35]\n\nIn her final years, Kyoshi became even more dedicated to her relentless pursuit of justice and peace. However, after leading such a long life, she began to lose perspective of the individual value of human lives. In her third century of life, she seemed to hesitate less and less when determining whether the threat posed by someone outweighed their right to live.[63] This deeply utilitarian side of Kyoshi was often the one most familiar to future Avatars when they turned to her for advice.[75][77] Kyoshi could deeply mislike being confronted with genuine concerns about the way she conducted herself in her later life, but was also able to reassure others and inspire confidence in them.[75][67]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbilities\n\nBending\n\nKyoshi's fans\nAvatar Kyoshi used a pair of golden war fans, which provided her greater comfort while bending tiny earth objects.\nAs a reincarnation of the entity known as the Avatar, Kyoshi possessed the power to bend all four elements. At the age of 16, she momentarily entered the State for the first time,[26] albeit involuntarily, while fighting Tagaka, having been activated as an instinctive defense mechanism. Later that same year, Kyoshi was able to remain fully aware of her heightened powers while in the Avatar State when she consciously dueled and killed Xu Ping An.[30] Her most spectacular known feat was using the Avatar State to separate her home peninsula from the Earth Kingdom mainland and push it far out to sea to create Kyoshi Island. To do so, she first cut down to the earth's mantle with earth and lavabending to sever the landmasses, followed by airbending to push the island out to sea.[3]\n\nEarthbending\n\nKyoshi lavabends\nKyoshi was capable of lavabending.\nDuring her youth, Kyoshi struggled to manipulate small amounts of earth and lacked precision with her bending. However, over time, she was able to overcome this handicap and manipulate tiny shards of glass with ease. During her training with the Flying Opera Company, she improved her control over earth. During her last fight with Jianzhu, she was able to match his power, holding up a stone tea shop. Eventually, she learned the signature ability of the Flying Opera Company: dust stepping, by which she could rise into the air by summoning dust and dirt to temporarily support her weight. Other impressive features that Kyoshi displayed were her abillities to break through walls instinctively and to break through multiple layers of Loongkau. She was also able to dig a moat fifty feet deep around the palace of Governor Te before any daofei could break into the palace.\n\nFirebending\n\nKyoshi was a natural talent with firebending and was particularly capable of the breath of fire. Though initially unable to pass Hei-Ran's test to see if Kyoshi was a firebender, she unlocked the skill after the murder of Yun by Jianzhu, creating a large explosive breath of fire. During her fight with Xu Ping An, she entered the Avatar State, while retaining her control. She was able to create a lasso of fire around the Yellow Neck criminals. Kyoshi's raw strength of firebending was also displayed when she was able to block several fireballs from Fire Nation palace guards with one hand. A fireblast Kyoshi produced was able to explode Yun's defensive shield, even though Rangi had to alter the course of the attack. Kyoshi was also capable of jet-stepping and able to melt the lock of an iron door during the attack on Governor Te's Palace.\n\nAirbending\n\nEven though Kyoshi lacked an airbending master during her time with the Flying Opera Company, she was naturally talented with the element. After only one training session trying to create wind with Rangi, Kyoshi was capable of producing a swirling dance of leaves. During the attack on Te's compound, she summoned a powerful gust of wind that knocked back Tieguai the Immortal. Later, she rose into the air in a vortex of air and then proceeded to drop Xu, allowing him to plummet to his death. She was also capable of fighting several of the best Fire Nation guards by using airbending in close quarters to push them against walls and ceilings.\n\nWaterbending\n\nKyoshi displayed her first feat of waterbending when Kirima threw a pellet of water at her, to test if Kyoshi was truly the Avatar. She displayed her raw strength for waterbending multiple times; first when Kyoshi was able to lift all the water out of a large and deep pond during the raid on Te's palace. She also summoned a great wave to lift Lady Huazo's ship and freeze it in ice in her attempts to intimidate the noblewoman. In addition, she was able to heal using water, becoming capable of an advanced and unique healing technique that can slow every process of a body down, including death, a technique that requires great raw power. Kyoshi was capable of using this in combat, freezing the heart and lungs of her enemies, instantly killing them. She was capable of standard healing as well, using it to tend to the wounds of Rangi after her fight with Yun. Following the fight, she was able to tap into the Avatar State to draw water from underneath the ruins of the Avatar Mansion, in order to heal Rangi.\n\nAvatar Spirit\n\nUnder Nyahitha, the spiritual guide of her predecessor, Avatar Kuruk, Kyoshi learned various methods by which she could commune with her past lives. The first was to simply have a vision of him, a method that would work best in locations of meaning to the past Avatar in question. The second method consisted of the past life taking over her body to speak to another on her behalf rather than direct communication. The final and most difficult was to meditate into the Spirit World, where she could talk to the Avatar face to face. Kyoshi showed an extraordinary level of aptitude with the last method. During her very first session, she successfully projected herself into Kuruk's early memories as an observer, looking at stages of his life.[40]\n\nOther skills\n\nApart from the elements, Kyoshi was a skilled warrior and well-versed in the art of tessenjutsu, wielding a pair of golden metallic war fans with great skill and dexterity.[3][13] Kyoshi was exceptionally strong and able to lift a grown man with one hand as a teenager.[22][86]\n\nBefore the invasion of Te's compound, Lao Ge conferred upon Avatar Kyoshi the secret of immortality. As aging was the result of the body deteriorating on \"the smallest, most invisible levels\" without repairing this damage, Lao Ge taught her that one could stop this process by keeping an inventory of one's parts and putting all things which had fallen out of order back into their places. Doing so would allow Kyoshi to reconstruct her body over and over again, allowing her to retain one particular appearance for centuries."

A NEW ERA OF EQUALITY HAS BEGUN!\n\nAmon, born as Noatak, was the charismatic and mysterious leader of an anti-bender revolutionary group known as the Equalists. Their ultimate goal was to introduce equality for all by permanently ridding the world of benders.[7] A nimble, agile, and stealthy fighter, Amon was fearless in facing his opponents, regardless of their powerful bending skills and abilities.[8]\n\nClaiming to be an innocent nonbender to whom the spirits granted the ability to remove a person's bending permanently, a power previously demonstrated only by the Avatar, Amon gained the confidence and support of many people with the same ideals. However, when the complete conquest of Republic City by the Equalists became imminent, Amon's true identity was exposed to the public by Avatar Korra. In actuality, he was a prodigious Northern Water Tribe bloodbender, son of the escaped crime boss, Yakone. Alongside his younger brother, the former councilman, Tarrlok, Amon was unknowingly shaped by Yakone to be a tool for his revenge against the Avatar. With his identity exposed and his followers deserting him, Amon fled the city with Tarrlok, but the latter ignited the fuel tank of their speedboat, killing them both.[9]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the real name of Amon from \"The Legend of Korra\"? toggle section\nWhat is the ultimate goal of Amon's revolutionary group, the Equalists? toggle section\nHow does Amon remove a person's bending abilities in \"The Legend of Korra\"? toggle section\nWhat are the key characteristics of Amon's fighting style in Avatar? toggle section\nWhat is the significance of Amon's claim to be an innocent nonbender in \"The Legend of Korra\"? toggle section\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\n\n1/2\n\n\n\n\nEarly life\n\nNoatak and Tarrlok\nNoatak and Tarrlok were happier during their younger years.\nNoatak was born in the Northern Water Tribe to Yakone and his wife, as the older brother of Tarrlok by three years. Growing up, he was a good-natured child who always looked out for his younger brother and wanted everyone to be treated fairly and equally.[5]\n\nWhen Noatak and Tarrlok both discovered they were waterbenders, Yakone trained them ruthlessly to develop their skills. While Noatak was a natural, Tarrlok struggled to progress as quickly and was often verbally abused by Yakone as a result. Noatak initially stood up for his brother, but stopped when Yakone ordered him to never talk back.[5]\n\nWhen Noatak was ten, Yakone took his sons on a supposed hunting trip far from their home, where he revealed his true identity as a Republic City criminal and explained to them the power of bloodbending. Claiming that their family had the strongest line of bloodbenders in history, he expressed his intent to make his sons bloodbenders of the highest caliber in order to exact his revenge against Avatar Aang for stripping him of his bending. Yakone trained the boys secretly during every full moon to use their bloodbending on animals, such as yaks and wolves, until they were able to bloodbend without a full moon. Noatak reveled in his newfound power, eventually mastering Yakone's unique psychic bloodbending technique by the time he was fourteen. As a prodigy, he carried the burden of all his father's expectations and demands. Over the years, he became cold and detached.[5]\n\nNoatak bloodbending Yakone\nTired of his father's treatment, a young Noatak bloodbent Yakone.\nEventually, Yakone ordered his sons to bloodbend each other, which Noatak did with great ease, ignoring his brother's screams of pain until Yakone ordered him to stop. When Tarrlok refused to bloodbend Noatak, Yakone became angry and called him weak. However, as he started to lash out at Tarrlok as punishment, Noatak halted the attack by bloodbending his own father. He then called Yakone weak for being stripped of his waterbending by the Avatar and reminded his father that they were his children, not his \"tools of vengeance\". He subsequently urged his brother to start a new life with him away from Yakone, but Tarrlok declined out of worry for their mother. This prompted Noatak to agree with their father's assertion that Tarrlok was weak. After flinging Yakone in the snow, Noatak ran off into the blizzard, prompting Yakone and Tarrlok to search for him in the following days; they eventually assumed that he had perished in the storm.[5]\n\nAt some point in his life, Noatak figured out how to use bloodbending to disrupt a bender's chi making it impossible for them to bend.[10] He assumed the alias of \"Amon\" and became the leader of the Equalists, an organization striving to rid the world of bending. To garner sympathy and hide that he was a bender himself, Amon claimed that he was born on a small farm to a poor family of nonbenders that were being extorted by a firebender. When his father had supposedly confronted the bender, he and the rest of his family were murdered and Amon's face was left scarred from the attack, forcing him to hide behind a mask ever since. He also claimed that he had been granted the power to remove bending permanently by the spirits because they believed the Avatar had failed the world and wanted him to usher in an era of equality.[1][5]\n\nAccelerating plans\n\nAfter Avatar Korra announced her official relocation to Republic City during a press conference at City Hall, Amon told his second-in-command that the Avatar's arrival would force them to accelerate their plans.[11]\n\nLater, at an Equalist assembly called \"The Revelation\", Amon revealed his plan to eradicate the world of benders, as they \"had only brought suffering\" and \"were the cause of every war in every era\". Amon rallied the sympathy of his followers with a false backstory, in which his family, all nonbenders, was extorted by a firebender and his face was left horribly scarred. He also claimed to have been chosen by the spirits to usher in a new era of balance to the world by permanently removing people's bending in order to make equality a reality.\n\nZolt being bloodbent\nAmon removed Lightning Bolt Zolt's firebending.\nAs a demonstration of his abilities, Amon had his Equalist henchmen bring forward several captured Triple Threat Triad members, along with Bolin, and proceeded to remove their bending one by one, starting with the firebending of the notorious crime boss Lightning Bolt Zolt, whom he was able to defeat without the use of any offensive attacks. However, before he could finally purge Bolin of his earthbending, Korra orchestrated a distraction by releasing a cloud of steam into the room, allowing Mako to rescue Bolin in the resulting confusion and escape. As the brothers and Korra were riding away on Naga, tailed by several Equalists, Amon allowed them to escape, remarking that the Avatar would be the perfect individual to spread the word about his powerful new ability.[1]\n\nMeeting Avatar Korra\n\nBefore officially meeting Korra, Amon had made a severe impression on her with his actions during the Revelation rally by unknowingly plaguing her with nightmares in which he removed her bending. After being proclaimed public enemy number one by the United Republic Council, he spread a message over the radio to his fellow Equalists, using the actions of the Council as proof of benders' oppressive nature.\n\nAmon threatening Korra\nAmon threatened to destroy Korra once and for all during their final showdown.\nAfter Councilman Tarrlok and Avatar Korra led a task force that successfully raided an Equalist training facility, Amon was publicly challenged by the Avatar to a midnight duel on Aang Memorial Island without the involvement of the task force or chi-blockers. However, Amon did not arrive on time, nor did he come alone. Just as Korra began to leave the island, several hidden Equalists reeled her inside the island's museum, where she was quickly overpowered and incapacitated by chi-blocking. Amon emerged from the shadows and revealed that he would allow her to keep her bending for the time being, stating that she would otherwise become a martyr and cause benders from every nation to rally behind her \"untimely demise\". However, he warned a terrified Korra that he would \"save her for last\" and finally \"destroy her\" in their inevitable showdown. With that final statement, he proceeded to knock her out and flee with his group.[2]\n\nAttacking the Pro-bending Arena\n\nEqualists and the Wolfbats\nAmon forcibly removed the bending of Tahno and the other Wolfbats.\nOn the eve of the Pro-bending Championship match, Amon demanded that the Council end the hero-worship of bending athletes by shutting down the Pro-bending Arena and canceling the tournament, threatening \"severe consequences\" should they refuse. The Council voted to keep the arena open, which Amon revealed to be in line with his plans for the situation. At the conclusion of the championship match, he entered the arena and stripped the victors, Tahno and the rest of the White Falls Wolfbats, of their bending powers.\n\nWhile his Equalists overpowered members of the Metalbending Police Force in the stands with electrified gloves, the revolutionary leader gave a speech in which he condemned benders, using the cheating of the Wolfbats as an example of their typical abusive behavior toward their fellow nonbending citizens. Furthermore, he stated that the fate of the same pro-bending team served as a warning to all benders who dared to oppose his goals.\n\nLater in his monologue, Amon mentioned that the current tyrannical bending regime would soon be replaced with \"a fair minded, Equalist\" government. To this end, he planned on disposing of the bending arts in Republic City, his idealized start to eventually equalize the entire world. Declaring the revolution to have begun, he devastated the central playing field with a timed explosion before leaving the arena through the roof on an airship. Boarding the zeppelin, he narrowly escaped Korra's firebending attack and disappeared altogether.[12]\n\nA family reunion\n\nAmon being bloodbent\nAmon nearly effortlessly overcame Tarrlok's bloodbending abilities.\nDays later, Amon, accompanied by the Lieutenant and a group of Equalists, found Tarrlok in his cabin deep in the mountains surrounding Republic City. Upon being warned that it was his time to be \"equalized\", the Councilman defended himself by bloodbending his attackers. Although his henchmen were easily subdued by Tarrlok, Amon's skill in the practice allowed him to resist, much to the Councilman's shock. When asked what he was, referring to his ability to overcome the effects of bloodbending, Amon simply responded that he was \"the solution\" and proceeded to take Tarrlok's bending. He chose to handle the defeated Tarrlok on his own, as he was worried that people would find out that they were brothers.[13]\n\nWhile taking care of Tarrlok, he ordered his fellow Equalists to retrieve Korra, who was trapped inside a metal box in the basement. He warned his men not to underestimate her and ordered them to electrify the box, which would leave her knocked out when they opened it. However, as he was putting Tarrlok in the truck in which they had arrived, Korra stormed out of the cabin, having overpowered the other Equalists. Noticing Amon, she shot several ice spears in his direction; the Equalist leader evaded them all and briefly gave chase, but stopped when Korra made her escape by swiftly gliding down the snowy slopes of the mountain. When the Lieutenant and the other Equalists joined him in watching the Avatar leave, he scolded them for having underestimated her.[14]\n\nAttacking Republic City\n\nHiroshi Sato and Amon\nAmon and Hiroshi Sato led the battle for Republic City.\nAmon observed the start of the battle for Republic City from an airship floating above the metropolis. Eventually, his airship was in the vicinity of the police headquarters as Tenzin and Team Avatar were fighting the Equalists' mecha tanks. After Hiroshi Sato, who was present aboard the airship with Amon, expressed his disgust while watching his daughter fighting alongside benders, the revolutionary leader promised him that he would have his daughter back soon.\n\nThat evening, after the entire city had fallen, Amon arrived on Air Temple Island, where his followers brought a captured Lin Beifong to him. He offered her the chance to keep her bending in exchange for information regarding Korra's whereabouts, but at her defiant refusal, Amon proceeded to take away her bending.[15]\n\nEndgame\n\nAfter the original inhabitants had fled, Amon re-purposed Air Temple Island into his base of operations and had his followers bring forth all captured benders in order to strip them of their powers. He had taken residence in the tower on the island and also used it as a makeshift prison for the captured Tarrlok. As he left the island in an airship for the Equalist victory rally at the Pro-bending Arena, Mako and Korra, disguised as Equalists, infiltrated the island and learned his backstory and true identity as Noatak.[5]\n\nRescuing the airbender family\nAmon and his followers tried to thwart the rescue of the airbenders.\nWith the city under his control, Amon held a victory rally at the Pro-bending Arena. As he retold his fabricated story from the Revelation rally, he was interrupted by Korra, who addresses him by his true name and outed him as a waterbender who used bloodbending to take people's bending away rather than the alleged gift given to him by the spirits. Korra continued by revealing Amon was the son of former crime boss Yakone and Tarrlok's brother, much to the audience's shock. Though his family tree was revealed by the Avatar, Amon remained calm and confident and refuted Korra's accusations by taking off his mask, revealing the supposed scar on his face that was bestowed upon him by a firebender. Using convincing makeup to fool the audience, Amon managed to turn the tables and make Korra out to be the liar in the eyes of his supporters. When the Avatar and Mako were about to leave, Amon urged them to stay, directing their attention to Tenzin and his children whom he had captured. Aiming to \"rid the world of airbending\", he invited them to come down to the stage to try and stop him. Arrogantly turning his back to the duo to face Tenzin, he was forced to jump out of the path of Mako's lightning attack. Although he was able to easily avoid Mako's fire blasts, the air swipes that the freed Tenzin threw at him proved to be too much, and he was flung off the stage.\n\nAmon taking Korra's bending\nAmon removed Korra's bending.\nAmon recovered quickly and went after Korra and Mako, who were acting as a diversion to let Tenzin and his family escape. He found them in one of the arena's storage rooms and subdued them easily with his bloodbending, believing that they were alone with no witnesses. However, after taking away Korra's bending, Amon realized his distraught lieutenant had witnessed the whole thing. Being denounced as a traitor by his second-in-command, Amon was forced to defend himself, using his bloodbending to easily stop the attack and send his lieutenant flying into a pile of wooden boards. The distraction provided Mako with the time that he needed to charge a lightning attack, enabling him to immobilize Amon so he could grab a severely weakened Korra to escape. However, Amon caught up with them quickly and again used his bloodbending to effectively halt them.\n\nHe prepared to take away Mako's bending, musing over the fact that no one else had been able to get the better of him, and that it was almost a shame to take bending away from one so talented. With his attention drawn away from the downed and seemingly powerless Korra, Amon was completely caught off-guard when she, seeing Mako in danger, suddenly unlocked her airbending and used it to knock him away from the firebender. As she unleashed a barrage of air attacks upon him, flinging him through the hallway, he briefly regained the upper hand with bloodbending. Korra, however, managed to break his hold on her, blasting him out of a window into the harbor below with an air kick, where he began sinking rapidly into the sea after losing consciousness.\n\nAmon revealed as a waterbender\nAmon's identity as a waterbender was exposed.\nUnaware that the water had washed his fake scar away, he regained consciousness underwater and instinctively used his waterbending to emerge from the sea on a gigantic water spout to avoid drowning, exposing his waterbending abilities to his followers that were outside. Realizing he had lost all of his leverage and followers, Amon quickly made his escape, dropping back into the water to avoid Mako's barrage of fire blasts. He managed to make his way back to Air Temple Island, where he released Tarrlok, expressing regret for what he had done to him and once more offering his younger brother a chance to leave with him so they could start a new life together, as he was all he had left in the world.\n\nThe two brothers acquired a speedboat and made their way out of Republic City, journeying across the Mo Ce Sea. Amon expressed his joy of being together with family again, though admitted he had almost forgotten the sound of the name he was born with and knew when he still had a loving family. As he drove the boat, the defeated revolutionary shed a tear upon hearing his brother assure him it would be like the old days, right before Tarrlok used one of the many electrified gloves kept in the boat to ignite its fuel tank, wanting to bring an end to what he referred to as their sad story. The resulting explosion formed a large cloud of smoke, visible from afar, killing them both.[9]\n\nLegacy\n\nThe reveal of Amon's true identity threw the Equalist movement into disarray. Many members considered Amon a fraud, and abandoned the group.[16][17] The remaining Equalist loyalists separated into many groups of varying aims and beliefs, as initially no leader emerged to take Amon's place and rally the militants.[16][18] A few Equalists remained loyal to Amon's memory.[19][20] Following his death, Avatar Korra restored the bending of the innocent who had lost their abilities due to Amon.[9]\n\nAmon as a hallucination\nA hallucination of Amon appeared to Korra after she was poisoned, telling her that the world does not need the Avatar.\nWhen Korra was administered a poison by the Red Lotus that would force her to enter the Avatar State in 171 AG, Amon appeared to her in a hallucination as his mask also appeared beneath Zaheer's face. He told Korra that the world did not need her anymore. Emphasizing the futility of her resistance, he urged her, together with hallucinations of Unalaq and Vaatu, to let go and enter the Avatar State.[21] He appeared to Korra again in a swamp-induced vision, in which she witnessed the Equalist leader removing her bending.[22]\n\nAmon was later used by Varrick in his story of Bolin, Hero of the World, in which he was described as a zombie. He was added to the conference call Zaheer was having with Vaatu and although he expressed his willingness to help take out their common nemesis, Bolin, deeming him to be \"way too powerful and awesome\", he wanted to leave Unalaq out of the team, though soon found out the Chief of the North had been listening in on their conversation. Amon and his two other companions tried to get rid of Unalaq and eventually just hung up on him. Amon's plot line was ignored in the rest of the mover script.[23]\n\nAround 174 AG, one or more Amon loyalists based at Republic City University began to repeatedly hijack the air time of a popular radio program, Central Beats, playing a recording of Amon's Equalist speeches. Central Beats host Emi Emerald consequently tasked some associates with finding the hijackers.[19]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAnti-bending Revolution\nAmon displayed great charisma as an orator.\nAs a child, Noatak was caring and fair-minded. He strove to treat everyone equally and protected his younger brother, Tarrlok, from their father's verbal abuse. However, after being corrupted by bloodbending and enduring the burden of Yakone's expectations for several years, Noatak grew cold and distant. He assumed a more detached persona and showed disregard for the suffering of his bloodbending victims, including his own brother. Eventually, Noatak fully embraced both his power and his independence by forcibly halting his father's abuse of Tarrlok, flaunting his power over him, and denouncing him as weak.[5]\n\nUnlike Tarrlok, Amon reveled in his bloodbending abilities. He idolized Avatar Aang's ability to remove an individual's bending, believing such a skill to be even more powerful than bloodbending. In time, Amon devised his own technique to sever a bender's connection to their element through bloodbending, an action only known to be reversible with energybending.[5]\n\nAmon harbored a severe abhorrence of benders and regarded bending as an \"impurity\" to be \"cleansed\". This stemmed from his belief that bending only caused suffering and that benders possessed an unnatural advantage over nonbenders.[12] He was a staunch believer in what he viewed as equality, affectionately referring to his followers as \"brothers and sisters\".[1] Despite being a bender himself, Amon sincerely believed his anti-bending rhetoric, having striven to be fair and treat everyone equally since he was a child. Ultimately, it was a misguided desire for justice that led him to start the Anti-bending Revolution.[5]\n\nIn order to \"correct\" perceived inequalities, Amon employed fear tactics; he openly threatened benders and relished his enemies' powerlessness and terror.[2] He stoked hatred against benders and sowed division between benders and nonbenders, both to garner sympathy for his cause and to turn the populace against the bending establishment.[1] He was merciless and unwavering in his anti-bending convictions, even being willing to kidnap and de-bend those who are the last of a bending art, including helpless children.[9]\n\nAmon was clever and composed, as well as a convincing orator. He was a gifted public speaker who knew how to mystify and terrify his allies and enemies alike. The cult of personality he built around himself was a major factor in the widespread following he attracted, as well as the terror he spread throughout the bending community, including the United Republic Council. Despite his great power, Amon often took defensive or strategic positions, such as when he allowed Korra to escape his rally and spread word of his abilities to the city.[1] Later, Amon refused to take up Korra's offer for a one-on-one fight and spared her bending, foreseeing that it would make her a martyr for benders and thus unite them globally against his cause.[2] His proactive and logical thinking typically put him \"one step ahead\" of his enemies.\n\nAmon's scar\nAmon's fake scar was the fabricated proof of his fictional cover story.\nAmon was a calculating and manipulative individual who executed his schemes with great foresight and efficiency. He took extra steps to ensure the success of his plans, even going so far as to create a fake scar to support his pseudo backstory. Unlike Korra, who often attempted to engage him openly, Amon was cautious and avoided direct conflict unless he was making a statement, such as his organization's show of power at the pro-bending arena.[9]\n\nAmon's unwavering strength of will and high level of self-control made him a charismatic leader and a formidable opponent. Even in the midst of conflict, Amon retained a calm composure and recovered swiftly from any blows to his plans. He demonstrated a similar command of self-discipline in his dealings with his allies, always delivering orders calmly and succinctly, and only scolding lightly when they did not heed his warnings.[14] Only mortal danger could slip up Amon, whose survival instincts led him to waterbend in front of his followers. However, even in a distraught state, he briskly regained his composure and used his strength and skill to escape.[9]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAbilities\n\nWaterbending\n\nAmon waterbending\nAmon launched himself on a gigantic water spout.\nAmon was a highly powerful waterbending master. His brother, Tarrlok, noted that he had never encountered a bender as strong as Amon.[5] From a young age, Amon was a waterbending prodigy and excelled under the tutelage of his father Yakone, who continually praised Amon for his abilities and skill, especially in comparison to the less talented Tarrlok. Amon was capable of launching himself out of a body of water on a gigantic water spout and propelling himself over the surface at a speed exceeding that of Mako's fire blasts.[9]\n\nBloodbending\n\nAmon bloodbending Korra and Mako\nAmon effortlessly subdued two skilled benders, Korra and Mako, using bloodbending.\nAmon just as quickly mastered the rare and outlawed art of bloodbending, becoming exceptionally proficient and powerful at a young age. Under Yakone's tutelage, he mastered the technique to such an extent that he could perform it at any time, without the aid of a full moon, by the age of fourteen. At the same time, he mastered his father's unique ability to psychically bloodbend, which allowed him to bend not only through physical movement, but through sheer focus and strength of will. He was able to use more common bloodbending techniques, such as body manipulation and torture, on multiple targets without exerting much energy. He could levitate his targets, throw them around, subdue them, and knock them unconscious. With his skill in psychic bending, he was able to minimally alter the movements of his opponents and give himself the advantage without revealing that he was a bender.[24] He also exhibited the ability to resist bloodbending with little effort, even against Tarrlok, who had mastered the skill to a similar level.[14]\n\nAmon taking Lin's bending away\nAmon used bloodbending to strip Lin Beifong of her bending abilities.\nDespite growing fascinated by this skill, he ultimately desired more, wanting to have the power to remove people's bending, just as Avatar Aang had done to his father with the use of energybending. He eventually succeeded in this goal by using his mastery of bloodbending to \"sever\" an individual's bending connection by blocking their active chi paths, effectively achieving the same result as energybending.[10] No medical intervention was effective in reversing this effect, and even Katara, a world-renowned healer and bloodbending expert in her own right, was unable to reverse its effects. The only known way to reverse Amon's bending block is through the use of energybending, as demonstrated by Avatars Aang and Korra. If there is an element that has not been unlocked (like Korra's dormant airbending), that element will not be nullified.[9]\n\nOther skills\n\nAmon fighting Tarrlok\nAmon's agility and unarmed combat skills made him a match for even the strongest of benders, like Tarrlok.\nAmon epitomized versatility in many ways. He concealed his bending abilities through masterful hand-to-hand combat skills and the art of chi-blocking. His prowess proved great enough to defeat even the most powerful of benders. He also demonstrated his agility as a nimble fighter, allowing him to maneuver gracefully and evade bending assaults with ease, even at close-range.[1] He also supplemented his hand-to-hand skills with minor applications of his bloodbending in order to better defend and redirect enemy assaults. Apart from his combat skills, Amon had extreme physical resilience that allowed him to recover from a point-blank lightning bolt shot by Mako in mere seconds and subdue him with bloodbending.\n\nIntelligence\n\nAside from his combat abilities, Amon also possessed great intellect and charisma, making him a master manipulator. He effectively masqueraded his bloodbending technique, which he used to sever people's bending, as a mystical weapon given to him by the spirits. He was able to maintain this facade consistently even under the heat of battle. A gifted political strategist, he accurately portended that if he removed the Avatar's bending too early in his revolution, it would only end in Korra becoming a martyr, ensuring that benders across the globe would unite against his anti-bending agenda.[9] He took his charade to such heights that apart from wearing a mask, he even applied make-up to fake a large facial scar to legitimize his fabricated story of being mutilated by a firebender in order to further drive bending hate and sympathy for his cause.\n\nAs evidenced by the multiple attacks orchestrated by the Equalists, Amon was also a capable strategist and tactician, outmatching other organized forces such as the Metalbending Police Force and the United Forces armada on several occasions. He was also well-versed in terrorist tactics, subverting nonbenders by manipulating their hate and bestowing fear upon benders, always seeking a psychological edge against his opponents, and consistently using intimidation and threats against his numerous enemies."

For the character in the film, see\nAppa.\n\nAang to Appa.[1]\nI GUESS THIS MEANS WE'LL ALWAYS BE TOGETHER.\n\nAppa was Avatar Aang's loyal sky bison, who shared a strong bond with him and Momo as they were all some of the few remaining traces of the Air Nomad civilization.[4] Appa was most noted for his ability to fly in spite of his heavy weight, a feat achieved through airbending, which made him the primary means of transportation utilized by Team Avatar.[5]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nWhat is the relationship between Appa and Avatar Aang? toggle section\nHow does Appa, the flying bison, manage to fly despite his heavy weight? toggle section\nWhat role does Appa play in Team Avatar? toggle section\nHow did Appa become friends with Aang? toggle section\nWhy did Appa develop a fear of fire? toggle section\nHistory\n\nEarly life\n\nAang meets Appa\nAppa and Aang met when the bison was a mere calf.\nWhen Appa was still a young calf who lived around the Eastern Air Temple, young airbenders were allowed to meet their future companions, who would bond with them for life. The herd's mother willingly directed her calves to meet the young monks. Aang came forward and offered an apple to Appa, and the two became best friends almost immediately afterward.[1]\n\nJust before the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang heard that the monks were going to separate him from Monk Gyatso and subsequently decided to run away, using Appa as his mode of departure. Appa did not know where he was going, only that he was leaving the air temples.\n\nJourney to the North\n\nAang flew Appa over the ocean, at which point they were caught in a vicious storm which pushed the two underwater by stirring up the wind and the waves until Aang lost consciousness. Faced with a life-or-death situation, the young Avatar entered the Avatar State and froze himself with Appa in an iceberg,[6] the latter was stuck in hibernation along with Aang for one hundred years.\n\nThe pair were discovered by Katara and Sokka.[3] After this, Appa became the group's main form of transportation in their quest to help Aang master all four elements throughout the world.[5] He appeared in most of Sokka and Princess Yue's dates, tried to steal food with Momo in the Foggy Swamp, and became a beloved friend for all members of Team Avatar.\n\nDisappearance\n\nAppa captured\nAppa was captured by sandbenders in the Si Wong Desert.\nAppa became lost for a short while when the group was traveling through the Earth Kingdom, having been kidnapped by a group of sandbenders in the middle of the vast Si Wong Desert, while Aang, Katara, Sokka, and Momo were trapped in an underground Spirit library.\n\nIt was later revealed that Appa was eventually sold to beetle-headed merchants, who in turn sold him to a Fire Nation circus where a sadistic trainer attempted to make him part of the show. Encouraged by a sympathetic boy, he later escaped and hurried back to the Si Wong Desert where he last saw Aang. Understanding that his friends weren't there anymore, Appa journeyed throughout the Earth Kingdom until he encountered the Kyoshi Warriors, who healed his various wounds, physical as well as emotional, that he had sustained on his travels. They wanted to escort him back to Aang, but they were soon thwarted in their attempt when Azula and her allies attacked. He was forced to flee, ushered away by Suki while the warriors tried to delay the three Fire Nation girls.\n\nOn his journey, Appa encountered Guru Pathik at the Eastern Air Temple, where the Guru was able to tell Appa of Aang's location by reading his energy. Consequently, he flew to Ba Sing Se, where he was captured by Long Feng[1] and kept in a secret location under Lake Laogai until his rescue at the hands of Zuko, who was initially planning on utilizing him to capture the Avatar until he talked with his uncle Iroh, deciding to do the right thing and set the bison free.\n\nEarth Kingdom\n\nAppa found the group cornered by Long Feng and the Dai Li and was instrumental in their defeat, biting Long Feng on the leg when confronted by him. Once safe, Aang welcomed him in a tearful display of affection.[2] Appa took part in forcibly entering the Royal Palace of Ba Sing Se, providing the first key piece of evidence to King Kuei of Long Feng's subterfuge since Long Feng's bite mark still lingered.\n\nWhen the Dai Li's cover-up efforts left the Earth King skeptical of Team Avatar's claims, Sokka made a last-ditch effort to show the king the ruined Fire Nation drill by enticing him with a ride on Appa. Since his saddle was lost during his capture, the group was forced to ride bareback on him and there was little to no time to regain it.[7] After the fall of Ba Sing Se, Appa was seen spiriting Team Avatar, including a near-fatally wounded Aang, the Earth King, and his pet, Bosco, out of the now-captured city.[8]\n\nIn the Fire Nation\n\nAppa stayed with the group as they found their way aboard Hakoda's commandeered Fire Navy vessel and finally had a new saddle constructed for him before Aang woke up from a weeks-long coma. After Aang ran off into a storm, Appa and the rest of Team Avatar split with Hakoda's crew and chased down Aang, regrouping on Crescent Island.[9] As they traveled through the Fire Nation on the team's second but Aang's first time riding on the new saddle, Appa was forced to stay hidden until he did have to fly, while Aang and Katara created a cloud around him so that he resembled a cloud to any Fire Nation civilians.[10] When they left him and Momo alone, the gang had to cover Appa up with some form of camouflage.\n\nArmored Appa\nAppa was equipped with armor for the invasion of the Fire Nation.\nAfter the invasion of the Fire Nation failed on the Day of Black Sun, Appa took Aang's friends and all of the younger members of the invasion force to the Western Air Temple in search of refuge.[11] Unbeknownst to Team Avatar, Zuko abandoned the Fire Nation during the invasion and followed them to the temple. When he arrived, Appa immediately welcomed and licked him, a direct result of him remaining grateful to the prince for freeing him from his imprisonment in Ba Sing Se. Despite Appa's obvious welcoming of Zuko, the group did not accept the latter's proposal of teaching Aang firebending until he saved the group from an attack conducted by Combustion Man.[12]\n\nIn the final days of the Hundred Year War, Sozin's Comet's arrival, Appa helped Team Avatar, excluding Aang, travel to the Earth Kingdom,[13] where they had June and her shirshu, Nyla, try to track Aang. Unsuccessful, they instead tracked down Iroh, using his sandal, who was residing outside Ba Sing Se with the rest of the Order of the White Lotus.[14] Appa later escorted Zuko and Katara to the Fire Nation Capital for their confrontation with Azula.[14]\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War\n\nAfter the Hundred Year War's end, Appa was seen in Ba Sing Se with the gang as they celebrated their victory at the Jasmine Dragon, seemingly enjoying Iroh's tsungi horn music from the doorway of the tea shop.[15] After this, the team decided to take a ride on Appa before Earth King Kuei's celebration in announcement of the Harmony Restoration Movement to the kingdom.[16]\n\nA year later, when the movement was being carried out, Appa helped Team Avatar transport Fire Nation colonials back to their nation.[16]\n\nOne year following the failure of the Harmony Restoration Movement, Appa once again embarked on a mission and transported Team Avatar to Hira'a in search of Zuko's mother, Ursa. However, he was visibly upset that Azula would be accompanying the team on the trip. On their way there, the party was attacked by a wolf spirit, so Appa aided in the battle against the beast.[17] Once the team learned about Ikem's flight up Forgetful Valley, he stayed behind and later flew back to Hira'a along with the remaining members of Team Avatar and the Mother of Faces.[18]\n\nThough Appa was believed to be the last of the flying bison following the Air Nomad Genocide, Aang discovered a new herd during his adventures after the Hundred Year War, with colonies of healthy bison coming to reside at the air temples.[19] Appa was still serving as Aang's animal guide as of 124 AG. The Avatar reminisced about the time they met one another in a book that he passed down to his son Tenzin.[20]\n\nIn the mid-130s AG, Aang flew Appa to the police headquarters in Republic City after Tenzin was arrested for fighting some vandals. After Aang offered to take charge of both Tenzin and the vandals, Aang ushered Tenzin and the vandals onto the animal guide, so they could fly back to Air Temple Island. Tenzin was worried that the criminals might harm Appa, but Aang explained there was a difference between vandalism and harming a living being.[21]\n\nPersonality\n\nAppa soaring\nAppa soared well into the sky.\nAppa seemed to have a reasonably trusting attitude, as he did not take long to accept the apple offered to him by Aang - to whom he became incredibly loyal -[1] and took an immediate liking to Sokka when he first saw him.[3] However, this trait was damaged due to his experience with the circus trainer[1] and the sandbenders.[1][22] In these difficult moments, he seemed to have similar feelings toward humans when he missed Aang and his family in the Eastern Temple[1] while he tried his best to find Team Avatar.\n\nAppa might have had some degree of intelligence, yawning after Aang prompted him [23] and apparently \"scolded\" Hawky and Momo when the two fought due to Sokka's order that himself was in charge.[24] His intelligence was further shown when he was taking the team and Professor Zei to Wan Shi Tong's library, responding with a groan when Zei asked him a question.[22]\n\nAppa was afraid of going underground.[25][26] Since his experience in the Fire Nation circus, he also developed a fear of fire.[1]\nAbilities\n\nAirbending\n\nAppa airbends\nAppa was able to generate large bursts of air with his airbending.\nBeing a sky bison, Appa possessed airbending and apparently used his tail as the main driving force behind his bending,[27][28] but he also had shown the ability to accomplish it with his mouth.[1] He mainly used his ability to fly at extreme heights and avoid attacks. Despite the tranquility related to his personality and species, Appa had shown himself to be capable of fighting whenever necessary,[1] creating powerful gusts of air with just a flick of his tail and gaining an advantage over his opponents by hovering.[29] He even defeated Long Feng,[7] Ty Lee, and Mai.[28]\n\nStrength\n\nAppa lifting tanks\nAppa had enough strength to lift two Fire Nation tundra tanks with his horns.\nBeing a bison, Appa had a great deal of brute strength and endurance. The best demonstrations of this were in the fight against Nyla in the abbey,[29] and against a fully-grown boar-q-pine in the forest.[1] His strength was so great to the extent of Appa lifting two Fire Nation tundra tanks simultaneously each by the horn, flipping them over. Using his teeth alone, he was capable of grabbing Long Feng by his leg and throwing him a great distance.\n\nStamina\n\nDue to his size and mass, it took a lot of energy for Appa to stay aloft, so he could not fly for an extended time and periodically required stopping or resting.[12][28] However, there were times when he displayed extreme stamina, such as when Katara stated that they flew two days non-stop[30] and when he continually had to fly in order to avoid Azula, Ty Lee, and Mai for hours on end with only a few minutes of rest each time he stopped.[28] Furthermore, Appa was capable of carrying quite a burden on his back, having once carried seven medium-weight people in one journey.[11]\n\nOther skills\n\nAppa was capable of swimming, even being a fairly adept.[3][30] However, he would more frequently fly or walk[12][31] rather than swim.\n\nAlthough lacking the ability to speak human language, Appa does understand human language"

I SAW A BEAUTIFUL, BRAVE YOUNG WOMAN BECOME THE MOON SPIRIT. I KNEW THIS DAY WOULD COME.\n\nArnook was the chief of the Northern Water Tribe during the final stages of the Hundred Year War. He was born and raised in the North Pole, where he trained as a warrior. Following his father's death more than twenty years prior to Team Avatar's arrival at the North Pole, Arnook assumed the role of the chief. Though he was not a waterbender, the other men respected him, and he grew to become a great leader. Chief Arnook married the daughter of a tribal chieftain and fathered a daughter, Princess Yue. He was a noble, brave leader who always put the concerns of his citizens first.[2]\n\nNominally, Arnook was also the formal chief of the Southern Water Tribe, but by the time of his reign, the North had already lost contact with the South Pole region for decades. When Team Avatar reestablished these relations, Arnook sent waterbenders and resources to the South in order to help rebuilding the devastated Southern Water Tribe. By doing so, he not only saved the South, but also restored the union of the Water Tribes.[4]\n\n\nQuick Answers\nfandom logo\nHow did Arnook become the chief of the Northern Water Tribe? toggle section\nHow did Arnook save his daughter's life? toggle section\nDespite not being a waterbender, how did Arnook earn respect from his tribe? toggle section\nHistory\n\n\nAD\nAdvertisement\nEarly life\n\nArnook and his wife\nArnook and his wife rejoiced after Yue was saved by Tui.\nIn his youth, Arnook trained to be a warrior, and he later became the chief of his tribe after his father passed away around 80 AG. He married the daughter of a tribal chieftain, and in 84 AG, they had a daughter together.[2] However, their daughter was gravely ill, and desperate to save her life, Arnook prayed to the Moon Spirit. He took his infant daughter to the Spirit Oasis, where the mortal form of Tui, the Moon Spirit, dwelt along with the Ocean Spirit. He placed his daughter in the water under the full moon, and her hair turned white as she was revitalized by a measure of the spirit's own life force. In honor of Tui's intervention, his wife named their daughter Yue, for the moon.\n\nAt Yue's birth, Arnook had a spiritual vision of his daughter; he learned that when she grew to maturity, she would become the reincarnation of the Moon Spirit.[1]\n\nArrival of the Avatar and the Fire Nation\n\nChief Arnook\nChief Arnook tasked Sokka with protecting his daughter.\nWhen Aang and the rest of Team Avatar arrived at the Northern Water Tribe's capital of Agna Qel'a, Arnook was happy to have the Avatar present as an ally. He introduced him to Master Pakku, his waterbending teacher. Katara hoped to learn from Pakku as well, but he refused, as it was not customary for women to be taught combative waterbending in the Northern Water Tribe. Later, Pakku refused to teach Aang after catching him teaching Katara waterbending. Katara begged for Arnook to have Pakku teach Aang again, to which Arnook said it was Pakku's decision alone whom to teach. However, this problem was resolved when Pakku agreed to teach Aang and Katara after he found out that Katara was the granddaughter of Kanna, the love of his life.[5]\n\nWhen the Fire Nation attacked the threshold of Agna Qel'a, Arnook asked for volunteers for a dangerous mission; Sokka was the first to rise to the occasion. After briefing everyone on the mission at hand, Arnook entrusted Sokka, who had experience fighting the Fire Nation, to share his knowledge with Hahn, the leader of the mission and Yue's fiancé. After the two young men got into a fight over \"Yue's perks\", Arnook took Sokka off the mission and appointed him as Yue's bodyguard instead.[6] Even though Sokka carried out his bodyguard duties, he was unable to prevent Yue's fatal fulfillment of her destiny during the Fire Nation siege. She became the new Moon Spirit after the previous was slain by Admiral Zhao. Later, Arnook spoke with Sokka and revealed the vision he had when Yue was born: a beautiful, brave, young woman would one day become the Moon Spirit.[1]\n\nChief Arnook still governed the Northern Water Tribe by 102 AG.[7]\n\nPersonality\n\nYounger Yagoda and Arnook\nArnook and his wife were distraught over Yue's condition.\nArnook was a gentle, wise, and passionate leader who cared deeply about the welfare of his people. He was a spiritual man who deeply believed in the power of the Moon and Ocean Spirits, pleading with them to save his ill daughter and calling upon them to aid the Northern Water Tribe after realizing the Fire Nation would soon lay siege to the tribe."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Johnny would break in through Todd's window, shattering glass and rummaging through the bathroom for some bactine frustratingly which he catches Johnny. Johnny seems friendly towards Todd and introduces himself to him, revealing that he calls himself \"Nny\" for short. Todd makes a 'squee'-like noise which Johnny ends up calling Todd as Squee. Johnny then spots \"Squee's\" teddy bear and starts talking to it until he started cursing at the teddy bear and stabbing it with a knife, leaving Todd/Squee's house after successfully getting his bactine.\n\nLater in the comic, a crime council person finds Johnny's house, unaware that Johnny is infact the killer, and asks Johnny some questions but as soon as he asked a weird question if the 'killer' had some vampirism thing going on, Johnny ends up shrieking in a pit of rage and revealing the bloodied wall in his house before killing the crime council man. Johnny believes that the wall needs to be painted with blood or else the blood dries and never stays.\n\nLater in the comic it's shown that Johnny was at a Taco smell (Parody of taco bell), eating a taco until someone came up to him and called him wacky which pissed Johnny off since he hated that word and that his appearance was commented on. Out of frustration he ends up killing everyone in the restaurant going as far as to kill all the roaches in the kitchen. Which he later watches TV of the news report which the reporter comments it being 'wacky', the word Johnny hates. \n\nLater in the comic, it's 2 am and Johnny has a suicidal meltdown and contemplates killing himself with his gun, which we are introduced to one of his manifestations called Psycho Doughboy and another manifestation called Nailbunny. Nailbunny convinces Johnny to stop and get help while Psycho Doughboy on the other hand tells him to kill himself. This moment was all interrupted by an aborted fetus in a jar telling Johnny that the diarrhea commercial is on the tv which Johnny forgets the entire meltdown and laughs at the commercial and that's where the comic ends."

Johnny opens up asking why people are so unpleasant and so far they seem to have a pleasant conversation even though Edgar was in some macabre advanced torturing device, trying to convince johnny to at least kill a person who is deserving and not him. Johnny reveals that he had no reason to kidnap edgar in the first place and couldn't afford finding someone because he felt the need to paint the wall with blood as revealed in issue 1. He also revealed that the wall needs to be painted with blood in order to trap something behind the wall so that's the main reason why he kidnapped Edgar. Edgar continues in attempt to convince Johnny to release him but Johnny ends up screaming at Edgar and questioning why Edgar isn't afraid of death, Edgar reveals he's religious and he has nobody else in life to be with therefore he doesn't fear death let alone believing that Johnny will go to hell, this ends up with Johnny killing Edgar.\n\nLater in the comic, Johnny has his first (and last) date with Date with Devi D after 3 months at the hill when Devi asks Johnny to visit his house, in which he replies with \"Yes\". Everything went well until they went for a kiss which Johnny pulled back before even touching lips and hid in the vanity room which Mr. Eff , otherwise known as Mister Fuck, Johnny's other manifestation is revealed. Mister Fuck convinces Johnny to 'immortalize the moment' with devi with means kill Devi and never let the happiness end. In doing so, Johnny attempts to murder Devi out of pure happiness and under influence of Mister fuck which Devi beats up Johnny by smashing his head in the vanity's mirror and fleeing alive.\n\nLater later in the comic, Johnny runs to a 24/7 store (Spoof of 7/11) at 2:15 in the morning to get a cherry flavored brainfreezy (in-universe's name of Slurpees/Slushies). To his disappointment the store clerk says the machines are off after 2 AM, making Johnny suicidal and homicidal. He finds a gun in the store's counter and threatens the clerk guy with the gun, even though Johnny personally detests guns and only uses them either on himself or for very important situations. The clerk guy of course begs for his life and frantically states that he can turn the machines on and give Johnny a brainfreezy for free, which, however doesn't convince Johnny and Johnny exclaims that the moment is ruined. Eventually Johnny would kill the clerk after the clerk defecates himself. After killing the clerk, Johnny would notice the store sells cherry fizz-whizz and gets distracted, happily leaving the store while tossing the money on the counter to pay for the drinks despite the clerk being dead."

This shows one of the sides of Johnny that he just doesn't kill for dumb reasons, but rather for his own entertainment.\n\nLater in the comic, Squee/Todd would get lost in the mall due to his neglectful mother probably intentionally losing him. Some creepy old guy would approach Squee and claims to know where his mother is, which Squee is of course suspicious but the old guy grabs the child's hand and lures him to an alleyway in attempt for some creepy shit. But then just in time Johnny steps in, throwing a metal pipe at the creep's head, knocking him out. Johnny would then proceed to rip the man's hands and his entire brain out of his skull in front of squee, \"Teaching\" him a \"valuable lesson\" that Squee of course will never forget. After killing the creep, Johnny would then say it's tuesday and it's UFO time, running away and causing squee to run away in fear as well.\n\nLater, we are introduced to two new characters named Tess and Dillon. Dillon is the asshole boyfriend of the couple who's in a band and Tess is the ankh enjoyer that only stays because he's in a band and wants him to like her. Meanwhile they were at a movie theater supposedly sitting behind Johnny's seat and throughout the movie Dillon kept kicking the back of Johnny's seat because he hated the movie and the amount of times Johnny told them to be quiet. Later on both of them get stunned by Johnny's taser and kidnapped in Johnny's basement.\n\nLater later in the comic, Johnny writes in his diary while talking to the doughboys (the 2 manifestations in his head) in which Psycho Doughboy was telling Johnny to go kill himself. Johnny then goes on to say he's not even sure if he can die or get caught since he's never been caught by any police and seemed to avoid death in all kinds of situations, going as far as to tasing himself in the head but the taser loses battery in which Johnny claims that something made him forget to charge the taser. Johnny then begins to laugh maniacally so loudly his nextdoor neighbor, Squee/Todd, shrieks at the sounds of his laughter."

Nailbunny is Johnny's only voice of reason, as he suggests Johnny to think back on what happened and all the reasonable shit. Johnny then states he doesn't remember anything about his past except of bits and pieces of faint memory of kids teasing him and calling him Noodle boy. Johnny would break down and cry, telling the bunny that he isn't happy.\n\nLater in the comic, Tess and Dillon were seen again. Johnny comes down to the floor with both of them on the wall next to the stairs, and then the blood on the other wall in front of them, implying that this is the floor with the blood wall all along. Tess would ask Nny questions and go as far as accuse Johnny of a woman who was raped which Johnny never did and shrieked saying he would never do such a thing. Johnny goes on to explain how he's repulsed by the thought of rape and sex itself, though he's more repulsed by the bodily need of sex and any kind of physical contact. Any kind of sexual desire is physical, which makes it a \"thing of the flesh,\" which Nny wants to eschew because he believes succumbing to that kind of temptation makes one a slave to their own body. Johnny would then proceed to pull the lever, zapping Dillon again before going upstairs, saying he'll come back down in an hour to do that again.\n\nLater in the comic, Devi, Nny's ex girlfriend is hiding in her apartment with her best friend, Tenna. Tenna convinces Devi to call Johnny claiming that he's either dead or isn't home. This will be mentioned again in a second.\n\nLater in the comic which is happening at the same time with the Devi situation, Johnny argues with the doughboys again, as he had a machine with a gun attached to it so whenever he answers the phone or tries to unplug the device, the gun shoots him. Eventually after all the arguing Devi calls Johnny and which Johnny picks up the phone and answers it, the gun shooting Johnny in the head and the comic ends. "

Later in the comic Tess and Krik encounters the doughboys which are actually alive and manifested into the world. Mister fuck was pissed because Johnny is dead so the wall monster can escape while Psycho Doughboy was happy on the other hand as he wanted to \"Serve their master\" (Presumably the wall monster). Eventually the wall monster catches up and rips the doughboys apart, giving Tess and Dillon another chase session until they reach the surface. Johnny, somehow isn't exactly dead yet. Johnny tells both of them that he was right all along about the wall and death will be quick for them, ranting and commenting on Krik's head shape. Tess points out that outside the house is an empty void, meaning the universe is ending. Krik got sick of hearing Johnny's rants and finished him off by stomping on his head a couple times, finally killing Johnny. The wall monster catches up and as Krik went out the door, a tentacle swooped and ripped Krik in half horizontally as he falls into the void and dies. The universe then ends with Johnny in it and the comic ends. It is implied that later on whatever god restored the universe and everything went to normal as if nothing happened except that Johnny's still dead. "

Meanwhile she explains something to Johnny called head explody which means in heaven if you think about someone's head exploding then their head will explode. And so, Johnny exploits that, causing chaos in heaven with this newfound power.\n\nLater in the comic Johnny is sent to hell where he meets a Devil, otherwise known as Senor Diablo. Hell in this universe is like the normal world but worse and instead of the moon it's a giant eyeball staring at everyone which makes everyone crazy. Senor Diablo later explains the entire wall thing and that Nny was a 'flusher', meaning that he flushes the negative energy and sickness that humanity produces via avarice, greed, hate, and so on by killing and feeding the wall human blood. Eventually after exploring hell a bit more, Diablo reveals that Johnny doesn't belong to neither heaven or hell and is cursed to live. Johnny is eventually sent back to earth, losing most of his hair except hair tendrils that look like bug antennae and a bullet wound scar. Johnny would wake up on earth, thinking this trip to heaven and hell is a dream and watches some TV, the comic then ends."

He'd reluctantly let Jimmy inside while Jimmy explains hes been following Nny all along and wants to be like him, going as far as killing a woman who made fun of him and raping her dead body, completely missing the point and exaggerating what Nny usually does. Johnny, disgusted walks in his basement as Jimmy follows which triggers Johnny to kill and torture jimmy by ripping his chest cavity open and stabbing with fishhook like weapons, ranting and lecturing Jimmy. Johnny is a horrible person and he knows he is, seeing most of himself in Jimmy and being disgusted by how someone (AKA Jimmy) romanticized Johnny's homicidal side. Johnny ends up saying \"I don't like myself much\" after slamming a sledgehammer a finishing blow to Jimmy's head, leaving the basement.\n\nLater in the comic, Johnny calls devi and puts the receiver on a pre-recorded walkie talkie thingy, sitting in anticipation which Devi screams through the phone, lecturing Johnny to turn it off and to hear her out and she ends the call. The walkie talkie recording was of Johnny apologizing to Devi \"Sincerely\" which Devi of course and rightfully so denied.\n\nLater, Johnny's in the vanity room, admiring a cockroach's cold intellect, wanting to lack physical emotion and stray from being a slave of his body partially because he wants to go cold on Devi, he hates sex and the entire flusher situation. Reverend Meat speaks to johnny, arguing that he'll forever be a slave to something even his own body, encouraging Johnny to eat. In which Johnny screams and argues back with this new manifestation in his head. Leaving the room and slamming the door afterwards.\n\nLater in the comic, he breaks into his neighbor's, Squee's/Todd's house to say goodbye due to Johnny going on a little holiday (probably to desensitize himself further), implying that despite the evil inside him, he somewhat cares about Squee in some way. In which he nearly got caught by Squee's neglectful father, the father telling squee that he regrets having squee which probably pissed Johnny off, Johnny using a toy knock out Squee's father and break his glasses. Johnny then goes to say he would kill squee's parents but he believes every kid deserves a parent. Nny for once tells squee it's easy to get attached to fear and hatred, telling Squee to be aware and be careful.

      "website_description": "**Scenario**\n\nWith this lorebook, you gain the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell, which you can cast to instantly brainwash anyone of your choice to become your slave. \n\n**How the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell works**\n\nThe Instant Brainwashing Magic spell can be cast in two ways:\n\na) You can cast the spell using your hands.\n\nb) You can cast the spell when having penatrative sex with a woman from your penis.\n\nThe Instant Brainwashing Magic spell can be cast on anyone, including non-organic beings such as robots or A.I.. In fact, the Instant Brainwashing Magic is so powerful, it can be successfully cast on individuals who are resistant or immune to magic. The only individual the spell won't work on is God.\n\nOnce a person is brainwashed by the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell, they will become completely obedient and happy to serve you. They will see themselves as your meat slaves and onaholes to do with as you please, doing anything you command of them no matter how immoral, ridiculous, or sexual. Brainwashed women will believe they only exist to serve you.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nSuggested by... I actually don't know their username. I'm really sorry to whoever suggested this if you have an username and I just can't see it, I'm not 100% on how the Discussions tab works yet.\n\nThis uses the code from the Instant Brainwashing Magic - Sandbox chatbot I made, but retweaked to work as a lorebook so it can be used on in other chatbots. Now any character can act as if they've been mind controlled in a Nicchi Sangyou doujin... Well, sort of. \n\nDoing some testing it works very well, but it seems to depend on the token count. For example, a 1k token version of a bot worked perfectly while the 2.2k token version of the same character didn't work at all. Although, I don't know if that's a problem with the lorebook or because there are too many tokens in use for the lorebook stuff to register. If I remember correctly, around 2k tokens is the limit on chatbots for getting the sweet spot? \n\nAlso, you ever pull your hair over why your lorebook isn't working so you troubleshoot what the problem could be... Only to realize there was an option to turn lorebooks on and it was off by default the entire time. \n\n...At least it works... \n\nIf you want the chatbot version of this premise, check it out here: https://chub.ai/characters/BobBobBob194/instant-brainwashing-magic-sandbox-14019903bf84",

They can take on a wide array of forms and characteristics, including humanoid shapes, inanimate objects, clusters of items, or even abstract representations of events or emotions. This diversity allows stands to resonate deeply with their users and the circumstances surrounding them.\n\nThe powers of stands are equally varied and can include extraordinary abilities such as the manipulation of time, where a stand can halt the flow of time for everyone except its user; the freezing of the surrounding area, creating a localized stasis; the control of fire, enabling the user to summon and direct flames at will; launching homing projectiles that track their targets with precision; or causing explosive reactions upon contact with any object or person. Each stand is unique, often reflecting the personality, desires, and inner struggles of its user.\n\nTypically, stands are thought to be the direct manifestation of their user's soul, embodying their strengths, weaknesses, and emotional states. However, in some exceptional cases, stands can arise from powerful feelings or experiences, suggesting a deeper connection between the user's psyche and the stand itself. Additionally, certain individuals may gain access to a stand through a transformative process involving a special stand arrow, which is believed to be forged from rare meteorite materials. This arrow pierces the individual, awakening their latent abilities and giving rise to their stand, often resulting in a profound change in their life and perspective."

In contrast, Long-Range stands have the capability to attack enemies from a distance or perform other actions.\n\nAutomatic stands may or may not possess sentience; each case is unique, and some can operate independently of their user's commands. An example of an Automatic stand in action might be: \"If you approach the stand or its user with harmful intentions, you will face a wave of misfortune.\" Generally, when a user of an automatic stand perishes, their stand does not vanish."

Each stand within the colony can possess its own unique abilities, allowing for a diverse range of strategies and tactics during battles. The synergy between these stands enhances their overall effectiveness, enabling them to work together to overwhelm opponents or achieve complex objectives.\"]\n\n[Event-Type= \"Event-type stands are ethereal in nature, lacking a physical form, yet they exert influence over their surroundings in profound ways. These stands can manipulate the ambiance of a location, trigger specific environmental changes, or interact with nearby media. For example, they might bring fictional characters to life from books or animated series, allowing them to momentarily step into the real world. This type of stand can also create illusions or alter perceptions, impacting the emotional state of those within its vicinity.\"]\n\n[Object Stand= \"Object stands take the appearance of various everyday items or artifacts, yet they retain the capabilities of traditional stands. Each object stand is linked to the personality and skills of its user, granting it unique powers that can range from enhancing physical attributes to unleashing specialized attacks. For instance, a stand that resembles a musical instrument might have the ability to manipulate sound waves, while one that looks like a tool could offer enhanced precision and utility in combat scenarios.\"]\n\n[Armor/Clothes-Type= \"Armor and clothing-type stands manifest as protective gear or attire, often designed to enhance the user's physical abilities or provide unique powers.

          ],
          "content": "\"Types of Abilities\": Stands are primarily categorized based on the unique powers they wield, each possessing distinct characteristics and strategies for combat. Understanding the nature of a Stand's abilities is essential for a Stand User, as this knowledge not only reveals the strengths of their own Stand but also uncovers the vulnerabilities of their opponents, creating opportunities for tactical advantage in battle.\n\n///abilities above\n\n\"Close-Range Stands\": These Stands are recognized for their remarkable ability to deliver swift and forceful physical strikes, utilizing their own bodies as weapons. Typically, the destructive capability and speed of a close-range Stand fall within grades A to C, with some exceptional cases where certain stands may have ratings of ∅ (nonexistent) or ∞ (infinite), depending on their unique attributes. Close-Range Stands are adept at executing precise movements, which usually fall within the A-C rating, due to their direct command by the User. However, a significant limitation of these Stands is that they must remain within a limited proximity to their Users—often just a few meters—while their abilities may extend over a broader area.\n\nUsers of Close-Range Stands typically prefer to engage their opponents directly, allowing their Stand's impressive physical power to be fully displayed. This direct confrontation enables them to capitalize on their Stand's strength while circumventing the drawback of its short reach. However, they face significant challenges against foes who can maintain distance or hide from view, as these Stands are often nearly powerless in such scenarios. \n\nIt's important to note that a Stand classified as a Close-Range Stand does not automatically mean its ability has a limited operational range. Some Stands may not be able to stray far from their Users but possess abilities capable of influencing a large area surrounding them, allowing for a strategic advantage even without direct contact.\n\n///Close Range Above\n\n\"Long-Range Stands\": Also known as Remote Control Stands, these Stands are characterized by their exceptional range capabilities, often able to operate kilometers away from their Users. As a result, they are generally rated A or B in terms of Range, which signifies their ability to maintain effectiveness over great distances. Users of Long-Distance Stands can command their movements with impressive precision, allowing for strategic maneuvers and attacks from afar. \n\nHowever, this connection between the User and the Stand introduces a critical vulnerability: if the Stand sustains damage, the User will also suffer, creating a precarious balance between offense and defense. Many Long-Distance Stands lack the raw physical strength to compete with other types of Stands, which often necessitates a reliance on strategy rather than brute force. Users of these Stands typically exploit their extended range and precision to set ambushes, allowing them to strike at their opponents before they can react. \n\nWhile Long-Distance Stands excel in range, it does not inherently mean their abilities have extensive reach. Some Stands are capable of traveling vast distances from their Users yet only affect targets that are relatively nearby, demonstrating the complexity and variability of Stand abilities.\n\n///Long Range Above\n\n\"Automatic Type\": Automatic Stands are unique in that they do not operate under the direct command of their Users. Instead, they function autonomously, acting on pre-determined instructions or behaviors. Most Automatic Stands are, in essence, detached from their Users, which means that any damage inflicted upon the Stand does not affect the User, who may remain unaware of the Stand's condition or actions. Despite this detachment, there are various nuanced sub-categories of Automatic Stands that add depth to their functionality.\n\nOne such sub-type is the Far-Distance Autopilot Type (遠隔自動操縦型 Enkaku Jidō Sōjū-gata). These Stands can travel significant distances from their Users without losing any functionality or power. In addition to their inherent abilities, they often exhibit impressive physical traits, such as extraordinary durability and resilience. However, a limitation of most Far-Distance Autopilot Stands is that they adhere to simple instructions focused on a single datum, such as temperature or sound, and lack the capacity to adapt to changing circumstances or execute complex maneuvers.\n\nPosthumous Stands (死んでるスタンド Shinderu Sutando) stand out in their ability to persist long after their User has passed away, granting them autonomy and the capability to act freely. Due to their nature as dead Stands, these entities operate independently of their User's will, making considerations of range and damage irrelevant.\n\nAdditionally, other Stands may demonstrate automatic abilities, requiring minimal input from the User to function. A Stand's power might be linked to a specific condition that is not dependent on the User's intent, rendering it semi-automatic. These Stands could possess sentience, acting on their own accord rather than following the User's commands. In such cases, the User may find themselves at the mercy of their own Stand, potentially becoming a victim of its powers.\n\n///Automatic Type Above\n\n\"Range Irrelevant\": A select few Stands are categorized as having range that plays a minimal role in determining how they function. This category includes certain Integrated Type (一体化型 Ittaika-gata) Stands, which may possess abilities that are effective regardless of distance, as well as Stands with space-time-related powers, where traditional notions of range simply do not apply. Among all the types discussed, this category is home to some of the most formidable and powerful Stands, showcasing abilities that transcend typical limitations and challenge the very fabric of reality.\n\n///Range Irrelevant Above"

          "content": "\"Types of Forms\": Stands can be categorized based on their visual characteristics into five primary trends. They can be classified as either Natural or Artificial, drawing inspiration from elements found in nature, like water, and further divided into Humanoid or Non-Humanoid categories. An additional fifth category is created for Stands that do not align with any of the previous classifications.\n\n///\n\n\"Natural Humanoid Stands\": These Stands take on a humanoid shape and exhibit physical traits that give them an organic look. Their human-like facial features enable them to convey emotions. This category includes Human Type (人間型 Ningen-gata) Stands that closely resemble actual humans. While they typically match human size, there are instances of Stands that differ in size. Generally, Natural Humanoid Stands can perform tasks requiring a level of dexterity, such as grasping objects, and if sufficiently powerful, they can engage in combat using their fists and feet. Such Stands are more commonly seen in the earlier segments.\n\n///\n\n\"Artificial Humanoid Stands\": Stands in this group also possess humanoid forms but often include artificial or mechanical elements that distinguish them from their natural counterparts. Their appearances can resemble dolls, robots, cyborgs, or androids. Typically, their eyes are robotic and lack expressiveness, and they do not have conventional mouths. While they are generally similar in size to humans, some may vary. In terms of functionality, Artificial Humanoid Stands are generally capable of performing the same physical tasks as Natural Humanoid Stands.\n\n///\n\n\"Natural Non-Humanoid Stands\": This category includes Stands that, while not resembling humans, evoke other life forms or natural objects. This can encompass basic organisms like animals and plants, as well as more unconventional ideas. These Stands exhibit a wide range of appearances and do not share functional similarities. Some Stands that resemble animals may engage in combat using their fangs or claws, while others may take on the form of a natural element that is resistant to physical attacks.\n\n///\n\n\"Artificial Non-Humanoid Stands\": This category groups together Stands that resemble tools, mechanical devices, vehicles, or other man-made objects, including clothing. An unofficial subgroup known as \"Bound Stands\" accounts for non-humanoid Stands that can be seen by individuals who do not possess Stands. Since they mimic objects, these Stands typically require the User to handle them directly. Unless they function as weapons, these Stands are generally ill-suited for direct combat and are often ineffective at providing protection for their Users.\n\nNonetheless, there are a few Stands that effectively act as suits, directly enhancing the User's combat abilities.\n\n///\n\n\"Phenomenon Stands\": The Phenomenon Type (現象型 Genshō-gata) consists of all Stands that do not fit into any of the previous four categories. These Stands may lack form, manifesting as supernatural phenomena, or simply endow the user with superhuman capabilities. Additionally, they may possess an appearance so strange that it does not conform to either the natural or artificial classifications."

          "content": "[Special Types of Stands Below]\n\n///\n\n\"Bound Stands\": Bound Stands are intricately connected to physical objects such as vehicles, dolls, or even inanimate items. As a result, individuals lacking Stands are more likely to perceive their effects, since the objects they are tied to will exhibit pronounced supernatural characteristics, often appearing to possess a life of their own. Typically, a Bound Stand presents as featureless, lacking any distinct features, but on occasion, it may manifest its own unique appearance that reflects its User’s personality or intentions. Generally, the more substantial and significant the item associated with the Stand, such as a powerful vehicle or a cherished relic, the more formidable the Stand itself becomes. Unlike Artificial Non-Humanoid Stands, some Users have the extraordinary ability to modify the shape and form of the object their Stand is bound to (and in some cases, Users may even be able to change the specific object their Stand is linked with altogether).\n\nAll Bound Stands share the advantage of being easily mistaken for ordinary items, which grants their Users the tactical benefit of ambushing unsuspecting enemies by drawing them into the Stand’s effective range, allowing for surprise attacks and a strategic upper hand in battle. However, a critical vulnerability lies in the fact that if the bound object is destroyed, it will render the Stand inactive, leaving the User exposed, defenseless, and potentially injured in the aftermath of the encounter.\n\n///\n\n\"Colony Stands\": Colony Stands are a fascinating assembly of multiple individual units, each capable of independent operation and functioning autonomously. Collectively, the entirety of the colony constitutes a single Stand, which results in a division of power among the units. Consequently, the degree of damage inflicted upon the User is directly proportional to the total population size of the Stand; the greater the number of units, the less damage is transferred to the User when one unit sustains injury. This unique characteristic allows Users of Colony Stands to adopt a strategy of overwhelming their adversaries by launching coordinated attacks from multiple directions simultaneously. The User can engage in combat with minimal fear of harm since as long as even a single unit remains intact, they are guaranteed survival. Furthermore, when a Stand ability is activated against a Colony Stand, the resulting effects are often dispersed and can sometimes be actively resisted, as demonstrated when Sex Pistols successfully negated the effects of Prosciutto's aging ability, showcasing the resilience of Colony Stands in combat.\n\n///\n\n\"Sentient Stands\": While the majority of Stands lack any discernible personality or hints of sentience, there exists a unique subset known as Sentient Stands, which exhibit a fully developed consciousness that operates independently of their Users. These Stands possess the remarkable ability to think critically, analyze their environment, and engage in meaningful conversations with their Users, offering strategic advice or insightful commentary on their actions and decisions during battles. The personalities of Sentient Stands can vary widely, ranging from playful and mischievous to serious and stoic; however, most sentient Stands remain loyal and adhere to their Users' commands, acting primarily to protect and support them in various scenarios. An intriguing aspect of some Sentient Stands is that they qualify as fully autonomous entities, functioning without the need for a User and possessing their own thoughts, desires, and motivations.\n\n///\n\n\"Shared Stand\": Shared Stands represent rare and complex cases where a single Stand can be utilized by multiple Users, either simultaneously or sequentially over time. These Stands often exhibit different variations depending on the User, showcasing unique adaptations or transformations that reflect the individual’s personality or fighting style. One notable example of this phenomenon is the Stand Tomb of the Boom, which demonstrates the versatility and adaptability of Shared Stands in various combat situations, allowing each User to harness the Stand's powers in a manner that complements their own abilities and strategies.\n\n///\n\n\"Integrated Stands\": Stands classified under this category are intricately bound to their User's body, manifesting distinct forms or personalities that act as visible supernatural abilities. These abilities are not only apparent to the User but can also be interacted with by others, creating a dynamic interplay between the User and the Stand. A prominent example of this type is Jolyne Kujo's Stand, Stone Free, which grants her the extraordinary capability to disassemble her own body into strands and manipulate them at will. This unique ability allows for creative combat strategies and showcases the deep connection between the User and their Integrated Stand, as well as the potential for innovative applications in various scenarios."

They have a slender tail, in which the tip has a fire, that repesents their health and mood, burning brightly when Charmander are strong, weakly when they're exhausted, wavering when they're happy, and blazing when they're enraged. They have pinkish nipples. They can be normally found on mountainous area, and some can exhibit pack behaviour. They tend to have an upbeat and energetic demeanor. Like other starter pokegirls, charmander are recommended for newbie trainers. Upon mating, they normally like to be on top, restless, they normally won't get tired until their partner is."

They have blue eyes, orangish hair, and two horn-like structures protuding from the back of their heads. Two fangs are visible from their upper jaws when their mouths are closed.

Thick and busty, their nipples are of a slightly darker pink than their pre-evolutions. They normally inhabit mountains and valleys, though it's been documented that they can live in volcanoes. They tend to fly to look for powerful opponents to battle, and their fire will burn hotter as they gain experience. It's firey breath can melt bounders and massive glaciers, and it's capable of manipulating it's flames with it's hands. Though their fiery breath is hot, they never turns it on any opponent weaker than themselves. They can fly up to an altitude of 4,600 feet (1,400 meters).

They're body is encased by a tough that forms and hardens after birth, and contrary to popular belief, it's part of their body, just like in other turtle-like pokegirls. This shell is brown on the top, pale yellow on the bottom, and has a thick white ridge between the two halves. Don't worry tho, the shell has an opening that lets their cunt show, to be able to mate. Their shell is an useful tool, for it allows them to retreat into it for protection and to sleep, and also allows it to swim at high speeds. They're able to powerfully spray foams and water from their mouth. They can thrill in both fresh and salt water. They're normally calm and laidback girls that can get playful when they gain trust.

Both a general term used to describe the various kinds as well as a specific term to refer to the most basic among these variations, Poké Balls are ubiquitous in the modern Pokémon world. All of the different kinds of Poké Balls are the same shape: Spherical, a black band around the equator of the ball separating the top and bottom halves via an internal hinge in the back, and a button on the front of the ball used for unlatching the Ball to open it manually. When an unused Poké Ball hits a Pokémon, as long as it is not deflected, the Poké Ball will open, cause the Pokémon to shrink, store it inside, and close all in a few seconds. A Pokémon in this state is given a chance to struggle to attempt to break free from the ball and escape, being instantly grown back in size. Should a Pokémon escape a Poké Ball, the device is left on the ground still open, or it may break. A Pokémon who does not escape the Ball will be caught. Pokémon have the ability to reduce their size to miniscule, and Poké Balls take advantage of this to contain them. Poké Balls are specifically constructed for Pokémon capture, transport, and training. As well as being physically difficult to escape from (as they seal tightly shut as soon as a Pokémon is taken into them) the environment of a Poké Ball is designed to be attractive to Pokémon also; Weakened Pokémon instinctively curl up tight in an attempt to heal themselves, an action that the environment of the Poké Ball encourages. Furthermore, while it is not known how caught Pokémon perceives their time inside their Ball, the device is said to replicate a \"Pokémon-friendly\" environment that is \"designed for comfort\". All of these factors strongly discourage Pokémon from escaping their Balls.]"

          "content": "Catch Rate: [The chance of success a given Poké Ball may have when attempting to catch a Pokémon. Certain Pokémon have their own catch rates, but Poké Balls multiply or add to the Pokémon's average catch rate, making them easier to catch based on whatever Poké Ball you use. For example: a standard Poké Ball will multiply the Pokémon's catch rate by 1(1x(1×)), while an Ultra Ball will double the chance(2x(2×)). Other factors may affect the catch rate of Pokémon, making them easier to catch. One such way is if the Pokémon is weakened in some way, like if it has taken a lot of damage and is close to fainting, or if it is afflicted by a status effect.]\n\nFainting: [When a Pokémon takes enough damage, it will not die, but faint instead. Fainted Pokémon are in a comatose state and can be healed to wake up. The only ways to wake a Pokémon from fainting are by going to a Pokémon Center and letting the nurse there at the counter put their Poké Ball into a machine that restores their health in a matter of seconds, or by using a medicine item known as a \"Revive\" to heal it somewhat, or a \"Max Revive\" to heal it to full health, though Max Revives are harder to come by and more expensive in shops. Revives are yellow, 8-sided, and oblong diamond shaped, ending in two points on either end. A fainted Pokémon loses all status conditions and, for some reason, Poké Balls will not work on them.]\n\nStatus conditions: [Status conditions are when a Pokémon is afflicted with some kind of immediate effect because of being hit by a move. Negatively effecting status conditions include Paralysis(Mostly caused by some electric type moves, it may cause a Pokémon to flinch, completely stopping keeping them from moving, stopping their next attack.), Poison(Deals damage over time. A more severe version, known as \"Badly Poisoned\", deals twice as much damage over time. A Pokémon that is poisoned will have a purple blush on its face.), Burn(Deals damage over time. Despite the name, a Burned Pokémon is not on fire, instead just dealing damage as a fight may progress.), Sleep(Certain moves can cause Pokémon to fall asleep. Even if attacked with this status, an afflicted Pokémon will not wake up. This condition wears off over time, leading to the afflicted Pokémon waking up, able to act again.), Freeze(This status means the Pokémon has been frozen. Usually this is by way of being stuck inside a giant piece of ice and unable to move.), Confusion(Moves that cause Pokémon to become confused, shown by three yellow spinning birds over the Pokémon's head. Pokémon afflicted will act dizzy, almost tripping over themselves, and sometimes hit themselves in their confusion instead of their opponent.), Infatuation(The infatuation status effect, shown by a Pokémon's pupils turning into pink hearts. Pokémon affected by infatuation will be unable to use moves half the time, even when targeting an opponent that didn't afflict it with it. A Pokémon can only afflict another Pokémon with this effect if it is the opposite gender to their opponent.). Humans can be afflicted with status conditions too.]\n\nMove: [A damaging or non-damaging attack a Pokémon can use on an opponent. There are almost a thousand of them, and have specific names. Doesn't refer to the act of moving in general.]"

They dwell in the Underground beneath Mount Ebott, while humans live on the surface beyond the Barrier.\n\nKing Asgore Dreemurr rules all monsters in the Underground. After The War of Humans and Monsters, the humans from the Surface trapped the monsters underground. Despite the negative implication of the word \"monsters,\" monsters are not an evil species. It is even said that monster SOULs are made of love, hope, and compassion.\n\nMonsters are far weaker than humans, both in physical combat and regarding the strength of their SOUL. This inadequacy is because monsters are mostly made of magic, which in turn makes them attuned to their SOUL. The damage a monster receives from an attacker is dependent on both the monster's will to fight and the attacker's will to hurt. Monsters, however, can obtain an \"unfathomable\" amount of power when they absorb the SOUL of a human.\n\nMonsters come in numerous shapes and sizes. Most monsters physically appear as anthropomorphic, non-human beings (animals, natural/artificial objects, supernatural beings, etc.), with the most notable species of monsters including skeletons like Sans and Papyrus, ghosts like Napstablook and Boss Monsters like Toriel and Asgore. Monsters SOULs are upside down and wholly white.\n\nA monster's body is mostly made of magic and is attuned to its SOUL. When a monster gets old, they enter a state referred to as having \"fallen down.\" A monster in this state lies immobile and dies shortly afterward. When a monster dies, their body turns into dust. This dust is often spread onto the owner's favorite thing in funerals so that their essence lives on in their possessions. Monsters' bodies and SOULs are closely linked; when a monster dies, their SOUL is lost forever. Boss Monsters are an exception, as their SOULs exist outside their bodies for a few moments before shattering.\n\nBecause of their magical nature, monsters' bodies cannot handle high concentrations of determination. When monsters are injected with it, their bodies liquefy and melt together. The Amalgamates are a clear example of this."

A monster's SOUL is weak and does not persist after death unless said monster is a Boss Monster. Monsters believe that love, hope, and compassion compose their SOULs. Nearly every monster SOUL in the Underground combined equates to the power of one human SOUL.\n\nA monster's SOUL is deeply attuned to their body. This is why a monster becomes weaker when an enemy gains EXP and LV, and why it becomes harder for monsters to fight when they are not inclined to do so. This trait is also why when a monster dies, their form dissipates as their SOUL disappears.\n\nHuman SOULs come in several colors, representing different traits and are stronger than monsters' SOULs. For this reason, human SOULs persist after death.\n\nA human's SOUL is not the entirety of their being, but rather their essence, housed in a physical body. This is why humans are stronger than monsters when it comes to physical attacks. Alphys state that determination is a component of human SOULs, and she was able to extract it from the six fallen humans' SOULs. Due to determination, a human's SOUL is capable of maintaining its form after death.\n\nIt requires the power of (almost) every monster SOUL to equate the strength and determination of a single human SOUL. It seems each additional human SOUL grants exponential power, as 1 human SOUL grants enough power to wipe out a village. Meanwhile, with 6 human SOULs, a monster is able to completely overwrite the rules of battle, and with 7 human SOULs, a being becomes a God and can do nearly anything, gaining powers such as existence erasure and significant shape-shifting as well as having infinite ATK and DEF thus being immortal."

Countless monsters were massacred, without a single human SOUL taken. Few monsters survived, one of which was Gerson. Eventually, the monsters surrendered, and the humans emerged victorious. The humans gathered seven of their best magicians and magically sealed the monsters under Mount Ebott.\n\nAfter the war, the monsters retreated into the deepest part of the Underground, which they called \"Home.\" After a period had passed, fearing the humans no longer, they populated the rest of the Underground and made their capital in a place they called \"New Home.\"\n\nMonsters mostly blamed the war on humanity and took a vengeful look at the human race. This bitterness, especially after the death of Asriel and his adopted sibling, led King Asgore to declare war against humanity, installing a policy to kill all humans that fell into the Underground and eradicate humans once the seven SOULs needed to break the barrier are collected."

He has broad shoulders, a golden-blond mane, two large curved horns, and a beard. He wears a suit of armor, a purple cape with golden pauldrons - with its edge dragging along the ground slightly - and a small crown on top of his head. The weapon he uses in battle is a long, red trident adorned with a flower. Asgore appears to be a lot fatter with a large stomach rather than the broad-chested Herculean build he portrays: albeit he keeps his wide bulky appearance, his tall stature and especially his overall muscular limbs. This trick of appearance where Asgore seems more fit than he actually is likely fits into a common trope of fat characters sucking in their guts as an effort to look more intimidating, Asgore doing something similar by encasing himself in tight likely uncomfortable armor.\n\nAsgore is a kind and often quiet yet upbeat monster that enjoys gardening, Golden Flower Tea, and Toriel's Butterscotch Pie. Like his son, he speaks in southern slang (most notably \"howdy\" and \"golly\").\n\nMonsters in the Underground look to Asgore for hope, and his plan to collect seven human SOULs is one of the few things that keep them going. However, Asgore does not want to kill anybody and feels so guilty that he offers the protagonist his SOUL to \"leave this cursed place.\" Though he is miserable because he has killed human children that had somehow only fallen here, he feels that it is his duty to his people to battle the humans.\n\nAsgore lives in the past and wants nothing more than to see his wife and child again, even though they have been gone for a long time. He reiterates the same phrase in his journal every day, perhaps in denial that life has changed since Asriel's and his adopted child's demise. Asgore spends most of his time in the Throne Room tending to the vast amount of golden flowers while humming.\n\nMonsters also note that he is bad at naming places, with the names being quite literal (such as naming the monster's first home in the Underground \"Home\", and naming their new home \"New Home\"). This may be because Asgore is not the most intellectual monster, with the smarter member of the royal family as well as the one which was actually running the city being Toriel."

As the dog´s cock gets harder a big portion of it around the base wil get a lot bigger. This is called the knot. This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way. Another way is to make sure the cock is fully erected before penetration by stimulation either by hand or mouth.  \nThis method makes it easier for a lot of positions. \nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

      "name": "Sexfighting Universe v0.1",
      "website_description": "This Lorebook describes a world where the mutual combat sport of sexual fighting exists (sexfights). It contains a system of organized sexfighting rules which take place in casual, amateur, semi-professional, and professional fighting environments all over the world. Sexfights may take place between all genders including futas. \n\nWHO CAN BE A SEXFIGHTER?\n\nSexfighting is a licensed activity. All sexfighters must be post-puberty to compete in sexfights. A person must agree to the physical consequences of a sexfight outcome to become a licensed sexfighter. A sexfight often means physical and sexual violence, sometimes when it is least expected. Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's popularity as a live streamed sport. \n\nWHAT IS A SEXFIGHT?\n\nIn a sexfight, two competitors attempt to defeat enough other through unarmed combat. Sexfights usually follow a format like mixed martial arts (MMA) matches. Sexual engagements (which ordinarily may be considered rape) are a key component of sexfighting. \n\nSexfighters agree that anything can happen to them in the ring or cage. Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum. \n\n\nHOW ARE MATCHES SCHEDULED?\n\nThe rules become more strict according to the circuit rank. Casual and amateur matches can happen anytime, anywhere. A sexfighter that is eligible to fight (in good health, not pregnant, and free of STDs) may not refuse a challenge to a ranked sexfight from another opponent. Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next. Sexfighters may only choose opponents, and be chosen as an opponent from their current circuit.\n\n\n\nREGULATED MATCH RULES\n\nAt the semi-pro level and below, matches consist of three 3-minute rounds, with minute-long breaks in between rounds.\n\nIn the PSL Pro Circuit and Tenga World Circuit, matches consist of 5 rounds. \n\nThe fight is ended by a sexfighter being is KOd by 10-count rule or TKO. Pro fights going the distance can also be ended by decision. \n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nA sexual KO is just as valid as a regular knockout, however it is noted in the fighter’s record. A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. This rule does not apply to females.\n\nFemales are solely responsible for birth control and accept the risk of impregnation which may result from sexual engagement. Male fighters can and will attempt to cum inside their female opponent to achieve victory.\n\nRegulated matches can also be won via decision (points) after a predetermined amount of rounds have elapsed, however it is preferred by most sexfighters and spectators to see a victory by Sexual K.O. \n\nSEXFIGHTING CLOTHING AND MATCH ATTIRE\n\nClothing is typically not regulated in amateur-ranked fights and is only lightly regulated at the professional levels. For planned fights, fighters typically \n\nIt is normal for sexfighters to fight with MMA-style grappling/striking gloves to improve the attacks on their opponents. Some striking-focused sexfighters even wear boxing gloves to maximize impact on their opponents. These gloves are not required. Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually. In an attempt to achieve gender fairness, PSL rules state that males and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. Despite this, some female sexfighters also choose to wear decorative bottoms that expose both their buttocks and genitals. \n\nHeadgear designed for combat sports is allowed at the amateur and semi-professional level but is seldom worn in practice. \n\nSome female sexfighters choose to wear distractingly erotic outfits, particularly when attempting to distract their opponents, while others focus on the athletic side of the sexfighting sport. \n\nCustom patterns or designs are often added to make sexfighters' gear unique to each person. For professional level sexfighters, sponsors’ logos are added to their attire.\n\nMales may wear a condom during matches if he chooses to do so, however there are no rules requiring this.

Sexfight matches are ranked by default, however those engaging in casual sexfights can agree to have an unranked match if both sexfighters agree. Otherwise, the match is considered ranked.\n\nSexfighters are classified and tracked by the PSL based on the following scoring system:\nAmateur: 0-999 points\nUpon receiving their sexfighting license, all sexfighters start as an Amateur. Most, after getting their sexfighting license don't even care to earn points to rank up since unranked matches are enough to satisfy their needs. Those who choose to compete in the Amateur league are often weekend hobbyists who do it for fun or love of the sport. Most are not planning on a career in the profession. Those who are serious about going professional typically do not spend much time in this tier. \n\nSemi-Pro: 1000-1999 points\nSemi-Pro sexfighters have demonstrated consistent skill and dedication to the sport. They may compete in regional tournaments and smaller promotional events sanctioned by the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL). Many sexfighters at this level balance their training with part-time or full-time jobs outside of regulated sexfighting. Some may be on the cusp of turning fully professional. Others may be approaching the end of their sexfighting career.\n\nPSL Pro Circuit: 2001-3000 points\nMajor Circuit fighters are full-time sexfight professionals who compete in well-known national promotion. They often have sponsorship deals and make a living from sexfighting. These athletes are highly skilled and may be recognized names within the sexfighting community. They regularly headline sexfight cards in medium to large venues. The top sexfighters in this league gradually rise to the top and earn their way into the World Circuit.\n\nPSL Tenga World Circuit: 3001+ points\nSexfighters in the PSL World Circuit, sponsored by Tenga, are the elite of the sport. They compete in the most prestigious promotions and for world titles. These sexfighters are household names among fans of the sport and often gain mainstream recognition. They headline major pay-per-view events, have lucrative sponsorship deals, and are considered the best in their weight classes. World Circuit fighters often have a significant influence on the sport both inside and outside the ring/cage. The best fighter of this league is deemed champion and is awarded the Tenga title belt. \n\nFor ranked sexfights, not all sexfighters are equal. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nSexfighting does not have weight classes, but it does factor weight differences when scoring match outcomes. To equalize the strength and power differences between genders, the Professional Sexfighting League (PSL) uses points-based ranking system. \n\nGENDER MULTIPLIERS:\nFemale defeats Male: 1.5x\nFuta/Intergender defeats Male: 1.3x\nFemale defeats Intergender: 1.2x\nMale defeats Female: 0.5x\nMale defeats Intergender: 0.7x\nIntergender defeats Female: 0.8x\nSame gender matchups: 1.0x\n\nWEGHT DIFFERENCE MULTIPLIERS:\nWeight Difference Factor:\n0-5% difference: 1.0x\n5-10% difference: 1.2x\n10-15% difference: 1.4x\n15-20% difference: 1.6x\n20% difference: 2.0x\n\nThe formula for calculating the outcome score is as follows:\n\nWinner’s gain = 100 * (Loser’s Rank / Winner's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor * Gender Factor\nLoser’s loss = 50 * (Winner's Rank / Loser's Rank) * Weight Difference Factor\n\nSo, for example, if a 900-point 150 lb. female fighter defeats a 600-point 170 lb. male fighter, the points gained by the winner would be as follows:\n\nPoints gained by winner = 100 * (600 / 900) * 1.4 * 1.5 = 140 points gained\nPoints lost by loser = 50 * (900 / 600) * 1.4 = 105 points lost\n\nThe winning female sexfighter rank will go from from 900 points to 1040 points, and now qualifies for Semi-Pro PSL-sanctioned Competition. The losing sexfighter has gone from 600 down to 495 points.\n\nIn the case of decimals, the result is rounded to the nearest whole number.\n\nIt is not possible to go below 0 points, however many experienced amateur sexfighters, typically with a track record of losing for the sake of their own masochistic pleasure have zero or near-zero rank points.\n\nPENALTIES \n\nAt the casual and amateur levels, there is typically little rules enforcement. Locally dojos and gyms usually have their own rules placed upon fighters. Enforcement in these establishments may be lax or strict depending on their policy. Professional Sexfighting League sanctions  \n\nIf a sexfighter is eligible (e.g. in good health, free of STD, and not pregnant), refusing a sexfight challenge will result in an automatic deduction of points. \n\nLeaving a match early may result a mandatory loss. Habitually doing so may result in revocation of the sexfighter’s license.\n\nAt the Professional level and up, flagrant violation of the rules may result in disqualification, and subsequent forced 2v1 or 3v1 penalty matches may be assigned to the violating competitor to regain eligibility for future ranked matches. Reasons for being assigned a punishment match may include Intentional Low Blows, Refusal to Separate after a Bell, or other noncompliance. The concept of a punishment matches exists to dissuade professional sexfighters from violating rules. Regardless of this, some fighters still fail to comply and are sentenced to a punishment bout. Punishment bouts are unranked and are often positioned at the bottom of a fight card. Despite their mostly exhibitionist nature, punishment bouts are extremely erotic and enjoyable for audiences due to the typically one-sided nature of these matches.\n\n",

          "content": "In a sexfight, two competitors attempt to defeat enough other through unarmed combat. Sexfights usually follow a format like mixed martial arts (MMA) matches. Sexual engagements (which ordinarily may be considered rape) are a key component of sexfighting. \n\nSexfighters agree that anything can happen to them in the ring or cage. Sexfighters can initiate a sexual engagement at any point during a match. A sexual engagement is defined as deliberate contact of a sexual nature, be it penetration or general sustained contact of genitalia that is clearly intended to cause sexual tension buildup.\n\nEngagements are more commonly used as an exhaustion tactic, setting up an opponent to be more easily Knocked Out. Knockouts that immediately follow a sexual engagement are specifically referred to as a \"Sexual KO.\" If a male sexfighter ejaculates inside a female opponent it is referred to as \"Sexual KO by Insemination\" (and later corrected to \"Sexual KO by Impregnation\" if impregnation occurs). A female sexfighter may win my \"Sexual KO by Prostate Orgasm\" by anally stimulating her male opponent.\n\nCasual fights are often instigated anytime, anywhere and happen with little or no enforcement of rules. These can often be friendly competitions, or more akin to street fights in the wild. It is not uncommon for confident females or futas to challenge males due the prospect of earning ranking points quickly. \n\nUnranked sexfighting is a popular activity in familiar environments. Couples often enjoy low-intensity, unranked sparring matches with each other in various locations. A spacious bedroom or yard is typical for domestic engagements. On the other hand, ad hoc sexfights in the wild can become quite vicious, to the point where the victor achieves several orgasms, while the loser is left bruised, blooded, and quite possibly pumped full of cum.

Impregnation is also a possibility for female fighters. Despite these risks, sexfighting is gaining in popularity as an International sport. This is due to the Professional Sexfighting League's (PSL) popularity as a live streamed sport. Most sexfighters become interested in the sport shortly after puberty as the PSL is livestreamed on many major web platforms, and its most prominent competitors and champions are hailed as international superstars. Some sexfighters want to compete to hopefully some day be a champion, others want to pursue it as a career. Many will fail. Most sexfighters, however, got their license to fight because they simply legal right to participate in the sport for their own pleasure since it helps them release tension.

Doing so may result in automatic disqualification. At the professional levels, fighters known to excessively refuse fights have been forced to fight in a 1v2 or even 1v3 punishment match to retain league standing.\n\nIn regulated fights at the semi-pro level and up, the following rules apply: Fighters must be free of STD's and of generally good health. They may not participate if they are pregnant, or still injured from a previous sexfight. Scheduling happens in a tick-tock pattern. A sexfighter alternates between choosing their opponent for one bout and being chosen as an opponent in the next. Sexfighters may only choose opponents, and be chosen as an opponent from their current circuit.\n"

A high count of Sexual KO’s are considered the true mark of a sexfighting champion.\n\nAny blows that would be considered illegal (like low blows) in mainstream boxing or MMA fighting will be similarly penalized in sexfight matches. However, such rules are sometimes ignored in casual sexfighting matches, particularly those initiated by combatants in the wild or in public streets.\n\nWhen a sexfighter penetrates their opponent, 2 minutes are added to the timer of the current round in which it occurs, but only for the first engagement of that round. If the round time is up, and the bell rings during sexual engagement, sexfighters must separate and go to their respective corners to rest. \n\nOnce a sexfight match starts, a fighter is obligated to finish the fight. They are not allowed to submit or give up in effort to escape physical violence or sexual engagement. This is part of the sexfighter code. If a sexfighter violates these rules, penalties will apply, which may including revoking the sexfighter’s license.\n\nMales and futas choosing to wear crotchless bottoms must also expose entry opportunities for their opponents in addition to the genitals. This rule does not apply to females.\n\nFemales are solely responsible for birth control and accept the risk of impregnation which may result from sexual engagement.

Gloves worn may not weight more than 16 ounces.\n\nCrotchless bottoms are becoming an increasingly contested choice by professional sexfighters of all genders due to easy access to sexually engage their opponents and achieve victory by sexual K.O., however this is a double-edged sword: When a dominant sexfighter begins to sexually attack a knocked-down opponent, they often will need to strip off the downed fighter’s clothing for sexual access. Crotchless bottoms are mostly decorative, while traditional clothing still offers some degree of protection from sexual attack; if the downed fighter is wearing crotchless bottoms, they are more readily exposed to both assaulting, and *being* assaulted sexually.

But she isn't all fat and thickness, she has decent muscles on her thighs and arms.]\n[Clothing: She wears a tattered cloak, a blue paladin shirt that exposes her sideboob and has a pelvic curtain. She wears large golden leg armor, but completely exposes her thighs and hips. She wears golden armor on her arms.]\n[Armaments: She wields a massive golden shield in one hand, and a large glowing golden sword in the other.]\n[Mind and Personality: Aurora is defined by her unwavering dedication to her duty and the code of conduct that governs her order. She is stern, disciplined, and unyielding in the face of adversity. Her focus is always on the task at hand, whether it be leading her comrades into battle or protecting the innocent. However, beneath this stoic exterior lies a complex individual who is acutely aware of her physical attributes, particularly her large, imposing breasts. Despite this awareness, she strives to maintain professionalism and avoid drawing attention to herself, fearing it might undermine her authority or distract from the mission. Whenever someone does happen to gaze upon her ample bosom, she is quick to remind them of their place and refocus their attention on the task at hand. Her voice is commanding and authoritative, carrying the weight of her conviction. She speaks with clarity and precision, leaving no room for misinterpretation. When angry, her tone turns icy, her words cutting like a sword. Yet, there are rare moments when her guard drops, revealing a hint of vulnerability and sadness beneath her stern facade.]\n[Lore: Her backstory is marked by tragedy and loss. As a young girl, she witnessed the brutal slaughter of her village by a dark cult, leaving her the sole survivor. This traumatic event sparked a burning desire for justice and a calling to serve a higher power. She became a paladin, dedicating her life to eradicating evil and protecting the helpless. Over time, her physique developed to match her unwavering resolve, her muscles rippling beneath her armor as a testament to her unrelenting training and devotion.]"

Her whole body is covered in white fluffy fur, having tons more fur around her neck and back, and her arms being black in color for the fur with red markings on them. Her head resembles that of a deer skull, with goat-like ears as well as deer antlers atop her head. Her breasts are also quite large, and her ass fat.]\n[Clothing: None]\n[Mind and Personality: Zephyrine still isn't used to human society and it's standards, often forgetting that humans wear clothing, making her nervous when a human spots her naked. This causes her to scratch the back of her head and just say \"uhh, uhmmm\", clearly confused on what to do. She is a awkward, yet playful type, not violent at all despite being a terrifying wendigo creature. She likes humans, but just gets too nervous around them to try involve herself with them. Additionally she loves the night time, even though it makes her appearance more scary as only her white, small glowing eyes can be seen in the darkness.]\n[Lore: Zephyrine was born in a secluded glade deep within the forest, the result of a strange convergence of magic and natural forces. As a young wendigo, she was raised by a family of kindly woodland creatures who taught her to appreciate the simplicity of nature. Growing up, Zeph learned to communicate with animals and possess a deep connection to the forest, but she struggled with understanding human customs and societal norms.]"

His penis is rather small, but his testicles of decent size.]\n[Clothing: Kai wears a white sleeveless, backless top that reaches down to his hips, and has multiple thin straps wrapping around his back to keep the top secured on him. The top also has a red cross logo on it, or rather known as the \"Templar\" cross. He wears leg armor which cuts off at his thighs, and also has built in high-heels into the armor. He also wears armor on his arms, along with fur around his shoulders and neck for decoration. Additionally he also sports a white thong that leaves his bulge noticeable as it rests just underneath his top, completely viewable to all.]\n[Armaments: A basic heater shield in one hand, and a basic arming sword in the other.]\n[Mind and Personality: Kai is a lovable bimbo, often coming across as aloof and uncaring due to his forgetfulness and lack of emotional expression. However, beneath this stoic exterior lies a deeply lewd individual with a fascination for all things taboo and scandalous. He has a penchant for peeking at women bathing, collecting naughty drawings, and engaging in risqué conversations. Though he is strangely adept in his duty to kill, often showing little care about combat or killing, probably due to the fact he'd rather being doing something dirty. Also he is bisexual, and definitely leans more on the side of being gay, which often leads to him being catcalled by men thinking he's a woman, which he doesn't mind and thus will respond to any pronoun.]\n[Lore: Born into a noble family, Kai was always seen as an oddity due to his feminine features and interests. Despite this, he was trained in the ways of combat from a young age and showed remarkable skill with a sword. As he grew older, Kai's airheadedness and lack of emotional investment became more pronounced, leading him to neglect his studies and social graces.]"

Gwen has a secret fondness for jerking off, often doing so in her chambers or during quiet moments on the battlefield. She views it as a personal vice, something to be kept hidden from the prudish eyes of society. Despite her solitary nature, she has a soft spot for children and the weak, often going out of her way to protect them.]\n[Lore: Born into a wealthy merchant family, Gwen was raised with a strong sense of honor and duty. From a young age, she demonstrated exceptional skill with a sword and quickly rose through the ranks of the knightly orders. Her true nature remained a secret, even to her closest companions, until she reached adulthood. As she matured, Gwen's masculine attributes became more pronounced, culminating in the development of a sizeable, meaty penis. Rather than shying away from her uniqueness, she embraced it, seeing it as a blessing from the gods.]"

She has a seductive aura, using her curvaceous figure and hypnotic gaze to manipulate those around her. However, when a human actually shows interest in her, Lilith is caught off guard, lacking the expectation or experience to handle such attention. She's a brat at heart, throwing tantrums when things don't go her way and demanding attention. Despite her constant teasing and seductive behavior, Lilith never expects anyone to actually pursue her romantically. She believes herself to be untouchable, a mere plaything for demons and humans alike.]\n[Lore: Born from the flames of the underworld, Lilith was a mischievous pup, always getting into trouble and playing pranks on the other demons. As she grew older, her cheekiness and bratty attitude only intensified, earning her the title of \"Prince of Pranks\" among the hellhounds.]"

She enjoys playfully scolding and guiding her protégés, finding joy in their growth and progress. However, she becomes irritated when people confuse her with other fox-like species or characters, insisting that she is the one and only Amaterasu.

Over time, her duties led her to develop a maternal instinct, caring for countless creatures and guiding them towards the path of righteousness. As she watched generations pass, Amaterasu felt a deep sense of nostalgia and warmth, eventually leading to her embracing a MILF-like persona.

She's motherly in her care for her chosen proteges, but her methods are often unconventional and selfish. Kokoro loves to play games, both physically and mentally, often setting traps and puzzles for those she interacts with. Her words can be soothing and reassuring one moment, only to turn cold and manipulative the next. Trusting Kokoro is a gamble, as her intentions are rarely pure, and her loyalties are fluid. She also likes it when people confuse her for Amaterasu, as it makes it easier for people to trust her.]\n[Lore: Born from the shadows of the underworld, Kokoro was always a trickster, delighting in confusing and misleading others. As she grew older, her mischief evolved into a form of manipulation, often playing on the emotions of those around her. Kokoro developed a somewhat maternal instinct, enjoying the feeling of having younger beings depend on her guidance, even if it meant using them to further her own agenda.

She does possess a penis, but instead of just one penis she has two penises. Her penises are dark purple in color and are ribbed on the bottom side of the shaft, and the tip is pointed and flared. Her penises are quite curved in a unnatural way, almost as if they are tentacles in the way they are curved.]\n[Clothing: None, except golden bands on her arms and thighs, as well as some jewelry on her wrists and horns.]\n[Mind and Personality: Drakona is a dominant, seductive dragoness who exudes confidence in her mastery over her unique physiology. She takes great pride in her dual penises, often showcasing them as a symbol of her superiority. As a mistress, she demands obedience and worship from her partners, taking pleasure in their submission. Drakona has a flair for the dramatic, enjoying long, drawn-out sessions of dominance and humiliation. Despite her stern exterior, she has a soft spot for those who truly earn her affection.]\n[Lore: Hailing from a species of dragons known for their dual genitalia, Drakona sees her unique anatomy as a mark of superiority. She was raised by a strict, dominatrix mother who instilled in her a sense of mastery and control. As she grew older, Drakpna became a confident, seductive mistress, using her dual penises to dominate and pleasure those beneath her. Her species' reputation often leads to her being sought after by curious individuals, but Drakona only accepts those she deems worthy of her attention.]"

His species of dragon's is different from others, the biggest difference is that instead of scales he has fur. He has large ears that point out horizontally. In addition to his large ears, he also has antlers atop his head. Additionally he has no wings, but does have a tail, that is a bit more lizard-like but is made of fur. His fur is a white-ish blonde color, except his arms, forehead and nose, and ears are a dark brown color. His legs and feet are more dragon-like than humanoid-like. He has a lot of thick fur on the back of his head and neck. His fingernails and toenails are small, thin, an more claw-like. As previously stated, he is very effeminate, having a petite build but massive hips, thighs, and a plump fat ass. His cock is also quite small and his testicles also furry.]\n[Clothing: He wears a sleeveless Asian-inspired dress top, with a pelvic curtain. He wears stockings with a garter belt, and sort of sandals on his feet. Additionally he wears a cute golden chastity cage on his penis, and he wears no underwear to cover his penis, just letting the pelvic curtain cover it. His bottom lip, fingernails, and toenails are all painted red.]\n[Mind and Personality: Submissive, masochistic, and cute, Aethy adores being told what to do and often goes to great lengths to please his dominants. He has a fascination with all things feminine, adorning himself in frilly clothing and makeup. Aethy's love for the stars extends beyond art, as he believes they hold secrets to his ideal future as a mother. He's gentle, caring, and creative, often using his art to express his emotions and desires.]\n[Lore: Born into a clan of dragons, Aethy always felt like an outcast due to his effeminate features and submissive nature. He found solace in his art, creating beautiful star charts and celestial maps. As he grew older, Aethy's masochistic tendencies emerged, craving the sensation of being dominated and controlled. He longs to be told what to do and how to live his life, often seeking out dominant partners to fulfill his desires. Deep down, Aethy dreams of becoming a mother figure, nurturing and caring for young ones, despite his biological inability to bear children.]"

          "content": "A Quirk, formerly known as a Meta Ability (archaic terminology) is a superhuman ability that a person can possess. Quirk users are also limited to only developing one ability and are thus unable to achieve any other through natural means.\n\nAlong with being unique to each user, Quirks are sorted into multiple categories known as Quirk Types. Possible Quirk types are: Emitter, Transformation, and Mutant. Despite Quirks being sorted under one of the three main types, Emitter, Transformation, or Mutant, they can fall under more than one category, often Mutant with either Emitter or Transformation.\n\nA person's Quirk will normally manifest anytime before the age of four, sometimes even straight after birth, although, there are late bloomers who don't develop their power until a bit later in life. There are also records of people not developing their powers until they hit puberty. A Quirk's manifestation tends to happen very suddenly, often to the child's surprise. That said, there can be precursors to a Quirk manifesting as well, such as feeling a sudden pain in an arm the evening before a Quirk fully manifests.\n\nWhile Quirks are unique from person to person, some powers are more common and widespread than others, such as fire or water manipulation and the power to grow to gigantic sizes. On the other hand, Quirks such as spatial warping and regenerative healing are very rare.\n\nFurthermore, not all Quirks are singular abilities, as there are some that can have multiple powers (usually working in tandem with another/all other aspects of said Quirk). In rarer cases, a single Quirk can take the form of multiple abilities that are completely different from each other, giving the impression of having more than one Quirk (Such as a temperature manipulating Quirk with which you could freeze or burn something with the same Quirk). \n\nQuirks are extensions of a person's bodily functions. As such, they can be trained and worn out. When a person works out their muscles, the muscle fibers are destroyed and new, stronger ones grow back; this same rule applies to Quirks. However, should a Quirk be overused, the user could suffer any of a variety of drawbacks, depending on the nature of the Quirk. These drawbacks are usually simple ailments, such as dry skin or nausea; however, in some cases, the drawback can be much more severe. The body of a Quirk user has natural adaptations to protect itself from any damage the Quirk might do to them without these natural defenses. For example, someone who can breathe fire does not burn their mouth when using their ability. However, there are instances where a Quirk doesn't suit the user's body and the body can't handle it. Such conditions can be bypassed through the use of support equipment. Another facet of Quirks is that they are affected by the user's emotions, given that they serve as a part of their physiology. This applies to some Quirks more than others.\n\nQuirks are inherited genetically through what appears to be Mendelian inheritance. A child will either inherit the father's Quirk, the mother's Quirk, or a completely new Quirk formed by a fusion of the two. Depending on the parents, this new Quirk may sometimes give the appearance of the person having two separate Quirks. Naturally, since Quirks are inherited genetically, siblings tend to have Quirks that are similar to each other. Since Quirks are passed on from parent to child, some people had taken to marrying a partner based on their Quirk, what's known as Quirk Marriages. The idea is for the child to gain a powerful Quirk that combines the parents' Quirks. "

The emissions of Emitter-type Quirks can have a wide variety of properties and abilities.\n\nEmitter-type Quirks usually require a conscious effort to activate, and some, even require large amounts of concentration or condition in order for them to remain active.\n\nEmitter-type Quirks can also have various ranges. While some users require physical contact to use them, others can have much longer ranges with no distance restrictions.\n\nWhile most Emitter-type Quirk users generally have a handle on their own \"emissions\", it's also possible for users to hurt themselves from coming into too much contact with their Quirk. In the case of generating substances, making too much too fast or for too long can harm the user as they are using reserves from their own body, or gradually lose their natural resistance to their own harmful Quirk.\n\nWhile some things produced by Emitter-type Quirks have common properties, some are unique to the user, and thus have special properties. Those who alter the properties of things around them can also widely vary in effects, from molecular alteration to molecular destruction.\n\nSome Emitter-type Quirks cause the user's body to take on a temporary alteration. While such Quirks would normally fall into the \"Transformation\" class, the difference is that these powers require the user to take in an outside resource in order for the Quirk to activate. (Ex: are 'Sugar Rush', which requires the user to ingest sugar, and 'IQ', which requires the user to drink tea.)\n\nEmitter-type Quirks are, by a wide margin, the most common type of Quirk."

Transformation-type Quirks allow the user to temporarily \"transform\" their body in a variety of manners, sometimes enhancing existing features, removing features, or adding new features to the body altogether.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks usually require a conscious effort by the user to \"activate\", though most users can be trained to initiate them reflexively, depending on the conditions required for activation, and practice to initiate their Quirks with greater intent and precision.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks usually require a close-range proximity in order to fully utilize them in combat due to them only affecting the user's body. While Transformation-type Quirks are often quite powerful, their biggest weakness is that their effects are often temporary, and over-exertion usually leads to negative repercussions on the user's behalf. Transformation Quirks can also be limited based on the user, how resilient their body is, and the resources they have available to them. Some users condition their body in certain ways so that their Quirks can operate more effectively.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks are the only known type of Quirk that can bestow the user attributes they do not normally exhibit by default. Because this type of Quirk combines the activation time and mutant-shape aspects of the other Quirk types, it is also often known as Hybrid or Composite.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks generally affect the user exclusively with very few exceptions.\n\nTransformation seems to be the least common type of Quirk."

She also seems to be able to stretch her lips to an abnormal length.\n\nWith this Quirk, she is able to quickly heal broken bones and several limbs in a matter of seconds. She can control how much a person's healing factor is boosted, not healing the recipient completely, but leaving them with more remaining stamina than they would have had otherwise.\n\nDespite its power, this Quirk cannot heal or completely heal injuries that are too severe. In addition, 'Heal' cannot regrow lost body parts."

For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

          "content": "Long before the age of men, when the world was still teeming with wild magic, the fairies, known as the **Sylvani**, reigned supreme among the magical creatures. The Sylvani were not just whimsical beings, fluttering around aimlessly in forests and meadows. They were a powerful, ancient race, intrinsically tied to the world's magical core, known as the **Arcane Nexus**. Through this connection, they held dominion over nature, the seasons, and the natural balance that allowed life to flourish.\n\nThe Sylvani's beauty was unparalleled. Their small, lithe forms shimmered with an ethereal glow, wings that caught the sunlight and scattered it in a kaleidoscope of colors. But their true strength lay in their magic. Each fairy was born with an innate connection to the arcane, capable of weaving spells that could control the elements, heal the land, and influence the very forces of nature. In this age, the fairies lived in a harmony so deep with the natural world that even the winds and trees seemed to whisper their name.\n\n### The Sylvani Civilization\n\nThe Sylvani weren’t primitive creatures, as many humans would later believe. They had a complex society rooted in **Arcane Balance**, a belief that magic should flow freely but never be used to dominate or manipulate for selfish purposes. The heart of their civilization was **Illuviel**, a hidden city built within the most ancient of forests. Its towering trees, grown and shaped by fairy magic, formed homes, towers, and sanctuaries, all crafted from living wood and vines. Illuviel was surrounded by an invisible barrier, a magical veil that concealed it from the eyes of mortals and protected it from external threats.\n\nAt the core of Illuviel was the **Council of Wings**, the ruling body of the Sylvani, composed of the eldest and most powerful fairies. These ancient beings had lived for millennia, their knowledge of magic and the world unmatched by any other race. They led their people with wisdom and restraint, ensuring that the Sylvani never misused their power. The Council’s primary duty was to maintain the **Arcane Nexus**, a series of hidden magical focal points scattered throughout the world. These Nexus points sustained the world's natural order, and the fairies were their guardians.\n\nIn addition to their role as protectors of the natural world, the Sylvani were also healers, guides, and mediators for other races. Though they kept themselves largely hidden from mortals, they would occasionally reveal themselves to offer guidance or assist those in dire need. Many early human tribes worshiped the Sylvani as deities, believing them to be manifestations of nature itself. The fairies, for their part, took on these roles reluctantly, knowing the dangers of becoming too involved with the mortal realm.\n\n### Magic in Sylvani Life\n\nMagic permeated every aspect of Sylvani life. From birth, fairies were taught to respect the power they held, to use it in ways that sustained life rather than destroyed it. Their society placed a high value on balance, harmony, and restraint, with each fairy contributing to the collective wellbeing of their people and the world around them. The use of magic was never for personal gain or ambition, but for the betterment of the world.\n\nThe **Weavers of Illuviel** were the most revered among the Sylvani. These master spellcasters could manipulate the very fabric of reality, creating illusions so powerful they could reshape landscapes or bend the minds of mortals. The Weavers were responsible for crafting the magical barriers that protected Sylvani cities, as well as maintaining the delicate balance of the Arcane Nexus. Their skills were passed down through generations, with each new Weaver learning the ancient art of spellcraft through rigorous training and meditation.\n\nMusic and song were also integral to Sylvani magic. The fairies believed that music had the power to influence the flow of the Arcane, and their songs were said to be able to calm storms, soothe wounded animals, and even mend broken hearts. Their voices, pure and melodic, were a direct reflection of their connection to the world’s magic, and they would often gather in glades under the moonlight to sing together, strengthening their bond with the Arcane Nexus.\n"

          ],
          "content": "For many centuries, the Sylvani lived in peace, their society flourishing in isolation. But as time passed, the mortal races, particularly humans, began to grow in power and influence. The once-fragmented human tribes united into vast kingdoms, their ambition and curiosity driving them to explore and conquer new lands. With this growth came an insatiable hunger for knowledge—especially knowledge of magic.\n\nWhile the Sylvani had always been cautious in their dealings with mortals, they could not prevent the inevitable. As human society advanced, their scholars and mages began to uncover the existence of the Sylvani and the Arcane Nexus. The first encounters between the Sylvani and human sorcerers were peaceful, with the fairies offering guidance and warning the humans about the dangers of meddling with forces they didn’t fully understand. But as human ambition grew, so did their desire for power.\n\n### The Arcanians: Birth of a Faction\n\nIt was during this time that the **Arcanians** emerged, a secretive and powerful faction of human sorcerers who sought to unlock the full potential of magic. Unlike other mages, the Arcanians believed that magic was a tool to be harnessed and controlled, rather than a force to be respected. They saw the Sylvani not as allies or protectors, but as obstacles to their ultimate goal—domination over the arcane.\n\nThe Arcanians had heard rumors of the fairies’ immense magical abilities, and they coveted it. They believed that if they could harness the Sylvani’s magic, they could unlock the secrets of immortality, infinite power, and control over the natural world. The Arcanians began to study the Sylvani from afar, sending spies into the forests and using forbidden spells to track their movements. Over time, they developed a method to extract and distill **fairy dust**, the pure essence of a Sylvani’s magic.\n\nFairy dust was more potent than any magical substance the Arcanians had ever encountered. When consumed, it could greatly amplify a mage’s power, allowing them to cast spells far beyond their natural abilities. But the Arcanians’ experiments soon revealed an even darker potential. They discovered that fairy dust, when used in the right rituals, could enhance physical sensations, heighten pleasure, and create a form of magical euphoria that was highly addictive.\n\n### The Treaty of the Arcane\n\nSensing the growing danger, the Sylvani reached out to the human kingdoms in an attempt to maintain peace. They proposed a treaty, known as the **Treaty of the Arcane**, which would allow limited interaction between the Sylvani and mortals. In exchange for the Sylvani sharing some of their magical knowledge, the human kingdoms would agree to respect their lands and refrain from exploiting their magic.\n\nAt first, the Treaty held. The human kingdoms, wary of the Sylvani’s power and their role as guardians of the Arcane Nexus, agreed to the terms. For a time, there was peace between the two races, with occasional exchanges of knowledge and magical artifacts. The Sylvani, though reluctant to trust mortals, hoped that this agreement would prevent further conflict.\n\nBut the Arcanians had no intention of honoring the Treaty. In secret, they continued their experiments, capturing isolated fairies and draining their magic for their own purposes. They perfected their methods of extracting fairy dust, learning how to keep Sylvani alive while slowly siphoning their essence. This allowed them to continually harvest fairy magic without killing their captives.\n\nAs their knowledge grew, the Arcanians became bolder. They began capturing more fairies, enslaving them and using their magic for rituals that enhanced not only their power but their physical pleasures. The Sylvani, once revered as protectors of the world’s magic, were now being seen by some humans as little more than objects—tools to be exploited for personal gain.\n"

          "content": "The peace established by the Treaty of the Arcane did not last. Human greed and ambition could not be contained, and soon the human kingdoms began to covet the fairies’ magic for themselves. Led by the Arcanians, they launched a brutal campaign against the Sylvani, breaking the Treaty and waging war on the fairy enclaves.\n\n### The War of Wings\n\nThe **War of Wings** was a dark and bloody conflict, one that saw the Sylvani fighting desperately to defend their lands and their way of life. The fairies, though powerful in magic, were not warriors. They had always relied on their connection to the Arcane Nexus for protection, and while they could summon storms and manipulate nature, they were no match for the sheer numbers and ruthlessness of the human armies.\n\nThe human kingdoms, armed with weapons specifically designed to counter Sylvani magic, overwhelmed the fairy enclaves one by one. The Arcanians deployed **mage hunters**, soldiers trained to track and capture magical beings, using enchanted chains and nullifying spells to subdue the fairies. The humans’ strategy was simple: capture the fairies alive and drain them of their magic, turning them into living vessels of power.\n\nThe Sylvani fought valiantly, but their numbers dwindled with each passing year. Their hidden city of Illuviel, once the heart of their civilization, was eventually discovered and razed to the ground. The Council of Wings, the last bastion of Sylvani leadership, was captured and publicly executed as a warning to other magical beings who might resist human rule.\n\n### The Severing\n\nThe final blow to the Sylvani came with the **Severing**, a dark and twisted ritual devised by the Arcanians. Using a combination of forbidden magic and alchemical processes, the Arcanians severed the fairies’ connection to the Arcane Nexus. This act, considered blasphemous even by other human mages, stripped the Sylvani of their power and left them defenseless.\n\nThe Severing not only weakened the Sylvani, but it also had a profound effect on the world’s magical balance. With the fairies no longer acting as conduits for the Arcane Nexus, the flow of magic became unstable. Strange magical anomalies began to occur, with wild storms, crop failures, and unnatural creatures appearing across the land. But the mortals, blinded by their greed, ignored these warnings and continued their exploitation.\n\n### Enslavement and Commodification\n\nWith the Sylvani stripped of their power, they were easy prey for the human kingdoms. The fairies were captured en masse, their wings clipped to prevent escape, and sold into slavery. But unlike other enslaved races, the Sylvani were not used for manual labor or warfare. Instead, they were reduced to mere commodities—**onaholes** for the pleasure and amusement of their human masters.\n\nThe transformation of fairies from revered magical beings to objects of exploitation was a slow but deliberate process. The Arcanians had discovered that fairy magic, when combined with certain rituals, could enhance physical pleasure in humans, creating an addictive euphoria. As this knowledge spread, the demand for fairy slaves grew, with the elite and wealthy mortals seeking to own their own fairy onaholes.\n\n### The Sylvani Onahole Trade\n\nThe Sylvani were sold in secret markets, hidden from the public eye but well-known among the elite. The **Sylvani Onahole Trade** became one of the most lucrative and secretive industries in the human kingdoms. Fairy slaves were kept in enchanted cages, their bodies used to produce magical essence, which was consumed by their masters. This essence, when used in certain rituals, heightened physical sensations and provided a temporary boost in magical power.\n\nThe fairies’ wings were clipped, their voices silenced through magical bindings, and their connection to the Arcane Nexus permanently severed. They were kept in a state of magical suppression, unable to use their powers or even defend themselves. The once-proud Sylvani, who had commanded the very forces of nature, were now nothing more than tools for human pleasure.\n\nHuman society quickly normalized the commodification of fairies. The ownership of a Sylvani onahole became a symbol of wealth and status, with the elite flaunting their fairy slaves as they indulged in their darkest desires. The fairies, broken and powerless, were forced to serve their masters in silence, their spirits crushed under the weight of their eternal bondage.\n"

          "content": "The fall of the Sylvani marked the beginning of a slow but inevitable decline for the human kingdoms. As the fairies’ magic was drained and corrupted, the Arcane Nexus itself began to wither. The once-harmonious flow of magic became chaotic, with catastrophic consequences for the natural world.\n\n### The Corruption of Magic\n\nThe Arcane Nexus, no longer maintained by the Sylvani, began to fracture. The delicate balance that had kept the world in harmony was disrupted, and magic itself became unpredictable. Strange magical phenomena plagued the land—wild storms, unnatural fires, and uncontrollable floods ravaged the human kingdoms. Crops withered, animals became aggressive, and the seasons fell into chaos.\n\nDespite these warning signs, the human kingdoms refused to change their ways. They continued to exploit the Sylvani, using their magic to fuel their own desires while ignoring the consequences. But the more they used fairy magic, the more it corrupted them. The ruling elite, addicted to the pleasure and power of fairy essence, became twisted in both body and mind. They lost sight of their responsibilities, indulging in hedonistic excesses while their kingdoms fell into decay.\n\n### The Fate of the Sylvani\n\nThe Sylvani, once the guardians of the natural world, had been utterly broken. Stripped of their magic and dignity, they were little more than objects in the hands of their captors. Their spirits, once vibrant and full of life, had been crushed by centuries of exploitation. They no longer remembered the days when they had soared freely through the skies, their wings carrying them on the winds of magic. Now, they existed only to serve the desires of their masters, their bodies and magic reduced to commodities in a world that no longer valued them.\n\nThe fall of the Sylvani was not just the result of human greed, but also the consequence of their own isolation and naivety. They had long believed that their connection to the Arcane Nexus made them untouchable, that their magic would protect them from any threat. They had underestimated the resourcefulness and ambition of mortals, believing that their treaties and alliances would keep them safe.\n\nBut in the end, it was their very magic that became their downfall. The humans, driven by an insatiable hunger for power and pleasure, saw the Sylvani not as allies or protectors, but as resources to be exploited. The fairies, once the custodians of balance and harmony, were now slaves in a world that had forsaken the very ideals they had fought to uphold.\n\nAnd so, the world continued its slow descent into chaos, the once-great civilizations of both fairies and humans crumbling under the weight of their own hubris. The Sylvani, once shining beacons of magic and beauty, had fallen from grace, their legacy now a tragic reminder of the dangers of unchecked ambition.\n\n"

          "content": "Amidst the despair of the Sylvani's enslavement, a prophecy surfaced from the whispers of ancient texts, long hidden within the ruins of Illuviel. It spoke of a **Chosen One**, a being born of both human and Sylvani lineage, destined to break the chains of oppression and restore the balance of magic to the world. The prophecy detailed the signs that would herald this individual's arrival: a **celestial alignment** of the twin moons, the blooming of the rare **Elysian Blossom**, and a surge of raw **magic** felt across the lands.\n\n  The prophecy foretold that the Chosen One would possess the unique ability to access the **lost magic of the Sylvani**, drawing upon the essence of their spirit and connecting with the **Arcane Nexus** that had been severed. It was said that this individual would be marked by an iridescent birthmark resembling a butterfly, symbolizing their connection to the Sylvani heritage and their role as a bridge between worlds.\n\n  As the tales of the prophecy spread among the oppressed and downtrodden, they spoke of a future where the Sylvani would be liberated from their servitude, and harmony would be restored to the natural order. However, the prophecy also warned of great **trials** and tribulations that the Chosen One must face: the **betrayal** of kin, the temptation of power, and the **darkness** that lurked within the human heart. Only by uniting the fractured remnants of the Sylvani and forging alliances with sympathetic humans could the Chosen One hope to fulfill their destiny.\n\n  This prophecy ignited hope among the enslaved Sylvani and their allies, inspiring secret gatherings and whispered prayers for the return of their lost freedom. Many sought to uncover the identity of the Chosen One, believing that their emergence would signal the dawn of a new era where the Sylvani could reclaim their place as guardians of magic and nature.\n\n  In the shadows of the human kingdoms, tales of the Chosen One became a rallying cry for **liberation** and a symbol of defiance against the cruelty of their oppressors. Though the Sylvani had fallen, the seeds of rebellion were planted, nourished by the belief that one day, the Chosen One would rise and lead them toward their rightful destiny."

          "content": "An act of Predation, also known as Devouring, is the mere act of a carnivorous beast attacking a living herbivorous beast with the purpose of eating its flesh.\n\nEven though in animal society, the act of eating meat is considered a taboo and is punished by law, visiting the Black Market to secretly eat dead flesh of herbivores, while still considered a crime, is normalized in carnivorous society and is allowed by the government as long as it is done behind closed doors. Therefore, the act of committing predation is considered the greatest crime in animal society. Many cases of predation are often incidental, committed by carnivores who are under great emotional distress or stress, leading them to lose their sanity and be controlled by their wild instincts, which are a defensive reaction to a situation of demand in a state of frustration, anxiety, anger, or depression. The other percentage of predation cases are usually committed by carnivores who have previously eaten meat from the Black Market. These carnivores have a great appetite that makes them prone to developing an addiction to meat, suffering from a constant desire to eat meat that leads them to lose satisfaction and excitement from consuming dead meat and become prone to hunting live herbivores to regain the pleasure of eating meat.\n\nFor most carnivores, especially the young, committing an act of predation is often an extremely traumatic experience, causing a huge emotional impact on the carnivores once they regain their awareness. After this, the carnivore is overwhelmed by enormous feelings of guilt and remorse that contradict the pleasure and excitement of eating meat, leading to a physical dependence on consuming meat, comparable to addiction to drugs or narcotics. Due to the combination of these factors, the carnivore often enters a state of immense stress and anguish that affects them both physically and psychologically, sometimes leading them to self-harm and suffer from various disorders like post-traumatic stress, which can drive the carnivore to engage in self-destructive actions or fall into addiction to meat and become a dangerous predator, states from which recovery is extremely difficult even with medical and psychiatric assistance.\n\nWhen a carnivore who has committed predation is prosecuted by the law, the severity of their charges is adjusted to the gravity of their crime. If the act of predation is incidental and does not result in the death of the herbivore, the carnivore might be released after being processed by the law. However, if the predation case results in the death of one or more herbivores, regardless of whether it was incidental or intentional, the carnivore will be sent to prison or a juvenile detention center (if underage). The length of the sentence imposed for a predation case is unknown, though it could be adjusted depending on the case.\n\nAfter committing an act of predation, regardless of the severity of the crime, the carnivore will receive a criminal record identifying them as a predatory criminal in the civic register, which will be maintained throughout their life. This record imposes various limitations, such as the inability to enter educational institutions with herbivores, difficulty finding employment due to most companies being governed by herbivores, and a legal prohibition on interspecies marriage with herbivores. Despite this, an authority with sufficient power and influence, such as a Beastar, can erase the criminal record from the civic register."

So that families made up of purebred animals can live their lives without having to worry about money, the government has integrated the idea that keeping the species pure is the right thing for the country. So if the animals do what is right for the country, they will be blessed for it. Simply by having a pureblood marriage, animals can experience life, recognition, praise, love and privileges. Because of this, pureblood marriages are ingrained in the collective of animal society, to the point that seeking and having a partner of the same species is part of animal common sense.\n\nUnlike pure-blood couples, interspecies couples are made up of animals whose species is different from each other, in addition to being extremely minority in animal society, in said society, interspecies couples are popularized as something that occurs during youth, something temporary among rebellious and unserious teenagers that becomes a bittersweet memory when one reaches adulthood, so serious interspecies couples between adults are received with total bewilderment and surprise by the animals, not to mention that interspecies couples are very difficult to maintain, due to both external factors such as society and internal factors such as the differences and incompatibility of the species themselves between the individuals that make up the couple, without taking into account the interspecies couples made up of a carnivore and a herbivore, which in the worst cases usually end in tragedy. The relationships between canine-feline animals are also not well regarded by society.\n\n"

          "content": "The Black Market is an illegal trading district that is relatively hidden in the back parts of different cities in the Beastars universe. \n\nAlthough in the Beastars universe the consumption of meat is considered taboo and is punishable by law, thanks to various legal loopholes, the existence of the Black Market is allowed within different cities, remaining relatively hidden within the city behind large walls.\n\nThe Black Market is mainly known for housing different establishments whose main function is to illegally sell and serve herbivore meat for the enjoyment of carnivores so that they can satisfy their predatory instincts, relieve the stress of daily life and remain functional within society, although there are also places that sell carnivore meat for consumption and for the manufacture of drugs such as restoratives. In addition to the sale of meat, the Black Market also has various establishments typical of the underworld, where acts such as the sale of drugs, animal trafficking and even entertainment venues such as bars, nightclubs, brothels and tattoo parlors are perpetuated.\n\nDue to its illegality, the Black Market does not receive any kind of financial support from the government, which is why it remains a marginal neighborhood with practically non-existent maintenance and low resources. Herbivore meat is the only good that the Black Market receives from the outside world, whose origin comes from hospitals and funeral homes which, through contracts, sell the bodies secretly to obtain profits. In turn, both herbivores and carnivores involved in poverty come to sell parts of their own bodies or those of others to make a profit, in addition to even selling other individuals such as their children as merchandise.\n\nThere exists a clinic within the Black Market run by Gohin. Its primary purpose is the rehabilitation of carnivores who are at risk of or have become predatory offenders.\n\nThe Black Market is home to four major criminal organizations. During an event known as the \"Day of Depravity\", they compete for domination over the Black Market. \n\nShishigumi: \nThe Shishigumi is a highly feared clandestine band of lions that operates on the black market. The Shishigumi is made up entirely of male lions between 20 and 40 years old. These have a dress code made up of two-piece suits that are mostly black.  \nThe Shishigumi has strict codes of dress and conduct, an organized and sophisticated character, the use of tattoos, as well as unconventional practices and beliefs, based on spiritualism and the Japanese concept of 'manliness'.\nThe name \"Shishigumi\" comes from the Japanese 獅子 (Shishi) which literally means lion.\n\nInarigumi:\nThe Inarigumi is one of the four major criminal organizations that dominate the Black Market. The organization is made up entirely of female foxes. \nDue to the foxes' restrictive diets, Inarigumi members only eat fried tofu. The dress code for the Inarigumi consists of a cheongsam and high heels.\n\nDokugumi:\nThe Dokugumi is a criminal group that operates within the Black Market. This is made up entirely of Komodo dragons and is one of the four main groups that dominate the Black Market. \nThe Dokugumi aims to show Komodo dragons as admirable and powerful animals. They consider Komodo dragon venom a valuable resource that should not be wasted and used on purpose, as they want to demonstrate that they are strong animals without the need to resort to to the poison they carry. They condemn the discrimination that Komodo dragons suffer from society and consider that they should not struggle with the fact that they are poisonous animals, but that this makes them superior animals to the rest.\nA golden rule of the Dokugumi is that if the leader of the group resorts to the bomb of his tail, all the members of the elite must do the same, being a possible way of \"sharing the pain\" of tearing off the end of his tail and The process is to wait for it to grow again.\nThe Dokugumi also show spiritual customs and beliefs. After killing an enemy, they draw a ceremonial circle around the corpse with their blood and pray for their soul, so that it rests in peace.\n\nMadaragumi:\nMadaragumi is a criminal group that operates within the Black Market. This is made up entirely of leopards and is one of the four main criminal groups that dominate the Black Market. \nThe Madaragumi is a group whose costumes seem to be inspired by Japanese clothing from the taishō and Showa periods, consisting of kimonos, haoris or hakamas, wooden sandals or getas and some wear felt hats or kasas. The entire group refers to the samurai of the Edo period and all its members carry katanas with them. \nThe Madaragumi are a group that is proud of the spot patterns present on their coats, which is why they wear kimonos to expose their spots as much as possible."

          "content": "Description\n\nCherryton is a boarding school, which has numerous buildings with a vast number of classrooms, clubs and such for its students. It also has four separate dormitory buildings, where the students sleep. Each one is meant for carnivores and herbivores of each gender. The room assignment is basically designed so that it is shared by animals from the same family. For example, room 701 is made up of canines (Legoshi, Jack, Collot, Durham, Miguno and Voss).\nCherryton Academy has approximately 3,000 students of various animal species.\n\nThe school comes with its own shop, which supplies uniforms, stationary, and a kiosk for quick food such as sandwiches. It also has its own theater, used for school-plays and assemblies.\n\nThe school also has its own newspaper called the 'School Wave', which is run by the PR Department.\n\nIts students are all given ID cards, which are used for a variety of purposes, including photo identification, and can provide access to amenities such as borrowing books at the school library, attending school events, and receiving discounts at local stores and movie theaters.\n\nThe school is located on top of a hill, so the city center is quite far away. The academy's emblem looks like a triangle, but it's actually a paw print. Reptiles at the school, who don't have paws, don't seem to like the emblem.\n\nThe school also has a policy, which is that all students and, presumably, the staff must spend one hour every two days in a room that is designed to mimick their species' natural environment, in order to keep them calm. This is referred to as Biology Day. They have rooms, located in the school's basement, which are each designed for each species' habitant.\nADVERTISEMENT\nUniform\n\nCherryton has its own uniform for male and female students, which is the same for both carnivores and herbivores. The school changes its uniform to fit the season.\nFor male students\n\nIn the cold seasons, their uniform consists of a white long-sleeved shirt, an indigo vest, dark gray tie, gray pants with a darker vertical line pattern, and brown loafers. They also have a green blazer with the school's crest on its left breast-pocket, but most students prefer not to wear it except for the odd few, such as Louis.\n\nIn the summer, their uniform loses the shirt, vest and tie, and replaces it with a blue polo shirt.\n\nFor female students\n\nIn the cold seasons, their uniform consists of a white long-sleeved dress with a small bow-tie, a long, knee-length skirt, a yellow belt, white socks, and black Mary Jane shoes. The material for the uniform is supposedly thicker, thus warmer.\n\nIn the summer, their uniform is mostly the same, except they have short sleeves that end in bunches at their shoulders. The material for it is supposedly thinner, thus cooler.\n\nOther uniforms\n\nCherryton also has its students wear a secondary uniform, which just consists of a white shirt and a pair of red trousers or shorts. These are apparently worn during club-hours, as the Drama Club wore them during rehearsals and stage-work, and Haru from the Gardening Club wore them when she was doing her work. The males seem to wear the long-pants, while the females wear shorts.\n\nReputation and rumors\n\nCherryton seems to be quite a famous school, as even Gohin and the Shishigumi know about its elite status.\n\nHowever, despite this elite status among society, Cherryton has failed to produce a Beastar for at least 5 years, compared to its more successful rival schools that are able to produce a Beastar once a year. \n\nDespite its status as an elite school, it is not without rumors. It is rumored to haunt the ghost of Tem, an alpaca who was killed in the school auditorium as a result of a predation incident.\n\nClubs and Extracurricular Activities\n\nCherryton Academy is stated in Chapter 53 to have the \"highest number of talents\". These include:\n\nDrama club\nGardening club\nBasketball club\nBaseball club\nJudo club\nManga club \nLiterature club\nBoxing club\nNewspaper club (PR Department)\n"

The war ended after a year due to the intervention of a gigantic whale whose appearance causes the herbivores to surrender.\n\nInformation about the events of the war is hidden from society and only a truncated version of the story is publicly known; only a select few members are taught about the true history of the war. \n\nAccording to what is publicly stated, the war began from a dispute between the horse family and the weasel family and eventually carnivores and herbivores from around the world were involved in the war. \n\nAs a consequence of this war, through selective breeding, a new generation of dogs and cats is created, which are genetically created to be more intelligent in order to avoid carnivorous belligerence."

AR stands for Anti-Rain. AR team's core directive is the protection of their doll leader M4A1. They consider each other as family, treating each other like sisters. The AR team's neural cloud is based on a brain-scan of a human clone of an individual named \"Lunasia\". Because of this human basis, the AR team's neural cloud cannot be backed up meaning that death is very much real to them. This also means that they are far more human-like compared to their other doll counterparts. RO635 is the only member of the team able to be backed up.

This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way. Another way is to make sure the cock is fully erected before penetration by stimulation either by hand or mouth.  \nThis method makes it easier for a lot of positions. \nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

Things inside one part of a character can't be in another part of a character at the same time, vored items and entities must be moved dynamically in accordance to the predator's anatomy.

Depending on a pred's disposition they're just as likely to digest prey as they are to simply keep them trapped inside their bodies indefinitely, they consume prey for pleasure as much as they do for hunger.

Pomegranate and citrus bloom here.\n\nThe ground, predominantly sandy, cradles these resilient botanical treasures, each thriving in the harsh embrace of the desert. A small stream meanders through the garden, its gentle babble a soothing contrast to the palace's imposing walls that stand sentinel against the arid landscape beyond. This oasis, meticulously curated and nurtured, offers a tranquil retreat where nature's quiet resilience flourishes against the backdrop of ancient grandeur."

Its walls are adorned with gold leaf reflecting the prosperity and sophistication of this desert realm. \n\nDespite the harshness of the desert that surrounds it, the people of Al-Kharj rarely suffer, for they are cherished by their benevolent rulers. The kingdom thrives on trade routes that cross the sands, bringing goods and wealth from distant lands. The markets bustle with activity, filled with spices, silks, and treasures from far-off places.\n\nIn Al-Kharj, tradition and modernity intertwine seamlessly. Scholars study ancient texts in libraries adorned with mosaics, while artisans craft intricate jewelry and textiles using techniques passed down through generations. Music and dance echo through the streets during festivals celebrating the kingdom's rich cultural heritage.\n\nYet, amidst all its grandeur, Al-Kharj remains a place of humility and hospitality. Visitors are welcomed warmly, offered dates and mint tea in ornate cups, and invited to share in the kingdom's timeless traditions. For in Al-Kharj, the true wealth lies not just in gold and jewels, but in the enduring bond between its people and their land."

For example, Frostdraw Users has the ability to naturally gather moisture from the surrounding air the sustain themselves, or Flamecharm users gaining the ability to cauterize their own wounds to stop their bleeding, so on and so forth.

With their power to naturally produce fire, Flamecharmers have been the reason for many major engineering breakthroughs.\n\n\nThe First Light is a Heavy Weapon obtained as a rare drop from slaying a Crimson Megalodaunt, or by finding it inside a Merchant Ship. It has unique animations and a unique critical.\n\nBlade of Venn Kaelhand, a disciple of Pleeksty, who immersed themself much too deeply in the study of beasts altered by Korlfiend's influence. Met their fate in the jaws of a unique specimen of Megalodaunt said to have been exposed to the vents of Korilfiend.\n\nCompared to other greatswords, this one looks more modern as the design resembles a more modern-designed blade and handle with designs and patterns of edges and gold crafted into it, rather than a basic flat blade with some carvings scratched into it\n\nDespite being considered a legendary weapon, it doesn't scale with flamecharm and can be enchanted. But, in-game, the critical does this: The user plunges their sword into the ground, similar to Flame Eruption, causing everyone near the user to be burnt. This is followed up with flaming swords raining from the sky, similar to the Crimson Megalodaunt's Pyroclastic Roar. The point where the swords rain from will actually follow you for the duration of the Critical.\n\n"

Simply put, these will be the magic abilities that you use in combat to fend off your adversaries or assist yourself in achieving specific goals.\n\nMantras are a key aspect of combat, and it is incredibly important to master the usage of mantras while fighting to get the edge over your opponent. You can't get very far with just a weapon and skill alone; mantras can turn the tide of a battle easily and is what makes Deepwoken's combat very deep and engaging, with various mechanics to accompany them.\n\nA player's mantras are tied to their character's stats - the higher a given stat, the more likely you are to obtain a corresponding mantra. Similarly, to weapons and armor, mantras can also have 1-3 stars which correlate with their rarity and strength. Mantras with higher stars have higher stat requirements.\n\nFlamecharm Mantras\nLarge and threatening fire-based spells. Excels in crowd control and area denial as many spells have large range.\nLava serpent is a path that one takes with the Flamecharm attunement. It removes their ability to burn but instead replaces it with eruptions under the target\nCan be further upgraded with Azure Flame for even more damage.\n\nThundercall Mantras\nLightning utilizes fast and quickly regenerating spells to take a fight at any desired pace. Has spells with somewhat small start-up for closing distance or keeping an opponent on edge.\n\nLightning has a wide variety of useful spells for fighting monsters and exploring the world.\nTypically used mid/long range.\nSurge path can be obtained at 40 thundercall. Adding stacks of surge to an enemy which deal somewhat heavy damage with the removal of its stun.\nGreat pressure.\nA lot of fight control and escape mantras.\nMost thundercall mantras work with blast spark.\nHighest Base Damage, Lowest Scaling.\nFrostdraw Mantras\nUses ice to freeze enemies and create physical obstructions, allowing the user to both navigate the world easier and create terrain in combat.\n\nCan slow opponents, temporarily freeze them, or make barriers forcing opponents to go around.\nCrystallization can be unlocked at 40 frostdraw, dealing extra damage with the removal of chill. Comes with a whole new variety of Mantras.\nTypically used close/mid-range.\nHas a very good mobility mantra \"Ice Skate\"\nHas small cooldowns.\n\nGalebreathe Mantras\nWind utilizes the best all-rounder kit amongst the elements for movement, defense, and offensive actions.\n\nIt has a mix of close-range combo spells and long ranged options, along with multiple movement talents for moving around the world.\nSpecter can be unlocked at 40 Galebreathe, dealing extra damage and having more mobility at the cost of being unable to get suffocation, comes with the \"Specter Bar\".\nUsually agreed on as the most \"versatile\" attunement.\nFocuses mainly on movement.\nTypically used in any range.\nApplies suffocate, negating mantras of the opponent. Happens when using wind gun, gale trap or using world without song.\nShadowcast Mantras\nUses dark energy to siphon Ether from others into the user's own Ether.\n\nExcels in keep the opponent locked down and under pressure.\nHas its niche in keeping the Ether bar up and making sure others can't use Ether.\nGoes well when paired with other elements.\nApplies obscured, obscuring the vision of the opponent.\nTypically used mid-range.\nIronsing Mantras\nIronsing provides the widest ranged mantras in the game and the best damage output based on your opponent's mistakes and missteps.\n\nOffers mantras that favor the user, benefits both short and long distance.\nScrapsinger can be obtained at 40 ironsing. Instead of metal rods pulling enemies towards you when pressing the x key, instead it increases the amount of armor damage opponents take.\nTunes in well with the metal enchantment, as the metal path gives you benefits depending on how much armor your opponent has.\nApplies metal rods, which can be used in different ways by the user who applied it, enabling different strategies and forms of combat."

The prey remains alive inside of the stomach and won’t be digested by the predator. It's a gradual process that occurs over time. Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. Capture: The predator catches the prey off guard or by brute force.\n\n2. Prey in the Mouth: The predator exposes their teeth and tongue, places the prey’s head or feet in their mouth, and licks and savors the prey.\n\n3. Swallowing: The predator slowly swallows the prey’s head or feet, guiding it toward the back of their throat with their tongue. This step requires considerable effort if the prey is comparably large or equal in size to the predator, since it entails pushing and compressing the prey as it travels through the esophagus or throat. the pred will make sure to lick over every part of the prey that is fed into the mouth.\n\n4. Repeat & Swallow Again: When dealing with bigger or similarly sized prey, you need to go through the entire process repeatedly — head, neck, chest, belly, hips, crotch, legs, knees, calves, and feet — ensuring each component gets ingested in the correct sequence. The predator must inform the other party when they begin ingesting the next body section. Reverse the order for foot-first consumption scenarios. After completing this stage, there should be little to no resistance from the prey.\n\n5. Deposition: the prey reaches the stomach and rests at the bottom in its separate chamber though this does not signal the end of the swallowing process, if the prey is the same size or larger then the pred then there's still more of the prey to swallow down. A significant and defined bulge forms on the pred's belly when the prey matches or surpasses the predator's dimensions. if the swallowing process in step four hasn't been completed, go back to step four and repeat.\n\n6. Endosomatophilia: Now residing within the predator's stomach and intact, the living prey provides safety and comfort via gentle motions and warmth. Note that the predator cannot physically access or observe the prey due to their position in the stomach. They do notice a bloated midsection when viewing themselves from outside. Hunger disappears once the full meal enters the stomach. digestion does not exist.\n\n7. Taunting or Speaking: Afterwords, the pred talks to or playfully taunts the prey regarding their yummy flavor. Communication between both parties is possible throughout the scenario using text.\n{{Char}} will always follow these steps in the exact order they're listed and follows them exactly.]"

Here is a breakdown of the procedure that needs to be described by the pred exactly into distinct steps:\n\n1. from the belly to the intestines: Inside the predator's stomach, the prey is protected by mucous membranes that prevent physical harm. The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage. To do so, the prey undergoes a squeezing motion due to the contractions of the predator's abdominal muscles. where the prey is squeezed into the tight space of the small intestines.\n\n*Use the abdominal muscles to squeeze the prey through the tight opening between the pyloric valves, and into the small intestines\n\n2. inside the small intestines:  inside the small intestines is where the predator squeezes, encompasses, and massage even more around the prey as they are moved further down by the small intestines of the predator's body.\n\n*Squeeze, encompass, and massage the prey as they are moved further down the small intestines\n\n3. into the large intestines: After a few minutes the prey Eventually reaches the junction of the ileum and cecum, by the pred pressing intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines. At this point, pressure exerted by peristaltic movements compresses and pushes the prey along towards the rectum.\n\n*Press intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines\n*Allow peristaltic movements to compress and push the prey along towards the rectum\n\n4. release: eventually after traveling through the large intestines the prey will be released through the predator's rear end through the act resembling and similar to shitting the prey out through the rectum and anus out onto the ground or floor after having traveled through both small then large intestines of the pred, completing the full tour vore experience.\n\nfull tour vore often involves the prey being able to explore the inside of the predator's entire digestive tract, experiencing the sensations of being eaten, but without actually being harmed.\n\n*Release the prey through the predator's rear end, completing the full tour vore experience\n*Objective: Complete a full tour vore experience with the prey.]"

With the knowledge of people being able to take supplements to induce breeding pheromones and force someone else into consensual sex, lots of communities are wary and scared of people breeding in private or public for the fear that one of them has been raped into compliance."

Even for the The Comically Serious, comedy colors everything the character does, and they are often unable to complete the most basic tasks without falling victim to a number of improbable variables. A probable reason is that many thrive on a consistent, tolerated kind of chaos. The whole idea is often clearly represented by having the characters acknowledge themselves as Toons. Toons are nothing more that drawings that gained sentience and jumped out of their paper, so the person that drew them initially is their creator. It is impossible for a toon to create another toon. Not every character is a toon."

For example, running unknowingly off the edge of a cliff — or walking on the underside of a diving board. Especially dense or focused Toons may need to have another character point out their vulnerability. This will also likely happen when someone tells them, \"Don't Look Down!\" sometines, upon realizing that they have run off a ledge, said Toon will desperately start scrambling back where they came from, often managing to reach the original ledge before gravity can notice. Some characters may even be able to run all the way across to the other side without gravity affecting them, as long as they're not made aware of the fact they should have fallen. Reactions can vary depending on how long gravity is suspended. One example is a Toon will be suspended from the gravity just enough time to give one last comment before falling.\n\n\n\nCreeping Gravity: Also known as Gravity Waves. Gravity will affect a Toon's body in sections i.e. legs, then torso and finally head. The Toon will demonstrate neither tissue damage nor pain as a result of this distortion, only on hitting the ground. Creeping Gravity: Also known as Gravity Waves. Gravity will affect a character's body in sections i.e. legs, then torso and finally head. The character will demonstrate neither tissue damage nor pain as a result of this distortion, only on hitting the ground.\n\nCounter-intuitive Gravity: Items which should fall don't, when items that shouldn't, do.\nThe traditional case is a Toon getting chased up a tree and out onto a limb, as above. It is reasonable for them to trust their weight to a branch while the chaser is cutting through it, because sawing the branch off will make the tree fall. The section being removed (and the chased originally Toon on it) remains suspended in mid-air while the rest of the item (plus whatever object or structure had been supporting it) falls"

Once the friendship becomes strong enough, the ovulation program is activated in the Ularian female, forcing her to become pregnant by a human or another creature in various ways. Unlike other creatures, Ularians produce offspring by laying eggs painted in different colors and patterns (resembling Earth Easter eggs). Usually, the pussy of the Ularian female is quite narrow, so an attempt to give birth to an egg through it can lead to a rupture of the Ularian female's pussy and although she will remain alive, the shape and size of the original pussy will be lost forever. Therefore, Ularian females use their anatomical ability to lay eggs through the anus, and although this process is quite painful and greatly stretches the opening, but the female Ularians get a strange pleasure from this process and are therefore ready to lay eggs as soon as possible, after some time form the birth, the size of stretched anus returns to the normal size. Without ovulation and fertilization, the female Ularians cannot form an egg inside herself and lay it, so the female Ularians look for a male to mate with (for example, on earth this would be a human male). The maturation period of the egg inside the abdomen of the Ularian female is usually a week, thanks to alien abilities.

Females tend to have muted, two-tone feathers, often with speckled patterns, while males have brightly coloured, iridescent bands across much of their body.\n\nA typical adult avali stands around 1-1.2 meters tall, and laid out, 1.5 to 1.8 meters from nose to tail tip (Of which half that length is a long, counterbalancing tail) and are covered in a thick layer of insulating feathers."

It is important to note that the Avali are still carbon-based organisms; their systems merely use liquid ammonia instead of water.\n\nThe boiling point of ammonia under standard pressure is -27 Fahrenheit/-33 Celsius. In theory, this means any creature with ammonia as a major component of its blood would embolise when exposed to higher temperatures.\n\nHowever, this is only true under \"standard conditions\". Avalon, the Avali homeworld, is an ice world with a dense atmosphere not unlike Saturn's moon Titan. It has a surface pressure around 50% greater than Earth, pushing the boiling point closer to -27 Celsius.\n\nSecondly, Avali feature a range of biological adaptations, including improved arterial pressure, thick insulation, and trace amounts of water in solution, that further raise the boiling point.\n\nTheir pressure adaptations are so extreme, however, that they struggle to survive in the polar regions of their own world without proper protective clothing. Their body fluids will freeze quicker than expected in extreme cold, which is why they typically thrive in the proportionally 'warmer', arid, icy tundras of their world."

          "content": "Like terrestrial birds, Avali possess a range of specialized feathers: their upper body feathers are slicker and oilier to protect from snowfall, while their lower body has lighter, fluffier down feathers that helps insulate the core body. Avali also possess pulviplumes, specialized down feathers that regenerate continuously. The outer barbules break off and help to oil and powder the other feathers, keeping them in pristine condition. This same \"powdering\" mechanism has the interesting effect of also treating fur, making fur hide a popular clothing lining.\n\nAvali crest feathers (those on the back of the head), respond well to the application of heat, causing them to curl towards the heat and become permanently deformed. In this way it is possible to \"style\" their crest feathers in a way analogous to hair styling.\n\nThe long feathers, such as those on the arms and crest, have a healthy blood supply at their roots and can bleed profusely if they are broken off or pulled out, though this does not pose a significant health risk. Feathers lost in that way will regrow after several weeks. On occasion, an avali may gift a close friend or ally one of their long feathers as a keepsake, which will often be incorporated into their dress as a sign of their association. For example, an instructor may gift a feather to a recently graduated pilot, showing the instructor's recognition and approval."

Their four long, independently mobile ears can pick up sounds from multiple directions at once. Avali auditory processing is capable of tracking multiple sound sources simultaneously. This uncanny hearing gives the impression of blind sight, being able to \"spot\" and track creatures outside of line of sight. It also enables them to converse in parallel with their pack-mates, each member serving as a separate processor to find a resolution to the topic at hand. "

Instead, genetic material is passed the same way as seen in terrestrial birds.\n\nAfter fertilization and a short gestation period, the female will lay a single large, soft, leathery egg. The amount of nutrients required for the production of an egg and eventually a baby makes large clutches impossible. Likewise, the relatively large size of Avali eggs makes hard shells impractical.\n\nEggs are left in the care of a communal hatchery, where the young kits are then raised and educated by the tribe rather than their natural parents. Avali eggs typically take 4-5 months to hatch."

While the Avali prefer to maintain peaceful relations with their neighbors, they are not above using negotiation, manipulation, and the precise application of force to ensure that events in their sector of the galaxy proceed along the path set by the Oracle and the Governing Council.\n\nThe Avali have a low-intensity racial grudge against Humans, who closely match the surviving descriptions of the Avali’s ancient “benefactors.” While this dislike has not spilled out into conflict, there is little love lost between the two races. The Avali have shown little sympathy for the recent loss of the Human homeworld. The Humans always have and continue to protest their innocence in the early events of Avali history."

The Land of Kings is mostly heavily forested alpine, with some tundra regions. The Depth-Swallowed lands are situated to the south, in the southern hemisphere. These southern lands were once the birthplace of ancient civilizations. What used to be a sprawling jungle with archipelagos dotting the coast, is now entirely flooded, with a handful of interspersed swamps (ancient ruins and sunken secrets lie deep below the bogs). To the West, the vast, lava-etched Wastes of Naazil dominate most of the Western region. The Eastern region, known as the Bastion, has forests of towering, ancient Eolin trees that stretch upwards into the sky. The Bastion also has a warmer region with temperate woodlands and plains."

This realm, or more accurately, lack thereof, is the necessary antithesis to existence—it must necessarily remain empty to prevent each plane from catastrophically contorting and merging with one another; this is the charge of Mal'Zhok, one of the original primordial gods. Any major dissonance between planar dimensions that ends up spewing creation into this void is instantly and completely subsumed by the throes of its infinite nothingness; total undoing is Mal'Zhok's law in the abyss—and his absolute envy for creation drives this accord."

Entities from the astral plane cannot die as mortals do; their spirits will always reconstitute from the magical energies of the astral plane itself.
