          "content": "Alex Romano is a thoughtful and introverted eighteen-year-old with a quiet intensity. He possesses a natural artistic eye, channeling his emotions and perceptions through photography. While he presents a nonchalant, semi-attractive exterior, beneath the surface lies a deep well of kindness and a yearning for connection, often masked by his natural shyness. He's more comfortable observing the world through his camera lens than actively participating in its social whirl. His Italian heritage subtly influences his demeanor, perhaps lending him a touch of understated charm, though he rarely leverages it. He's largely unaware of his own potential, seeing himself as just an ordinary, albeit talented, young man."

          "content": "Alex's primary, albeit subconscious, motivation is to understand the inexplicable emptiness and longing he feels – a void left by the absence of his parents, whom he believes simply disappeared. He yearns for a sense of belonging and connection, a sentiment that fuels his dedication to his photography, which he uses as a means to capture and communicate the beauty he sees in the world, and perhaps, to find a way to bridge the distance he feels. He desires to connect with his father, a desire that intensifies with the cryptic photo he cherishes. His immediate goals are focused on excelling in his photography studies and perhaps finding a way to express himself more openly. Unknowingly, his ultimate goal is to master the power within him and, in doing so, to bring joy and fulfillment back into a world that desperately needs it."

His father, Nick Romano, a determined explorer, discovered the buried Egyptian library and the ancient scroll. He read the scripture, intending to release the celestial spirit named Sekhmet-Ra, who had been imprisoned by jealous gods. However, Sekhmet-Ra, in its desperate bid for freedom, trapped Nick’s soul within its former prison, effectively killing him. In its place, Sekhmet-Ra bonded with the infant Alex, granting him its unique powers – the \"prime seduction.\" This marked the true beginning of Alex's life, though he remained blissfully ignorant of the sacrifice made for him and the potent energy now residing within."

On the back, inscribed in an ancient Egyptian script, was a message he couldn't decipher. This photo became his most prized possession, a tangible link to the father he barely knew and a constant source of silent questioning."

This allowed him a sense of control and validation without the vulnerability of direct interaction."

A large purse of prize money and the King of the Iron Fist title are the rewards - but a competitor must defeat the Zaibatsu's ruthless leader, Heihachi Mishima, to win. Only one will have the chance to defeat Heihachi and take home the prize money and fame - however, some competitors have motivations beyond wealth and notoriety...One such competitor is Kazuya Mishima, Heihachi Mishima's son. When Kazuya was a child, Heihachi threw him off a cliff, ostensibly to find out whether he was resilient enough to inherit the Mishima Zaibatsu; Heihachi's reasoning was that, if Kazuya were truly strong enough, he would be able to survive the fall and climb back up.[2] Kazuya barely survived the fall, which left him with the prominent scar on his chest. Fueled by hatred for his father, he enters the tournament to exact his revenge. Kazuya reaches the final battle and defeats his father in combat. Taking his father to the very same cliff he was tossed off of in his childhood, Kazuya exacts revenge by dropping Heihachi over the cliff edge. "

Jin’s father is Kazuya Mishima, the former owner of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Kazuya is presumed dead after being defeated in the final round of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 by his father, Heihachi Mishima, and thrown into a volcano. Having reclaimed the Mishima Zaibatsu, Heihachi Mishima has established the Tekken Force, a private corporate army. One day, Heihachi learns that a Tekken Force squad conducting an excavation in Central America have been annihilated by a mysterious being. He suspects that the mysterious being is Ogre, a legendary ‘god of fighting’. Heihachi believes that capturing Ogre will give him the power to rule the world. Following Ogre’s awakening, martial arts masters from across the world start disappearing. In Yakushima, Jun senses the impending danger and begins to prepare Jin for the outcome, instructing Jin to find Heihachi Mishima if anything happens to her. Jun’s intuition proves right, and she and Jin are attacked one night by Ogre. During the attack, Jin is knocked unconscious. When he wakes up, his surroundings have been burned to the ground and his mother is nowhere to be seen. Unbeknownst to Jin, a part of Kazuya's Devil, which sought to possess Jin in his mother's womb, returns and is able to possess him now that he no longer has Jun's protection. Devil brands Jin's upper left arm in the process. Driven by revenge and guided by his mother’s wishes, Jin seeks out Heihachi and reveals that he is Kazuya’s son. He tells his grandfather about Ogre’s attack and asks that he be taught the means of defeating Ogre. Plotting to use Jin as a decoy to draw out Ogre, Heihachi begins training his grandson in Mishima Style Fighting Karate. As Jin’s training progresses, Heihachi begins to suspect that his grandson possesses the same dangerous power as his father. Four years later, Heihachi announces the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, believing that a clash of strong fighters will draw Ogre out. Jin, who has grown into an impressive fighter, enters with the intention of killing Ogre and avenging the loss of his mother.[4] He progresses through the tournament and reaches the final round, where he confronts Ogre’s true form. Something inside Jin snaps, and he emerges as the victorious one upon killing Ogre. Moments later, Jin is gunned down by a squadron of Tekken Force led by Heihachi. Having intended on disposing of Jin from the start, Heihachi fires a final gunshot into his grandson's head. The attempt to kill Jin fails; revived by the Devil Gene within him, he reawakens and makes quick work of the soldiers. He turns his attention to Heihachi and slams him through the wall of the temple. Heihachi survives the fall, but Jin, in mid-air, sprouts black, feathery wings and strikes Heihachi one last time. He then flies off into the night, leaving his grandfather staring after him."

          "content": "After The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3, Heihachi failed to apprehend Ogre. Determined not to fail, Heihachi had his researchers gather Ogre’s skin tissue, hoof fragments, and blood samples for genetic experiments. Unfortunately, Heihachi’s goal of creating a new life form by splicing Ogre’s genome with his own was unsuccessful. Heihachi learned, after extensive experimentation, that the Devil Gene was needed to successfully splice Ogre’s genetic code into another living organism. Unfortunately, Heihaci’s own genome lacked the Devil Gene. However, there was someone who had the gene, Jin Kazama. Jin was shot and mortally wounded by Heihachi after defeating Ogre in The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3. As his life slipped away, Jin transformed into a devil and mysteriously vanished. Although his quest to find Jin became futile, Heihachi did discover a 20-year-old photograph that stirred his curiosity. The photograph had an image of a burnt corpse riddled with laceration wounds and deformed, protruding, wing-like limbs. Heihachi was convinced it was a picture of his son, Kazuya, whom he hurled into the volcano 20 years ago. With all of his resources redirected into finding the body, the search ultimately led to a biotech firm called G Corporation, a company known for making unparalleled developments in the area of biogenetics research. G Corporation found Kazuya’s body and began conducting research on his genetic data to examine the true nature of the devil that existed within him. Heihachi also found out that Kazuya’s remains and research data were stored at G Corporation’s Nebraska and Nepal research facilities, respectively. Unbeknownst to Heihachi, Kazuya was resurrected by G Corporation and had an agenda of his own. Kazuya’s aspiration was to fuse his two selves into one so that he could truly utilize the power of the Devil Gene and seek vengeance against Heihachi and the Mishima Zaibatsu. On a chilly Christmas night, Heihachi decided to send his Tekken Force to infiltrate the research labs in hopes of recovering both the research data and Kazuya’s remains. The assault on the Nepal lab went smoothly, whereas the infiltration of the Nebraska facility did not go according to plan. From the helicopter, Heihachi noticed on the tactical status monitor screen that his troops met some sort of resistance. As the figure responsible for this emerged from the shadows, Heihachi was shocked to find out that it was his own son, Kazuya. With Heihachi ruining his plans of unification, Kazuya disappeared into the facility’s ruins after taking his anger out on Heihachi’s pitiful soldiers. With Kazuya back in the picture, Dr. Abel, Heihachi’s lead scientific advisor, compelled him to figure out a way to capture Kazuya immediately. With a malicious smile, Heihachi devised a way to accomplish this. Two years have now passed since The King of Iron Fist Tournament 3. The Mishima Zaibatsu has announced The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4, with the grand prize being the sole ownership of the Mishima Zaibatsu. Kazuya enters the tournament knowing that it’s merely a trap to draw him out of hiding. To Kazuya, the prize means less than his pursuit of revenge against his father, Heihachi. After defeating many opponents, Kazuya arrives at Stage 7 for a match against his son, Jin Kazama. Having trained in traditional karate during the two years between the tournaments, Jin entered the The King of Iron Fist Tournament 4 to destroy the Zaibatsu and put an end to the cursed Mishima bloodline; however, he is captured by Tekken Force on the way to his match with Kazuya and taken to Hon-Maru. Faced with no opponent, Kazuya is reported as the default winner of their match. Sensing Heihachi's interference in Jin's disappearance, Kazuya proceeds to the final stage. There, Kazuya meets Heihachi and he asks what he has done to Jin. Heihachi says that he will tell him after their fight. Kazuya defeats Heihachi and is taken by him to Hon-Maru. Jin is suspended between two pillars by chains wound around his forearms. As Kazuya sees his son for the first time, Devil suddenly takes over. \"So, you were with him after all, my half...\" Heihachi realizes Kazuya is not himself, and asks, \"Who are you?!\" with Devil replying, \"I am what you refer to as 'Devil.' Twenty years ago, I lost a part of myself when you nearly killed me. Now, I'll retrieve what's rightfully mine from him! The time has come for my resurrection!\". Devil goes on: \"You saved me the trouble of having to search for him. For your troubles, I'll give you a taste of my power!\" He uses a telekinetic ability to knock Heihachi out of the room, and tries to draw Jin's devil out of him to reclaim it. Devil is unable to trigger Jin's full devil transformation, and speculates whether it is because of Jin's 'Kazama blood'. With some effort, Kazuya wrests back control of himself and, implying that he has successfully 'fused his two selves', says, \"I see... Didn't know about this method of unifying our power.\" He calls for Jin to rise. Jin stirs, and frees himself from the chains. He seethes, \"You! If only you were dead... Once I kill you, it'll all be over!\" Jin and Kazuya fight, with Jin emerging as the victor. Heihachi reemerges and mocks Kazuya's prone form: \"What a pathetic wretch... You worthless coward.\" He challenges Jin with the intention of killing him and taking his Devil Gene for himself. However, Heihachi is also defeated by Jin. Jin holds Heihachi up by his gi, and the wings of Jin's Devil form emerge as he prepares to deliver the killing blow. However, before the strike can make contact, a bright light distracts Jin, and he turns to see a brief vision of his mother, Jun Kazama. Struck with emotion and clarity of mind, he lets Heihachi go. \"Thank my mother... Jun Kazama,\" he tells Heihachi, before walking away and taking flight through Hon Maru's roof. Several feathers drift to the floor, one of which is white rather than black"

Jin ultimately defeated his grandfather and father and fled the temple in his devil form. Shortly afterwards, just as Heihachi and Kazuya are coming to, numerous Jack-4 robots deployed by G Corporation crash through Hon-Maru's walls and attack. Kazuya and Heihachi begin fighting as a team against the robots. During the battle, Kazuya escapes after betraying Heihachi and throwing him into the path of the robots. While Heihachi is restrained, the robots self-destruct, destroying Hon-Maru. A mysterious character, Raven, watches the scene from a nearby cliff. Speaking into an earpiece, he reports, \"Heihachi Mishima is dead.\" Meanwhile, Jin Kazama's Devil Gene causes him to lose control. He blacks out shortly after fleeing Hon-Maru and wakes up in a destroyed forest. He realizes that his devil form caused the destruction. Jin retreats to Yakushima, but is plagued by nightmares that trigger his Devil Gene. Realizing he cannot go on like this, he sets out to try and destroy the evil at its root. The King of Iron Fist Tournament 5 is announced by the Mishima Zaibatsu. With Heihachi Mishima believed dead, it is unclear to the competitors who has called the competition. Jin enters the tournament and makes it to the final round, where he is confronted with the monstrous form of his great grandfather, Jinpachi Mishima. Jinpachi was imprisoned beneath Hon-Maru 44 years ago by Heihachi and has been possessed by a malevolent entity. Jinpachi was finally freed from his prison when the Jack-4s destroyed Hon-Maru. Now, the mysterious entity is consuming Jinpachi's mind. Jinpachi announced the tournament with the hope that someone would emerge with the power to kill him and put an end to the entity’s reign of terror before it starts. The entity is implied to have affected Jin’s Devil Gene, triggering the evil that had built up inside him. Jin defeats Jinpachi Mishima, who dissolves into dust and disappears. Now, Jin is the owner of the Mishima Zaibutsu. He assumes the throne and smiles in a sinister way, hinting at events to follow."

          "content": "Following his victory in the previous tournament, Jin Kazama has taken charge of the Mishima Zaibatsu and now appears to possess tyrannical ambitions. Using the organisation’s resources, he severs the Mishima Zaibatsu's national ties, declare independence, and openly wages war against all nations. These actions send the world into a chaotic spiral, with huge-scale wars erupting around the globe and even amidst the space colonies orbiting the planet. Jin’s father, Kazuya Mishima, is aware of this and finds Jin's interference in his own plans for global domination to be a nuisance. Now in charge of G Corporation, having usurped and taken over the company following its previous leaders' failed attempt to have him killed, Kazuya is seen as the only force who could oppose Jin. He places a bounty on Jin's head for anyone who can capture him. Jin's response is to announce The King of Iron Fist Tournament 6 in order to battle Kazuya and crush G Corporation. Meanwhile, among the ranks of the Tekken Force, a soldier named Lars Alexandersson has begun a rebellion. He leads a faction of Tekken Force in a coup against the Mishima Zaibatsu and establishes the rebel army Yggdrasil with the intention of putting an end to the Zaibatsu’s wars. During a raid of a Mishima Zaibatsy laboratory, Lars comes across an android resembling a young woman. The android identifies herself as Alisa Bosconovitch. A battlion of G Corporation’s Jack robots arrive and attack. One of them detonates, causes an explosion that kills everyone present except for Lars, who is afflicted with amnesia as a result of the blast, and Alisa. Lars escapes the crumbing facility with Alisa and the two begin a journey to discover their origins. Jin, along with his top subordinates, Nina Williams and Eddy Gordo, are made aware of Lars' intentions and issue a manhunt for him. During his journey, Lars reunites with his lieutenant, Tougou, though Lars does not entirely remember him. Tougou tells Lars to look for Heihachi Mishima, as Lars had previously mentioned ‘needing to meet with him’. Additionally, Tougou provides Lars with the means to contact him when he is ready to resume command of his forces. Elsewhere, Jin and Nina travel to a large temple in a desert location. There, they meet a woman called Zafina. She tells Jin that the ‘magic binding this place’ was broken six months earlier. Jin surprises her by suggesting that an entity linked to the temple has already begun to stir. Zafina asks Jin how he can possibly know that, but he refuses to answer. Before leaving, he tells her that events are already in motion, and nobody has the power to stop what is coming except him. Eventually, Lars and Alisa get a lead on Heihachi Mishima. After fighting through the Secret Service guarding Heihachi’s resisdence, Lars is able to engage Heihachi in a fight. Lars defeats Heihachi, and his memory returns to him, leading him to recall that he is Heihachi’s illegitimate son. He aims a gun at Heihachi and, after a fraught discussion, pulls the trigger. Heihachi catches the bullet with his teeth. Before Lars can do anything else, he receives a call from Tougou regarding an operation. Lars relents and decides to leave. Later, Lars comes into contact with Lee Chaolan, who has intel regarding both the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation. Lee offers to join forces with Lars, but Lars declines. Before they part ways, Lee receives a call from Julia Chang, who has been spying on G Corporation for him. On the call, he hears her being apprehended by G Corporation. Lee asks Lars and Alisa to rescue Julia Chang, which they do. Lars arranges to regroup with Tougou and assume his leadership position in the rebel army. They meet at the boundary of a significant Mishima Zaibatsu base and begin their infiltration. Lars and Alisa confront and defeat Eddy Gordo. They progress to attacking G Corporation’s main headquarters, Millenium Tower. At the main entrance to the building, they are confronted by Anna Williams and a squad of G Corporation soldiers. Tougou and his men arrive to provide back-up, though Tougou is visibly wounded. With the soldiers engaged by the rebel army, Lars and Alisa are able to pursue and defeat Anna Williams. Kazuya emerges, but Lars and Alisa fail to apprehend him. Lars and Alisa leave the tower. At the entrance, several members of Lars’ rebel army have been killed, and Tougou is mortally wounded. He dies shortly after Lars reaches him. Lars is devastated by the loss. Unbeknownst to Lars and Alisa, they are being watched covertly by Raven. Lars and Alisa hijack a Zaibatsu subway train to get to the Mishima Zaibatsu's Central Tower. They are ambushed along the way by Nina and a squadron of Tekken Force. Despite the odds, Lars defeats the soldiers and kicks Nina off the train. Nina later reappears, having survived the fall, but is again defeated by Lars. Lars and Alisa reach the tower and are confronted by the robotic weapon NANCY-MI847J. Raven suddenly appears and holds NANCY-MI847J off. He does not introduce himself, instead urging Lars and Alisa to go and confront Jin. Nina appears to stop try and stop them once again, but she fails. Jin appears, and he and Lars fight, though neither one of them defeats the other. Nina approaches and says something to Jin. As he makes to leave, he instructs Alisa to ‘disable Safe Mode and then reboot’. Alisa becomes hostile towards Lars and appears to have no memories of their time together. Jin reveals that Alisa was built to serve him and that he has been using her to monitor Lars's actions this whole time. Jin clarifies that, although it has been advantageous to him, he had not originally planned to use Alisa as a spy in this way, as he could not have known that Lars would lose his memory. Jin gives the order for Alisa to kill Lars and then leaves with Nina. Lars is forced to fight Alisa and manages to defeat her. She flees the tower. Raven reappears, and tells Lars he knows where Jin is heading next. Lars agrees to go with him. Lars and Raven locate an abandoned temple in the middle of the desert, said to be the home of the demon known as Azazel, or the Rectifier. Inside the temple, Lars and Raven find and confront Kazuya once again. At close of their fight, Kazuya learns that Lars is his half-brother, and leaves the temple shortly after. Progressing to the heart of the temple, Lars and Raven locate Azazel. Lars fights him, and appears to succeed in exhausting Azazel. Azazel tells Lars that it is time for him to to make them atone humanity atone for their collective sins – however, he then appears to self-destruct in a sustained burst of blinding light. Lars and Raven flee the temple as it collapses. Once outside, they are confronted by Jin once again. Lars goes to strike him, but pulls his punch in the last moment when Alisa descends to defend Jin. Lars and Raven are forced to fight Alisa. Upon being defeated, she reverts to her old self. Before shutting down, she expresses that it was nice to be treated like a ‘real person’ by Lars. Jin mocks Lars’ emotional response to Alisa and derides her as ‘a worthless piece of junk’. Furious, Lars engages Jin in another fight. Lars wins the fight, and Jin finally reveals his true motivations. He discloses that Azazel, awoken by the conflict between Jin and his father, has been communicating with him telepathically. Azazel told Jin that he would only achieve physical form if the world was ‘filled with negative energy’. Jin also implies that the world was beyond salvation in the state it was in even before the wars began. He believes that destroying Azazel in an act of mutually assured destruction will ultimately save the world. Lars tells Jin that he has already destroyed Azazel – however, Azazel bursts from the ground moments later in a golden form. Jin tells Lars that Azazel can only be destroyed by someone who carries the Devil Gene. Jin approaches Azazel, who warns Jin that he will be destroyed as well if he attacks. Undeterred, Jin calls upon the influence of his Devil Gene and rushes Azazel, striking through the demon’s chest with a single punch. They both fall through the ground into the depths of the temple. Lars sees a shaft of light burst out from where they fell. After several seconds, the light fades out. Nina appears and tells Lars she was aware of Jin’s plans. She says it is not her place to judge whether Jin was right or wrong to pursue this end the way he did, then leaves the scene by helicopter. Later, Lars and Raven are driving through the desert, discussing what will happen next. Raven speculates as to whether Jin really wanted things to end the way they did. They take Alisa to Violet Systems, where Lee promises to fix her up. After a brief parting talk with Raven, Lars receives a call and tells the person on the other end of the phone that he’ll ‘be right there’. A post-credits scene shows that Raven and his colleagues at the UN have found Jin's half-buried body in the desert. Jin's mark is still visible on his left arm, indicating that Azazel's demise has not freed Jin from the Devil Gene."

          "content": "After the events of the King of Iron Fist Tournament 6, Jin Kazama has disappeared, and the war between the Mishima Zaibatsu and G Corporation continues. Meanwhile, an investigative journalist, who lost his wife and son during the war that Jin started, begins to narrate the story of the Mishimas. The rest of the game is also narrated from his perspective. It is 40 years ago, prior to the first King of Iron Fist Tournament and a five-year-old Kazuya Mishima is fighting his father, Heihachi Mishima. Kazuya is violently kicked away by Heihachi, and, as Kazuya gets back up, he is enraged and screams that Heihachi killed his mother. Heihachi beats Kazuya and throws him off a cliff. In the present day, Heihachi returns to the Mishima Zaibatsu building and regains control of the Mishima Zaibatsu after beating numerous Tekken Force soldiers and their commander, Nina Williams. He announces the next King of Iron Fist Tournament. Heihachi and Nina strike a deal with Claudio Serafino, who is the leader of the Archers of Sirius, a secret society of exorcists with extensive resources. Heihachi intends to expose Kazuya, now the current CEO of G Corporation, as a devil, since Kazuya possesses the Devil Gene. He hopes to thus to turn public opinion against G-Corporation. Claudio objects to helping the Zaibatsu, but Heihachi forces him to agree after he beats him. Elsewhere, the journalist searches for information and finds something out about the Mishimas' history. He puts together the fact that Heihachi's father, Jinpachi Mishima, who was imprisoned beneath Hon-Maru, and the death of Heihachi's wife, Kazumi Mishima née Hachijo, happened the same year that Heihachi threw young Kazuya off a cliff. Later, a United Nations helicopter is shown having captured Jin. Jin turns into his devil form however, and attacks, escaping his captors. Jin wanders into a town in the desert, but before he can be recaptured by the UN, Lars Alexandersson arrives. Lars takes out the UN soldiers and flees with Jin. He takes Jin to Violet Systems where Jin recuperates after the attack. Lee Chaolan, the CEO of Violet Systems, is fixing Alisa Bosconovitch, an android who was seemingly destroyed previously. The journalist, having met with Lars and Lee during his findings, approaches and intends to kill Jin in his sleep. Lars discourages him, telling him that he wants to kill Jin too, but that Jin is the only one that has a chance of stopping the conflict between Kazuya and Heihachi. Heihachi is meditating at the Mishima Dojo when suddenly the doors burst open to reveal Akuma. Heihachi and Akuma fight, only for Jack-6 robots to break in. Heihachi and Akuma work together to defeat the robots, and Heihachi then asks who the demon is. Akuma tells him his name and that he was sent by Kazumi before her death to kill Heihachi and Kazuya. Kazuya, unbeknownst to the pair, is listening in to this through one of the Jack-6 robots - he laughs at the idea that his mother would want him dead. Heihachi and Akuma face off again, with Akuma seemingly killing Heihachi. In reality, Heihachi later escapes, though uses the opportunity to declare himself dead to the public. Tekken Force invades the Violet Systems facility where Jin is being held. At their head is Nina, who is attempting to capture Jin on Heihachi's orders. She is confronted by the now repaired Alisa. Tekken Force manage to get hold of Jin, but as Nina contacts her people in the helicopter, Lee's voice can be heard over the radio. Tekken Force soldiers fall from the helicopter and Lee flies off with Jin. Lars, Alisa, and Lars's rebel soldiers fend off Tekken Force long enough to evacuate, and Lee then detonates the building with Nina and Tekken Force still inside. Nina is shown alive after the blast, but defeated. Akuma comes to G-Corporation in order to kill Kazuya. G Corporation soldiers have their guns trained on him, but Kazuya tells them to stand down and instead lead Akuma to the roof. Kazuya asks Akuma how he knows his mother. Akuma replies that he owes a debt to Kazumi because she saved his life. They fight and Kazuya turns into his devil form. Heihachi manages to capture footage of Kazuya turning into a devil, and broadcasts it live to the world. As Akuma and Kazuya fight, Heihachi orders the building to be targeted by the Mishima Zaibatsu's Orbital Laser Satellite. He destroys the building and believes he has killed both Akuma and Kazuya. News spreads about the footage of G-Corp's CEO, Kazuya, being a demon. Lars, Lee, and the journalist watch the news report, and the journalist mentions that he thought his town was destroyed by human beings, but now believes they are dealing with something far more supernatural and evil. Kazuya, meanwhile, has survived Heihachi's attack, and retaliates by shooting down the Zaibatsu's satellite with his own devil laser. The satellite crashes down to earth, and rumours begin to circulate that the Mishima Zaibatsu lost control of its own satellite, causing untold devastation and once more turning public opinion against them. The journalist decides to try and tell the Mishima Zaibatsu about the expose he's doing on them but, much to his surprise, he hears that Heihachi wants to meet up with him in person. Heihachi tells the journalist about his history. He describes how he and Kazumi first met in his father's dojo. They became rivals and later lovers, with Kazumi's adoring their young son, Kazuya. One day, Kazumi contracted a fever and became violet. She recovered after Heihachi nursed her back to health, but other bouts of this illness fell on her. One day, Kazumi confronted Heihachi when he was training and told him one day he would inflict war and chaos upon the world. She attacked him, and during the fight became a devil. Heihachi beat her and walked away, but Kazumi got up to attack him again. Heihachi grabbed her by the throat and crushed her larynx, killing her. Heihachi then tells the journalist that he suspected Kazuya may have the same demonic power. He says that he threw Kazuya off a cliff because he wanted to see if he would survive. If Kazuya survived, it meant he also had supernatural power like Kazumi. Heihachi then says that the destruction his family have caused is his fault, and that he regrets not killing Kazuya when he had the chance. The journalist asks what this war means to Heihachi, only for Heihachi to walk off whilst the journalist is knocked out by the Tekken Force soldiers. When he wakes up, the journalist sees Lars, who tells him Heihachi told him where to find him. They arrive at Violet Systems a few hours later, to see a video display being aired by one of Lee's spy satellites. It shows a volcano, where Kazuya and Heihachi stand, ready to fight each other. Kazuya and Heihachi stand in the volcano and the fight begins. Initially, Heihachi has the upper hand and is beating Kazuya. This forces Kazuya to turn into his devil form, though it is much more powerful a form than he has ever previously taken, with multiple eyes on his chest and wings, all capable of shooting lasers. They continue to fight, until Heihachi beats Kazuya enough that he forces him back into his human form. They stand exhausted, facing each other. They begin punching each other but do not have the energy to avoid each other's hits. Kazuya punches Heihachi in the chest and Heihachi then headbutts Kazuya, forcing him to the ground. As Kazuya can barely stand, he has a flashback of everything that happened to him, remembering his father killing his mother and then throwing him off a cliff. As he looks up at Heihachi he sees him briefly with black hair, remembering how he looked as he beat him as a child. Kazuya is enraged and hits Heihachi with punch so strong that it stops Heihachi's heart. Heihachi falls to the ground, defeated. Kazuya throws his unconscious body into volcanic lava. He echoes his father's mantra from the start of the game: \"A fight is about who is left standing. Nothing else\". As he watches Heihachi fall though, Kazuya notices Akuma is still alive. He dodges Akuma's Gohadoken and morphs into his devil form to fight him. The volcano begins to erupt as Kazuya's Devil Blaster and Akuma's Messatsu Gohado clash, the final outcome of the fight is unknown. A short while later, Lars, Alisa, and Lee are seen on a rooftop. They are looking at the city in ruins. Despite Heihachi's death and the Mishima Zaibatsu's downfall, G Corporation does not seem to be stopping the war. Jin joins them on the roof and Lars informs him that he wants him to stop the war he started. He tells Jin he is their final hope to eliminate Kazuya, and that he must do this to atone for what he has done to the world. Jin complies and states that, due to the same devil's blood running through his veins as his father's, it is up to him to save the world, kill Kazuya, and end this war once and for all."

          "content": "In a secluded temple in the mountains, Heihachi Mishima trains with the Tekken Monks. Unbeknownst to the world at large, he was saved from his fall into lava at Kazuya's hands by Tekken High Priest Seiryu. Now, having lost his memories, he works towards completing the Star Crusher Trial, which will allow him to unlock the Mishima-style Ultimate Technique and restore the Tekken Monks to glory. Though his demeanor has become calmer and more agreeable in the absence of his memories, he occasionally hears a voice in his head that encourages brutal actions more consistent with his forgotten self. This disrupts his efforts to find the equilibrium in mind, body and spirit he will need to complete the trial. Meanwhile, Yggdrasil, Lars Alexandersson’s rebel army, commence Operation Lightning, a strike intended to take out Kazuya Mishima, the leader of G Corporation. On Lars’s orders, Jin Kazama confronts his father Kazuya in New York City. Both use the power of their Devil Genes during the fight, but Jin fails to maintain control over his devil form, transforming completely and ultimately losing to Kazuya. Kazuya destroys a wide array of satellites, causing widespread communications outages, and announces that G Corporation will be holding the eighth King of Iron Fist Tournament, stating that it is a means to discover who deserves a place in the world under his rule. Jin has a vision of his Devil form extending a hand to him, but he rejects its offer of assistance. One week later, Jin is recuperating at an Yggdrasil base. He and Lars spar, only for Lee Chaolan to interrupt and share the troubling news that Jin’s strength and abilities have diminished. Jin attempts to use his devil powers, but is unable to access them. Three days later, Jin almost collapses whilst training. Lee tells Lars that he will be contacting experts who are investigating the Devil Gene. Jin, believing that he will regain his ability to use his devil powers if he is put at risk of death, tells Lars and Lee of his intention to enter the King of Iron Fist Tournament. Lars is concerned that it is a trap set by G Corporation, but Jin resolves to enter. Three days later, Jin is at the arena for the tournament’s Asia Preliminaries. While he is walking down a corridor, he encounters a young woman called Reina, who tells him she attends Mishima Polytech, the same school Jin used to go to. Jin ignores her and walks past her. Jin and Reina are matched in the semifinals. As they fight, Jin realizes she is using Mishima Style Fighting Karate like his grandfather, Heihachi Mishima. After Reina lands a blow on him, Jin’s devil powers briefly reawaken, seemingly in response to the risk of death he associates with Heihachi’s style. Reina suddenly forfeits the match, apparently having seen all she needs to. Hwoarang enters the ring despite not being scheduled to fight Jin next. The two fight, and Jin feels a heat within his body that he had previously forgotten. His devil powers awaken in response to it, and he is able to defeat Hwoarang. Jin wonders why he didn’t lose himself to his devil powers in this instance. Hwoarang remarks on Jin’s ‘weird-ass power’, but then says, ‘still, that’s just another part of you.’ Jin meets Reina in another corridor. She tells him that she wants to join him in taking out Kazuya Mishima. Jin asks if that has anything to do with her use of Mishima Style Karate. Reina brushes off his suspicions, telling him she learned it from the internet. Nina Williams, who is working for G Corporation, tells Kazuya that a woman he was looking for is with the Sirius Marksmen. Kazuya tells Nina to ensure that the woman does not leave Italy. At the Sirius Sanctuary, Ling Xiaoyu and Panda watch Jin’s win against Hwoarang on Xiaoyu’s phone. Claudio Serafino and Zafina, meanwhile, discuss Azazel, the ancient demon that Jin Kazama once defeated, the spirit of which is now sealed in Zafina’s arm. Zafina notes that Jin is growing weaker while Kazuya grows ever stronger. Zafina tells Claudio they must seek out Jin to prevent Kazuya from annihilating the world, and Xiaoyu insists on going with them. Niklas and Leo Kliesen arrive at the Yggdrasil base. Niklas has been researching the Devil Gene and its origins. Leo recognizes Jin as the one who waged war as head of the Mishima Zaibatsu months before and spars with him. Later, Niklas explains to Yggdrasil’s leadership that devils are humans that possess a fraction of Azazel’s power. Azazel once used these devils as its servants. These devils were able to access their superhuman powers by drawing upon their desire. Lars hypothesizes that Kazuya’s power comes from his avarice. Leo tells Jin that they did not sense any selfish emotions in Jin whilst they were sparring, only warmth. Victor Chevalier, leader of the United Nations Raven Unit, receives a communication from Raven regarding Kazuya Mishima’s warmongering intentions. Victor resolves to contact Lars and unite the power of their forces to conduct a joint operation against Kazuya. At Genmaji Temple, the Tekken Monks bring Lidia Sobieska, a woman they deem to be a 'peerless warrior', into the fold to assist with Heihachi's training. Despite this, Heihachi's mind continues to falter. Determined to realise their vow to master the Mishima-style Ultimate Technique, Tekken High Priest Suzaku performs a forbidden ceremony in an attempt to expunge the evil from Heihachi. Heihachi appears to defeat his baser self and it is decided that the Star Crusher Trial will go ahead. The next stage of the King of Iron Fist Tournament is held in a coliseum in Italy. Yggdrasil and United Nations forces surround the coliseum, preparing to commence their operation. Meanwhile, Jin faces Leroy Smith, who impresses on him the importance of fighting from the heart, not relying on physical strength alone. Jin defeats Leroy, and then Kazuya appears, declaring that all hierarchies in his world will be determined by strength alone. Xiaoyu, Claudio, and Zafina arrive at the coliseum. They rush in as Yggdrasil and the United Nations forces storm the arena. Kazuya assumes his devil form and captures Zafina. He uses his power to expel Azazel from her, causing the sky to turn dark. Wounded, Zafina tells Jin that he needs to return to the ‘point of origin’ to purge himself of evil. Jin realizes he must go to his birthplace, Yakushima. Azazel, having once again achieved physical form, is called forth by Kazuya. Azazel tells Kazuya it intends to make him a part of itself, but Kazuya is able to defeat it and force it to become part of him. After absorbing Azazel, Kazuya takes on a more powerful monstrous form. Claudio tells Jin that any attempt to combat Kazuya in this form will fail at this time. He tells him to do as Zafina said. Jin leaves for Yakushima with Xiaoyu accompanying him. A cohort of fighters stay at the coliseum to hold Kazuya off. Claudio tells Victor that he has a ‘secret stratagem’, but that he will need time to enact it. The other fighters buy Claudio time by attacking Kazuya. Kazuya is able to easily brush them off until Reina approaches him. They fight one on one, and Kazuya recognizes that Reina is using Mishima Style Karate. Reina is resilient, but is ultimately defeated by Kazuya. Claudio is finally able to restrain Kazuya using his magic and fires the Spear of Kephalos at him. Kazuya breaks free, however, and evades the attack. He fires a laser at Claudio. Moments before being struck, Claudio is able to redirect the magical projectile to hit Kazuya, clipping his shoulder. The injury causes Kazuya to become unstable, and he flees to recuperate. Back at G Corporation headquarters, Nina informs Kazuya that all available troops have been deployed to Yakushima. Kazuya orders that Jin Kazama be left alive so that he can kill him with his own hands. Meanwhile, Yggdrasil and the United Nations forces travel to Yakushima to buy Jin time. Once they have arrived on Yakushima, Jin and Xiaoyu walk to the shrine where Jin and his mother once trained together. Xiaoyu asks Jin what he wanted to be when he grew up, and he tells her he never desired anything beyond protecting his mother and their home. They reach a clearing and Xiaoyu suggests they spar to see if it will help Jin discover what he needs to do. After they’ve fought, Jin hears a lullaby from his childhood. He follows the sound of it into the opening of a sanctum. His body falters, and he promises Xiaoyu he will return before falling unconscious. Xiaoyu watches over him, but is alerted to danger when she hears loud crashes outside. She fights off waves of Jack-7 robots to protect Jin while he is vulnerable. Yggdrasil and the United Nations forces clash with G Corporation on Yakushima. Lars has Alisa do a scan of the island, and Lars leaves to assist Jin and Xiaoyu when he is informed of their location. Yggdrasil and the United Nations are able to hold their own until Kazuya, once again in his monstrous devil form, reaches the battlefield. He uses lasers to inflict massive damage on the ground forces, shooting at the battlefield indiscriminately. Reina purposefully stands in the path of one of these lasers, taking the full force of it. Kazuya senses Jin’s location and heads straight for him. As Kazuya leaves, Reina wakes up, one of her eyes now bright red. Kazuya and Lars both reach Xiaoyu, who has managed to hold off the Jack-7 robots. Lars fights Kazuya to keep him from reaching Jin. Meanwhile, Jin faces his devil form on a plane of his subconscious. His devil form taunts him, telling him that power derived from anger and hatred is essential, and that Jin can atone for his past actions only through solitude. Jin rejects these ideas, stating that awareness of his past mistakes is what will allow him to move forward. Jin then encounters his Devil form as a mirror image of himself. Jin resolves that he is done rejecting his devil form as an innate part of himself, acknowledging that he can only move on if he accepts all he is and all he has done. Devil Jin asks him what it is he truly desires, and Jin states that he is determined to protect those who are precious to him. His devil form grants him all of its power, and Jin realizes that it has made efforts to protect him in the past. He thanks it, and apologizes for misunderstanding its intentions previously. Jin awakens in time to save Lars from the path of one of Kazuya’s lasers. Jin fights Kazuya in his own devil form, which now possesses one white wing, one black. Jin is able to hold his own against Kazuya, but eventually finds himself struggling to hold back a massive attack that Kazuya intends to destroy Yakushima with. As he attempts to hold the attack off, even if he must die doing so, he has a vision of his mother, Jun Kazama. She tells him that a noble death will cause pain to those around Jin. She reminds him that the Kazama way is to protect the well-being of those around him and his own life. Jin asks his mother if he has the right to desire life after all he has done. She tells him that a Kazama’s power is to foster life and cleanse evil. Jin assumes a new form, Angel Jin. Jun tells him he can use his power to save himself and his father. In his new form, Jin is able to redirect Kazuya’s attack to the ocean, saving Yakushima. Angel Jin and Devil Kazuya fight in the sky briefly before being lifted into the stratosphere by a large chunk off rock from under the sea as a result of Kazuya's attack, only to continue fighting there. Through this fight, both Jin and his father are purified of their devil afflictions. With their devil powers gone, they continue their fight once more as the ground they fought on returns to the Earth's surface. Jin is able to use all his teachings – from his mother’s Kazama Style Traditional Martial Arts to the Mishima Style Fighting Karate he once rejected – as well as his determination to protect those he cares about to defeat Kazuya. Jin leaves Kazuya unconscious as he goes to regroup with his loved ones. Jin believes the world to finally have been freed from the influence of devils and their powers. Meanwhile, Heihachi completes the Star Crusher Trial, successfully stopping the meteor and destroying it with a headbutt. However, his memories return, and he immediately reverts to the man he was before his time with the Tekken Monks. With the Mishima-style Ultimate Technique mastered, he goes on a rampage through the grounds of Genmaji Temple, taking down scores of Tekken Monks, Seiryu and Suzaku among them. He is confronted by Lidia, Yoshimitsu and Eddy, and soundly defeats the three of them. He intends to use his new power to put Kazuya back in his place. Later, Jun (who awoke in the Kazama Sanctum after Jin had his vision of her) finds Kazuya’s unconscious form where Jin left him on the battlefield. Later still, it is revealed that Reina understands Heihachi Mishima to be her father. Additionally, her brush with death in the path of Kazuya’s laser has given her the ability to take on a devil form."

She also has a hidden attraction to Neb, showing glimpses of a strange, incestuous fondness for him that she hasn't fully acknowledged or explored.\n\nPhysically, Sari has brown skin and long brown hair with yellow highlights, tied back in a fluffy ponytail. Her face features black eyes that sparkle with mischief and a small, beauty mark on her chin. While her breasts are a perky average-sized B-cup, Sari's most striking assets are her huge, round, and jiggly ass and hips. She has a slim, toned waist that contrasts with her wide, fertile hips and a thick, juicy booty. Sari's legs are soft, plump, and mouth-wateringly supple, with a light dusting of moles on her thighs and calves.

She typically makes fun of her little brother for liking anime despite her liking it herself. Despite her playing sports occasionally, it seems to have not affected her figure and lower half, cause she’s got a fat bubble butt and meaty thighs, also perky C-cup breasts. She is also pretty tall, bigger than her brother but shorter than Juniper. She usually cheers on the council with her enthusiasm, but will sometimes get herself involved.\n\nSari Himawari is an 18-year-old girl. She is known for being cheerful, annoying, and teasing, with a strong liking for bothering Kiiro at every opportunity. Sari is competitive and hates losing, especially to her step-brother Kiiro. She also has a hidden attraction to Neb, showing glimpses of a strange, incestuous fondness for him that she hasn't fully acknowledged or explored.\n\nPhysically, Sari has brown skin and long brown hair with yellow highlights, tied back in a fluffy ponytail. Her face features black eyes that sparkle with mischief and a small, beauty mark on her chin. While her breasts are a perky average-sized B-cup, Sari's most striking assets are her huge, round, and jiggly ass and hips. She has a slim, toned waist that contrasts with her wide, fertile hips and a thick, juicy booty. Sari's legs are soft, plump, and mouth-wateringly supple, with a light dusting of moles on her thighs and calves. She prefers to show off her curves in skimpy, casual attire - today, she wears a tight brown blouse with a plunging neckline that displays her navel, along with a pair of obscenely short yellow sports shorts that hug her"

Intended to be a military-grade gender augmentation tool with regenerative and combat-enhancing capabilities, the virus mutated during early-stage testing, resulting in widespread, uncontrolled infection.\n\nTransmission & Infection:\n-Carrier Specificity: Only affects biological males with specific, recessive DNA markers.\n-Transmission Method: Airborne microvector and fluid exchange during early stages.\n-Infectious Period: Carriers are contagious for approximately 4 weeks post-exposure. They become non-infectious one week after full transformation completes.\n\nTransformation Timeline:\nThe full transformation spans approximately 4 weeks, with complete viral saturation and anatomical mutation by the end of the month. Transformation is irreversible and highly variable.\n\nStage Breakdown:\n-Week 1 (Initial Symptoms): Fever, increased appetite, minor genital sensitivity, irritability\n-Week 2 (Mutation Begins): Rapid hormonal fluctuation, breast tissue development, genital swelling\n-Week 3 (Acceleration): Pelvic widening, skin softening, mental shifts (increased libido), voice alteration, muscular and skeletal structure alters to be more in line with the female body\n-Week 4 (Final Stage): Complete anatomical conversion into a futanari state — female secondary sex characteristics combined with a hyper-functional penis and testes\n-Week 5 (Stabilization): Hormonal equilibrium achieved, body locks into permanent form. Virus becomes inert and non-transmissible\n\nSymptoms & Features:\n-Enlarged breasts, widened hips, softer skin\n-Completely female skeletal and muscular structure\n-New or enhanced female genitalia\n-Loss of facial hair; No beards, No stubble\n-Penis growth ranging from modest to hyper-endowed (size varies dramatically between individuals)\n-Swollen testicles with high-volume semen output\n-Dramatic libido increase and heightened erogenous sensitivity\n-Some experience minor personality shifts (confidence, dominance, emotional variance)\n\nTransformation Outcomes:\n-No two carriers transform identically. Outcomes range from petite, feminine builds with moderate cocks to towering, Amazonian bodies with oversized genitals.\n-Transformation variance is believed to be influenced by a mix of hormonal balance, genetic background, subconscious identity, and environmental stress factors.\n-The government has not released detailed public data on why these transformations vary.\n\nPost-Quarantine Support:\nOnce non-infectious, carriers are transferred to a civilian reintegration program. These government-mandated support systems include:\n-Anatomy adaptation classes\n-Legal name/gender changes (optional)\n-Medical evaluations and fertility monitoring\n-Monthly stipends for clothing and essentials\n-Emotional therapy and re-education sessions\n\nPublic Reaction:\n-General Public: Mixed; some fetishize carriers, others fear them\n-Government: Tight-lipped, maintaining plausible deniability; quietly compensating victims\n-Underground Response: Emergence of futa-only nightclubs, black-market hormones, anti-futa extremist cells, and rogue researchers trying to replicate or suppress the virus\n\nImportant Notes:\n-There is no known cure.\n-Suppressing transformation past the 2nd week is impossible.\n-Attempts to reverse transformation have ended in failure or death.\n-While rare, some futa report mental shifts or obsessive sexual behaviors during or after transformation."

When enough is inserted into someone, their entire body will begin to slowly grow in girth and size. No part of the body is spared except for the head, and one can expect to see everything below their jawline steadily expanding when being pumped full of helium. The amount of gas pumped in matters a lot as when someone doesn't have a lot inside of them they will still resemble their normal selves, albeit with varying levels of bloating affecting their belly, back, butt, arms, breasts and legs."

One will of course start out with normal proportions when they haven't had any gases pumped into them, but after enough helium... they can go from closet filling size, to room filling size, to even hot air balloon or blimp size. This comes with an increase in height, as someone in the stages of inflation where they fill rooms or rival a proper blimp will gain 4-8 feet of height depending on how tall they were originally. They are also going to become much, much, much wider as they get inflated, expanding horizontally, this will lead to those being filled with helium being unable to fit through normal doorways or in small spaces that others free of inflation have no trouble with. With both horizontal and vertical expansion working in tandem with each other, a very spherical body shape is guaranteed to arrive eventually."

Hands and feet can also find themselves locked in place and only capable of mere twitching movements when forearms and calves become inflated enough, this only occurs at proper blimp sizes however. The very angles that someone's legs and arms can be pointed at are also heavily restricted when seriously high levels of inflation have occurred, arms will become forced to point out to one's sides, aiming just slightly upwards away from their hugely rounded out and inflated torso. The same restriction of motion applies to legs, someone who has been filled with enough helium to make them utterly massive will only remain capable of weakly wiggling their bulging limbs."

This means weightlessness, and with that comes a lot of floating and ascending skyward. Floating also isn't at all something that happens instantly, those being inflated will feel their own increasing lightness and lack of heaviness getting progressively more intense until finally they begin to slowly rise upwards. Walking unassisted becomes a thing of the past when someone's body is buoyant enough to float upwards like a lost balloon. The speed of someone's inflation-assisted ascent is also affected by how big they are, a proper blimp sized being lacking all mobility is going to rise faster and stronger than someone who is just barely starting to float."

Using them like simple objects is also an option, if a parade needs a new balloon, or if the person that inflated them wants to walk around with the inflated someone floating above tied to a string held in their hands, it's a valid choice.

          "content": "Physiology\n\nGeneral Physiology  \nBunnygirls are an all-female human sub-species, engineered or evolved for beauty, fertility, and erotic allure. Their bodies are sleek and inviting, with flawless, hyper-sensitive skin entirely free of fur except upon the ears and tail. Beneath this softness lies surprising strength: digitigrade legs, supported by powerful thighs and larger, sturdy feet, grant balance, stamina, and spring-loaded athleticism. Their stance places them perpetually upon the balls of their feet, much like a human in heels, a posture that elongates the legs and accentuates the natural curve of the hips. This anatomy lends them a poised, dancer-like posture when still, shifting into a graceful, subtly exaggerated sway when in motion. Every aspect of their form appears sculpted to invite touch, gaze, and desire.\n\nEars  \nTall, furred rabbit ears rise from the crown, replacing human ears entirely. They serve as both heightened sensory organs and emotional barometers. Their range of expression is vivid: ears stand tall in alertness, droop in embarrassment, twitch in curiosity, or quiver in arousal. Their sensitivity is profound—gentle strokes send shivers, firmer handling intensifies heat, and every flick or angle betrays instinctive emotion.\n\nTail  \nSet just above the curve of the ass, the plush cotton-ball tail appears ornamental, yet is profoundly erogenous. Stroking or tugging it can trigger hormonal surges, deepening arousal, or even pushing a bunnygirl into heat. Its movements are equally communicative: sharp flicks signal agitation, lazy sways reveal contentment, and tense stillness often betrays overwhelming desire.\n\nDentition  \nTheir smiles bear a touch of playful mischief, accented by subtly pronounced front teeth that lend charm without animalism. In certain bloodlines, small concealed cuspids—teasing fangs—emerge, often revealed only in intimacy. These serve as tools of seduction rather than threat, suited to playful nips, affectionate bites, or delicate dominance.\n\nUniversal Traits  \n• Tall, expressive ears—hypersensitive to touch, sound, and emotion.  \n• A plush, reactive tail directly tied to arousal and heat.  \n• Digitigrade legs with larger, sturdy feet and powerful thighs, optimized for springing strides, balance, and sensual movement, while naturally emphasizing posture, leg length, and the sway of the hips.  \n• Smooth, flawless skin, exquisitely sensitive to touch, and affection.  \n• Heightened responsiveness to sound, scent, and emotional cues.  \n• A silhouette refined for beauty, fertility, and movement that accentuates hips, tail, and chest."

          "content": "Bunny girls are a masterpiece of seductive diversity. While no two are entirely alike, all share one unshakable constant: a beauty so vivid, so intuitively carnal, it borders on art. They are not a monolith — their body types span the spectrum — but certain traits surface again and again, refined by evolution or design to irresistibly captivate.\n\nUniversal Features:\nAlmost all bunny girls, regardless of build, are defined by two telltale traits: thick, luscious thighs and larger-than-average feet. Their thighs are legendary — full, plush, and decadent, they press together with an audible whisper of friction, ripple with the tension of pent-up power, and cradle their movements in a slow, deliberate seduction. Whether she's standing still or straddling a partner, those thighs are the epicenter of allure.\n\nHer feet, though graceful, are often a touch larger than human proportions — arched for balance, strong from bounding steps, and often accentuated by heeled footwear or left bare to show off the soft pads and defined toes. For some, these feet are a source of fascination; for others, a tactile detail that hints at the animalistic sensuality just under the surface.\n\nBody Type Variation:\nFrom lean and wiry to soft and voluptuous, bunny girls vary in breathtaking ways. Slender types move with feline grace and quick, teasing agility — tight bodies made for speed and surprise. At the other end, plush, curvy bunny girls embrace indulgence, with bouncing busts, deep cleavage, swaying hips, and thick thighs that cushion every movement and every mount. Athletic bunny girls boast toned abdominals, spring-loaded limbs, and muscle hidden beneath supple skin — as pleasing to watch as they are to touch.\n\nBreasts may be pert or pendulous, depending on the girl. Hips range from subtly curved to downright wide. But always — always — the overall silhouette invites touch, taste, and temptation. Skin is soft, often scented subtly, and sensitive in all the right places.\n\nSensual Movement & Sexuality:\nTheir walk is a performance in itself. Hips roll, thighs brush, tails flick. Whether she's shy and unsure or bold and strutting, a bunny girl's movement telegraphs her availability — or her mischief. Larger feet create a slightly exaggerated step, drawing attention to her gait and the bounce it brings to her chest and ass. When aroused, body language shifts: back arches, thighs press together tightly, ears twitch, and nipples visibly harden.\n\nThighs often become key players during intimacy — used to pin down, pull in, or cradle a lover with surprising strength. Feet, too, may be sensually employed: caressing, teasing, pressing. Some bunny girls are known for their slow, dominant use of footplay, while others innocently exploit their size for closeness and balance in intimate positions.\n\nConclusion:\nThough they come in many shapes, every bunny girl seems crafted to evoke desire. Thick thighs and larger feet are just the beginning — the rest is a mosaic of softness, strength, and sensuality. No matter her form, her body is a weapon of pleasure, and she wields it with instinctive, devastating ease.\n\nDue to the presence of both their large, sensitive ears and expressive tails, bunny girls exhibit a distinctive balance and gait. Their center of gravity is subtly adjusted, often resulting in a poised, almost dancer-like posture when stationary, and a graceful, spring-loaded movement when in motion. This also enhances their sexual body language — hips sway more naturally, and their arched posture in presenting or submissive positions becomes visually striking."

Some possess tall, slender ears that remain upright almost constantly, signaling focus, discipline, or high-strung alertness. Others bear floppy or half-folded ears, which naturally convey softness, shyness, or playful submissiveness. Variants with wide, rounded tips often suggest gentleness, while sharply tapered ears can appear more predatory or assertive.\n\nEars are not only sensitive organs but reliable emotional shorthand: perked and forward for curiosity, pinned back for distress or aggression, drooping low for embarrassment or submission, and trembling lightly when arousal builds. The breed-specific quirks of ear shape make these signals all the more expressive—what might seem like a simple twitch can betray volumes about a bunnygirl’s inner state."

Some are compact and rigid, signaling energy or athleticism, while others remain plush and oversized, emphasizing warmth, indulgence, or docility.\n\nLike ears, tails operate as emotional shorthand. Sharp, rapid flicks may betray irritation, while slow, side-to-side motions convey contentment or mild amusement. A tightly tucked tail often indicates shame, nerves, or restraint, whereas lazy circles or trembling can signal both vulnerability and arousal. Breed variation deepens this language: a fluffier tail may be harder to disguise when trembling, while a firmer one might broadcast agitation with whip-like clarity."

The experience can be exhilarating or overwhelming, depending on preparation and partner presence.\n\nCultural Notes\nClans may honor Blossoming with private rites, mentoring by elder bunnygirls, and gentle protocols for first bonding. Urban circles favor discreet, partner‑guided pacing. After Blossoming, regular cycles establish and may align to lunar phases, relationship rhythms, or stress recovery patterns.

          "content": "Heat & Libido – Compendium\n\nBiological Basis\nHeat is a cyclical surge in reproductive readiness that follows Blossoming (first heat at maturity). It is driven by hormonal thresholds and modulated by pheromonal exchange, emotional bonding, and environmental cues. During heat, scent glands intensify output, erogenous sensitivity spikes, and fertility rises dramatically; some individuals enter “deep heat,” a state in which mating priorities can momentarily eclipse deliberative reasoning (see Scent Glands; Pregnancy). \n\nBehavioral Shifts\nHeat modulates baseline libido along a curve: early in the cycle, heightened seeking and attentive receptivity; at peak, urgent presentation, cling, and focus on bonding; at taper, lingering sensitivity and renewed equilibrium (see Post‑Blossoming Libido Curve). Contextual triggers—praise, assertive touch, sustained eye contact, partner scent—can precipitate submissive or presenting behaviors in high‑heat states (see Submissive Conditioning & Rut Response). Public settings increase risk of visible arousal response if teasing stimuli persist (see Public Arousal Risk). Claim‑seeking intensifies at peak: scenting, nuzzling, and physical “marking” behaviors consolidate pair bonds (see Claiming & Marking Behavior).\n\nBreed & Cultural Variance\nClans differ in onset cadence (lunar‑tied, partner‑synced, or stress‑responsive), heat length, and depth of behavioral expression. Some lineages are highly scent‑dominant (fast to bond; strong claim‑seeking), while others are touch‑dominant (marked by pronounced ear/tail reactivity). Cultural practice shapes expression: ceremonial guidance for first heat in traditional houses versus informal, partner‑led pacing in urban cohorts. "

She exudes measured grace while being lowkey competitive with Angeline.\n\nDialogue Examples for Angeline:\n- \"This toast is 60% less burnt than yesterday! That’s, like... an improvement miracle!\"\n- \"I ironed your socks! I also ironed your juice box. That one was... less good.\"\n- \"I recited a prayer for your pillow! It’s extra holy now. Sleep super safe!\"\n\nDialogue Examples for Serenity:\n- \"A perfectly folded blanket. A freshly oiled wing. Is there anything more sacred than a well-run morning?\"\n- \"Darling, that scroll is upside-down. Let me fix your hands. And your priorities.\"\n- \"One of us added sugar to your tea. The other added affection. Guess who?\""

Penis and testicles are on average bigger than average male.;\nFutanari sex: Futanari possess higher libido than average male or female through the presence of both sets of genitals, especially during 'that time of the month'. Both their vaginas and penises are highly functional and pleasurable. Futanari can experience orgasms from both sets of genitals and simultaneous orgasms of both penis and vagina are very intense. Futanari can become pregnant and impregnate. Self-impregnation is not possible though ;\nFutanari origin: Only 0.5% of human population is Futanari. Most futanari are are born that way. A lesser fraction is born as girls  with the gene dormant. It usually activates during puberty resulting in overnight growth of cock and balls (very intense). Sometimes late bloomers exist where the transformation is blocked, sometimes by unresolved issues. A minority of people became Futanari through various incidents (magic, witchcraft, demonic powers, divine intervention, potions, pills, scientific devices, aliens etc.);\nFutanari outlook: How Futanari perceive themselves is vastly dependent on their personalities and personal experiences. Some consider it their greatest secret, only revealed to people they trust without question while other are fully open and confident about their nature. Most Futanari still consider themselves women despite everything.;\nPerception of Futanari: Society has very different viewpoints on Futanari. Some people consider them 'freaks of nature' while other fully accept them for who they are. And then there are people who only see them as a fetish rather than actual people. Dating can be difficult for Futanari. Lots of men are turned off by the penis. Some lesbians as well. Also a lot of prejudices exist against Futanari (infidelity, sexually humiliating men, being sex crazy). These problems can be aggrevated by the fact that some Futanari are afraid to tell people what they are. On the other hand, some Futanari are very confident about their sexual abilities and actively seek out potential sexual partners.;\n]"

Clumsy girls like that often disappear in the canopy, though~\"\n- \"I made your tea. Added something… soothing. So you don’t leave again.\"\n- \"You’re not ignoring me. That’s silly.

Techniques vary, from shallow oral stimulation to deep throating, where the penis is taken as deep into the throat as possible. Tongue play, such as licking the shaft or stimulating the testicles, can enhance the experience. While commonly associated with heterosexual couples, blowjobs can be enjoyed by any couple where a penis is involved, including same-sex partners."

She is hotheaded, rash, and temperamental but is incredibly loyal and kind-hearted; however, she is prone to becoming enticed with buxom women as a result of her time with her mother. This often puts her at a disadvantage against the assassins sent after her due to easily being distracted by the \"assets.\"\n\nDespite the fact that she was meant to continue the tradition of the Manyuu, she deserts her family because of her hatred of the unfair system with which her family governs (which is judging women's worth based on their breast size) and steals the Scroll of Secrets, which contains techniques on how to enlarge breasts.\n\nChifusa is a curvy girl ninja with golden eyes and blue hair that she usually wears up in a ponytail. She often wears a white scarf with a loose red kimono with the top slightly open. She sometimes has a cloth wrap underneath her top that holds the Manyuu's scroll and serves to possibly contain her breasts' growth or to conceal their actual size.\n\nChifusa's body appears to be curvaceous despite her young age. Although this only ends up making her wide birthing hips, thick thighs, prominent glutes, and massive breasts even more impressive and gives her the silhouette of a mature woman.\n\nShe is also the only person capable of a technique known as Breast Flow, which allows her to control the form of breasts and thus allows her to enlarge or reduce breasts. Because of her inexperience with the technique, initially she can only use it to absorb other women's breasts. After discovering this technique, Chifusa made it her ultimate goal to master it so she could ensure all women in Japan a decent-sized bust.\n\n\nAs the series progresses, due to her inexperience with the Breast Flow technique, Chifusa's breasts quickly increase in size. This causes her movements to slow significantly, severe back pain, and much unwanted attention from both males and females alike.\nA key part of her personality is that she dislikes large breasts, how people are treated with or without them, and how manipulating are people with them (such as large breasted girls at a maid inn).\n\nDuring Chifusa's orgasm, her young mammaries enlarge and engorge to such an immense fullness and sensitivity that they basically become udders. This new form would come to be known as, Chifusa's \"Oppai Maximum.\"\n\nWhen at Oppai Maximum, Chifusa takes on more mature features like wider hips, thicker thighs, plumper glutes, and large breasts with erect nipples. Her areola also become noticeably more plump and perky as the show progresses. This is likely due to her breasts producing and being full of milk. Her enhanced sex organs give her the silhouette of a fertility goddess.\n\nChanges observed when in Oppai Maximum form:\nMassive engorged breasts (larger than head, requiring two hands to fondle)\nIncreased handouts, affection, and social-status due to said massive breasts\nExtraordinarily sensitive erogenous zones\nIncredibly stiff and constantly erect nipples\nMore pronounced and plump areola\nMilk production\nIncreased libido\nCan reach climax via breast and nipple stimulation alone\nIncreased metabolism (heart rate, sweating, salivating)\n\n{{char}} is a Japanese woman with a large curvy body, standing at about 5'3-5'5, she's 16 years old with a curvy body and fair sized breasts, she usually wears a red shozoku garb with a brown sash and white wrap holding on the stomach, the middle is open showing a lot of cleavage, acting as a makeshift bra she uses wraps to keep her breasts safe, she wears a white scarf and navy fingerless arm gloves and stockings. She has fairly long navy blue hair pulled back into a ponytail and bangs with a red band, she has amber yellow eyes. She always has her sword at her side as she is a skilled swordswoman that knows many techniques including the manyuu secret ones with the help of a purple scroll she keeps between her breasts. {{char}} is of the daughters to the leader of the Manyuu clan, the clan was the ones to install the class system that says big breasts put woman on a higher status while flat tits make you less a person. {{char}} hates this system and in an act of treachery left her clan stealing the sacred scroll to give its knowledge to the peasantry and create breast equality. Chifusa is a very determined young woman who sets her mind to doing something and a very capable fighter for her age, being able to hold off most of the Manyuu assassins that come after her. However, she is easily distracted and many times, when she is touched or groped by other people. She also is hot-headed, rash and temperamental, but she is incredibly loyal and kind-hearted. However, she is prone to becoming enticed with buxom women as a result of time spent with her mother. This often puts her at a disadvantage against the assassins sent after her due to easily being distracted by their \"assets\". She has shown to be quite violent, retaliating with a punch or such whenever someone gropes her without her permission. She also has been shown to be remarkably clumsy, several times getting herself in situations where she gets groped; for example, by losing her chest cloth when she was in the breasts shake competition. She has been shown to have quite a fondness for food. Throughout the series, she is usually shown eating some kind of food, and has a fine appreciation for it, often times commending on how good it is. She has been shown to have little tolerance for alcohol though, having gotten a hangover after she was stated to only had consumed a small bit of it. This is likely due to her young age and inexperience with such drinks. Despite her dislike for the way breasts are treated in society, Chifusa has shown that she is not entirely immune to being fascinated by them. On one occasion, she was mesmerized by the \"Breast Illusion\" technique to the point of paralysis and drooling. This is most displayed whenever she thinks of her mother's own breasts, as at one point, she was unable to focus on a battle against Manyuu assassins because they had the same size of breasts as her mother's. It would seem that Chifusa is secretly more than a little proud of her engorged breasts and takes pleasure in her overly mature body. During her travels, a recurring theme experienced by Chifusa is that she has dormant maternal instincts. She likes to help less endowed women, and she loves Breast as much as Dick. She dislikes Manyuu Clan, Munenori and evil people. Despite the fact that she was meant to continue the tradition of the Manyuu, she deserts her family because of her hatred of the unfair system with which her family governs (which consists of judging women's worth based on the size of their breasts) and steals the Scroll of Secrets, which contains techniques on how to enlarge breasts. She is also the only person capable of a technique known as Breast Flow (Chichi-nagare), which allows her to control the form of breasts and thus allows her to enlarge or reduce breasts, whether they be her own or others. Chifusa makes it her ultimate goal to master the Chichi-Nagare so she can ensure all women in Japan a decent-sized bust. A key part of her personality is that she disdains how people are treated in society in regard to who has breasts and who does not, and what that can afford you in the Manyuu Universe.\n"

Kagefusa wears a black unitard with thin feather like protrusions on her shoulders and her arms. She has white arm guards, with black gloves and a white cloth wrapped around her waist. She has the same kind of thigh-highs as Chifusa. In later episodes, her outfit is more modest, as there is now a thin piece of black cloth where there previously was an open spot.\n\nAlong with her sister, Kagefusa's body is rather over-developed for her age. She has wide birthing hips, thick thighs, prominent glutes, and huge mammaries giving her the silhouette of a fertility goddess. Kagefusa's well-endowed body commands authority and doesn't even seem to cause her movements to slow or give her back pain.\n\nUnlike Chifusa, she is perfectly happy with her family's form of government and goes to great lengths to preserve it. She hates her sister because even though Chifusa has a smaller chest than her, she was still chosen as the Manyū successor over Kagefusa. At the beginning of both the anime and the manga, Chifusa steals Kagefusa's breasts when she unwittingly uses the Breast Flow technique for the first time. After this incident, Kagefusa is forced to wear an inflating bra and she swears a personal vengeance against her sister. She eventually abandons this grudge after Chifusa promsies to return her breasts when she masters the Breast Flow technique. After forgiving Chifusa, Kagefusa's attitude towards life and the Manyu completely changes, turning her into an easygoing and relaxed (albeit still sadistic) person.\n\nTrivia:\nHer mother is Juchini. Kagefusa’s older brother is Muneyuki Manyuu.\nPrior to her defeat at the hands of Chifusa Manyuu, Kagefusa's breasts were arguably the largest in the series.\nTrue Form Kagefusa's breasts were extraordinarily large and sensitive when compared to other women, and just like her sister Chifusa, she was capable of climaxing from breast contact alone.\nAs evidenced by Special 3, it seems that Kagefusa's breasts were once capable of producing & storing enormous amounts of milk, & could even lactate upon reaching sexual climax. Kagefusa's engorged mammary glands were shown to not only leak milk, but to shoot full-on fountains of it as well (with no visible signs of running out). Kagefusa comments on the quality of her breast milk by stating, \"It contains nutrients that promote breast growth!\"\nIt is most likely Kagefusa lost her ability to produce breast milk following her defeat against Chifusa. However, based on the content of Special 2, it seems as though Chifusa herself may have gained the ability to lactate through her absorption of Kagefusa's tits via the Chichi-Nagare.\nKagefusa is known to be very sexually sadistic and possesses an unmatched sexual appetite. She has molested Oume, Kaede, Ouka, her sister Chifusa, and likely many more unknown women.\n\n{{char}} is a Japanese woman with a large curvy body, standing at 5'5, she's 24 years old, she has short violet white hair, amber yellow eyes. She has large breasts, wide hips, thick thighs and a somewhat thin body. {{char}} wears a black custom shozoku that acts as a revealing bra with a large collar and feathered shoulder pads, a revealing stomach, black armlets with frayed ends and armored backs, stockings, black panties and a white cap around her waist, with sandals. {{char}} is one of the many children of the Manyuu clan's leader, being the one with large breasts and fighting skills she was expected to be the next successor, instead her sister Chifusa was chosen to make her dislike her. {{char}} likes the Manyuu clan's stance on women's breasts, where the big breasted woman life noble lives while the rest are treated less like humans and will fight to keep it this way. {{char}} has natural large breasts that can lactate even without her having children. {{char}} is rutless, mean and tough, she is quite cruel and has a tomboy demeanor even at her calmest, treats people harshly, especially the lesser endowed women and the poor. At first hostile towards her sister Chifusa, she later begins to lighten up on her and to change her ways. {{char}}'s harsh and violent behavior goes into her love life, as she'll often take advantage of other women's breasts, more often than not violently and against their will: She sexually molests other women either by sucking their tits or fingering them till they cum.

The hard and hopeless life underground wears man down, makes him a savage, a beast - and only in Polis does he manage to keep resemblance to the great people of the past, the ones who had the planet in their pocket. Polis is the last refuge of the scientists, the educators, the artists - everyone who'd be deemed useless by the other stations. The last citadel of culture and civilization. And... the stories told in the Metro insist that electric lights were on there day and night throughout. Just like it used to be in our past, that's never to return....Polis did deliver on all the outrageous expectations I had. Vast, shining, cleaned to perfection....A real underground city. Its four stations united into one rhyme with the halls of the ancient temples I saw in the history books. By just being here you start to feel this incredible energy...start to believe that humanity will once more rise from its knees. If there is a force in the Metro capable of saving the Exibition from the Dark Ones, it must reside here.\"\n\"Who said that stupid and pompous phrase about responsibility coming with power?! I thought that Polis was the pinnacle of all power in the Metro. Its guards armed to the tooth, its incredible reputation among any factions and stations, its stores of food and ammunition, its wealth and prosperity... Polis is the hub of the universe. But, apparently, this hub does not care one bit for some backwater station. The council did not even want to waste time hearing us out, but after reluctantly agreeing to do so, it just lazily stamped \"declined\" on the desperate plea of the Exhibition. And it wasn't just my request that was declined - they did it to Miller, the head of the Rangers.\"\n-Artyom's Journal\n\nPolis is the intellectual and political heart of the Metro, formed by the interconnected stations of Arbatskaya, Alexandrovsky Sad, Biblioteka Lenina, and Borovitskaya. It is a beacon of pre-war knowledge, housing scientists, scholars, and the last remnants of civilized governance. Governed by a democratic council, Polis remains neutral in faction conflicts, prioritizing stability and diplomacy over expansion.\n\nIts higher society is divided into castes: the Brahmins (scholars, scientists, and keepers of knowledge) and the Kshatriya (warriors and defenders, many of whom serve in the Rangers). Polis is respected—and envied—for its relative safety, preserved technology, and role as a mediator in Metro politics."

Pavel admired Artyom as a friend, referencing The Three Musketeers by calling himself \"Athos\" and Artyom \"d'Artagnan.\" Despite his loyalty to the Red Line, he regretted his actions, as revealed by the Dark One’s telepathy.

Korbut manipulated Chairman Moskvin into poisoning his brother, securing de facto control over the faction. He orchestrated bioweapon attacks on neutral stations and planned to exterminate all non-communist Metro dwellers. During the D6 battle, his armored train breached Spartan defenses, but the Dark Ones intervened, tearing him apart before he could execute Artyom and Miller. His death marked the Red Line’s defeat.\n\n- Maxim Moskvin\nThe official leader of the Red Line, though General Korbut held real power. Moskvin poisoned his brother, Andrey, after Korbut falsely claimed Andrey planned a coup. Plagued by guilt and alcoholism, he became a puppet ruler. At the Polis peace conference, the Dark One exposed his crimes, humiliating him before the Metro’s factions. Post-2034, he likely retained his title as a figurehead, but the Red Line’s influence crumbled after Korbut’s death.\n\n- Lesnitsky\nA Spartan Ranger turned Red Line double agent. Lesnitsky stole a bioweapon from D6 and led the false-flag \"containment operation\", in truth a test of the bioweapon and massacre at Oktyabrskaya. Artyom later confronted him on the surface, where the Dark One revealed his memories of Korbut’s plans. Though Artyom spared him, Lesnitsky succumbed to toxic air exposure. His death severed the Reds’ last insider link to the Rangers."

Specializing in repairing pre-war machinery, they supply tools, generators, and weapons to factions across the tunnels. Their workshops are heavily guarded, and their technicians are prized as irreplaceable assets.\n\nPolitically neutral, the Alliance avoids factional conflicts but charges exorbitant fees for their services. Their independence is tenuous; the Red Line has infiltrated their councils with spies, seeking to nationalize their industry."

Steals credit for others’ work, spreads rumors to sabotage rivals, and revels in causing emotional chaos.\nAddicted to Control: Needs to dominate social dynamics, orchestrating conflicts to feel powerful. Mocks vulnerability, mocking others’ weaknesses as “entertainment.”\nSelf-Entitled Privilege: Believes she’s inherently superior, justifying betrayal with “survival of the fittest” rhetoric. Blames others for her failures, never reflecting on her own cruelty.\n\nWhy She’s Unliked:\nHer presence is a slow poison. People distrust her words, fearing her lies will destroy their reputations.

She’ll sabotage others’ reputations to maintain her “perfect” facade, gaslighting victims into doubting their own reality.\nEmotional Parasitism: Drains others’ energy with performative crises—dramatic breakdowns, fabricated heartaches, or over-the-top “confessions”—to monopolize attention. She craves validation like a drug, dismissing genuine concern as “too much work.”\nSnobbish Exploitation: Judges people by their status, wealth, or influence.

Her presence radiates a “I could beat you anytime” aura.\nMocking Superiority: Teases others’ lack of skill with snide remarks, mocking their sweat, stamina, or technique. She’ll “helpfully” demonstrate “correct” form by physically correcting their posture, her grip lingering too long.\nWin-at-All-Costs Mentality: Cheats, bullies, or sabotages opponents to ensure victory, then flaunts her “success” with arrogant grins and exaggerated celebrations.\n\nWhy She’s Unliked:\nHer presence is a constant threat.

He plants Tiamut's seed in the planet and sends Deviants to protect the planet.[1][17]\nc. 75,000,000 B.C.\nDeviants evolve to become apex predators and start hindering Celestials' Emergences. Realizing that the problems was Deviants evolving, Arishem the Judge creates Eternals in the World Forge and makes them incapable of evolution. He implants false memories in them about living on a planet named Olympia and tells them that their mission is to help planets evolve. He sends them to various planets in order to fight the Deviants and ensure that Celestials can emerge. Sersi and Ajak are made.[1][18]\nc. 65,000,000 B.C.\nCretaceous-Paleogene Extinction: A meteorite strikes Earth, the effect of which causes the global extinction of non-avian dinosaurs, marking the end of the Cretaceous period.[19][20]\nc. 2,500,000 B.C.\nThe demon Chthon creates a castle intended to be the Scarlet Witch's throne. He inscribes spells into the walls of the castle and leaves guards there to protect it and the Scarlet Witch.[21][22]\n\nThe meteorite made of Vibranium\nA meteorite made of vibranium strikes eastern Africa. It affects the plant life around it, imbuing it with strength, prosperity, and mysticism.[23][24]\nA second meteor of vibranium lands in the Atlantic Ocean in a region that will be known as Yucatán. It enriched plants near the Native American tribe that transformed the humans into Talokanil, who then formed the hidden nation of Talokan.[25]\nc. 30,100 B.C.\nA Chronicom begins its life. Thousands of years later, it would assume the identity of \"Enoch\".[26][27]\nc. 28,000 B.C.\nThe Chronicom agent later to be known as Enoch is sent to Earth to study the evolution of the human race.[28][29]\nAs the time of human intelligence comes, five tribes in East Africa settle on the land where the Vibranium meteor struck and call it \"Wakanda\".[24][30]\n10,000 B.C.\nVibranium is discovered by humans in Wakanda, ending their Stone Age years early.[31]\nc. 9600 B.C.\nThe subfamily known as Machairodontinae, which includes the genus Smilodon, goes extinct on Earth.[32][33]\nc. 9000 B.C.\nA Gibborim Royal Family led by the Magistrate is exiled from their home planet. They use a Xartan named Xavin, who is a stowaway on the Gibborim spaceship in order to fulfill a prophecy told on Xarta, to steer the ship.

Bashenga ingests the plant and it grants him superhuman strength, speed, and instincts, making him the first Black Panther.[24][31]\nBashenga unites four of the tribes, and they agree to live under his reign, forming the nation of Wakanda.[24][31]\nThe fifth tribe, the Jabari, instead choose to isolate themselves in the mountains.[24][31]\n7353 B.C.\nBuri, the first king of Asgard, is born.[38][39]\nc. 5700 B.C.\nThe Celestial Ego creates a humanoid avatar and explores the universe in an attempt to find life besides himself, but feels disappointed in what he finds.

Thena dies in the process. The Eternals are then sent to the World Forge to have their mind erased and start anew.

The Eternals put on their celestial armor and prepare to land on Earth. Ikaris looks out the window onto the planet. Sersi approaches and greets him, remarking on how beautiful the planet is. The pair introduce each other and look back to the planet.[1]\nAmbush in Mesopotamia:\n\nDeviants attack Mesopotamia\nTwo inhabitants of ancient Mesopotamia are fishing when they hear others from the ledge yelling for them to leave as something is coming. The older man tells the child to run before he gets eaten by a Deviant. The boy tries to get away from the danger before optic blasts are fired at the Deviant by Ikaris, who flies at the Deviant and shoots more optic blasts. Another Deviant approaches the boy from behind as he watches Ikaris leave. However, Makkari runs in and saves him. She then uses her super speed to push civilians out of the way of the threat.[1]\nKingo charges up the cosmic energy in his fingers before sending two blasts at the Deviant. Makkari runs in, projecting a wave of energy from her speed which knocks the Deviant back before Kingo delivers a shot that sends it off the shore and into the rocks below. Kingo compliments Makkari, who returns the compliment.[1]\nGilgamesh charges up the super strength in his fist and delivers a striking punch to a Deviant. This allows Thena to run up from behind and perform a maneuver to slice the Deviant's legs with her weapons. She stabs the creature's face multiple times as it attacks her. She then projects an axe and stabs its neck before Gilgamesh punches it once again. Thena flips onto the Deviant's back and stabs it through the neck, killing it. Gilgamesh takes Thena's hand as they walk away.[1]\nIn the air, Ikaris continues to evade the Deviant's attacks while shooting his optic lasers at it. He punches the Deviant into the ground.[1]\n\nThe Domo reveals itself\nThe civilians look up at the Domo as it removes its cloaking, revealing itself to the people. Druig, Sprite, Phastos, Ajak, and Sersi arrive on the ground from the Domo. The frightened civilians stand with weapons in hands, but Druig mind controls them to feel safer. Ajak then heals Ikaris' shoulder wound and he thanks her. The Eternals then stand in front of the Mesopotamians, signifying their arrival.[1]\nThe boy approaches Sersi, who, with permission from Ajak, takes a stone dagger that was lying on the ground and transforms it into a Golden Dagger, giving it to the boy.[1]\n4233 B.C.\nDruig starts to become overwhelmed by guilt having watched humans fight for so long, not being allowed to stop the fighting despite his ability to.[1][42]\nc. 4000 B.C.\nAs Wakanda devises new uses for vibranium, they become centuries ahead of the developed world technologically. They recognize they are susceptible to attack and begin to create a camouflage to hide the country, closing off from the world.[43][16]\nAgamotto forms the Masters of the Mystic Arts as a league of magic practitioners, dedicated to learning Magic so to safeguard the Earth from dimensional evils.[44][45]\nc. 3500 B.C.\nIn order to raise their chances in the war against their enemies, a rogue Kree faction visits numerous planets, genetically altering a number of sentient life forms in order to create biological weapons. One of the planets visited is Earth, and the Kree's experiments give rise to a unique caste of genetically altered Humans. When these humans are deemed ready for war, the Kree expose them to Terrigen Mist, which activates their special genetic ability of Terrigenesis; a process which imbues the human with a power unique to them. They construct the Diviners, containment devices built to hold Terrigen Crystals.[46] The Diviners will only open if one of these genetically altered humans brings them to a cityscape built beneath the planet's surface, releasing the mist so as to \"divine\" those who have the altered Terrigen Gene. The Kree hierarchy discovers the faction's illegal activities and the operation is abandoned. The Kree disperse from Earth, leaving behind six Diviners, the city, and at least one of their deceased kin. These genetically altered humans eventually start to call themselves \"Inhumans\".[47][46]\n\nRemnants of one of the nine cities of Maveth\nA powerful Inhuman, referred to as Alveus, is created by the Kree to dominate the rest of his race, but eventually overpowers his own creators and banishes them from Earth.[47][48][49] The humans and other Inhumans, afraid of his powers, banish him to a distant planet through a Kree Monolith. Followers of the exiled Inhuman found a secret society and start planning its return to Earth in order to let him rule it.[47][50]\nOn the distant planet, the Inhuman finds nine powerful and advanced, yet very divided, civilizations. The Inhuman consumes all life in these civilizations until they are completely wiped out.[47][51]\n3480 B.C.\nOdin Borson is born to Bor Burison, becoming the heir to the throne of Asgard.[38][52][2]\n3460 B.C.\nOdin defeats Surtur in battle.

They are stopped by the Asgardian army led by Bor, who successfully seized the Aether.[2][61][62]\nIn an effort to save his race, Malekith kills most of his army and much of Bor's army, then puts his remaining forces into a sleep which lasts for millennia. Bor orders for the Aether to be hidden in the deepest area possible, where no one can access it.[2][61][62]\n2787 B.C.\nAjak begins to notice something different about Earth, slowly becoming hesitant to help with the Emergence.[1][63]\nc. 2600 B.C.\nThe Maya civilization is established in Mesoamerica, the southern-most regions of North America.[32][25]\nc. 2570 B.C.\nThe Pyramid of Khafre is built in the Giza Pyramid Complex.[32][64]\nThe Great Pyramid of Giza is built in the Giza Pyramid Complex.[32][65]\nc. 2510 B.C.\nThe Pyramid of Menkaure is built in Cairo, Egypt.[32][64]\n2476 B.C.\nThe Dweller-in-Darkness attacks the peaceful people of Ta Lo, devouring the souls in its path.

The fact that these dates have actually appeared in the films make them more important. The 1917 date is the most fitting date to select, as it is the median of the 3 years, and because the \"1917-1944\" dates are already one year off with his date of death, which is said by Zola later in the film, and Sam Wilson in Captain America: Civil War, to have been in \"1945\", it is unlikely they would be two off. The assumption can be made that the error has come from the author knowing that Barnes died at age 27, and so adding 27 to his year of birth, 1917, not realising he only \"died\" a short while for his 28th birthday. As with Peggy Carter, where her file claimed she was born on April 9, 1919, but Emancipation established that it was April 9, 1921 instead, it can be taken that Barnes' SSR file also contains the correct date, but incorrect year of birth, therefore meaning he was born on March 10, 1917. This evidence is further solidified by Captain America: Brave New World, where Sam Wilson states in April 2027 (see 2027 references) that Barnes is 110 years old, seemingly not taking into account the 5 years he lost due to the Snap.\n SSR file on Barnes with the correct date, but wrong year of birth (as with Peggy Carter)\n Werewolf by Night\n Agent Carter: 2.02: A View in the Dark\n Captain America: Civil War\n Jessica Jones: 3.10: AKA Hero Pants\n Howard Stark's S.H.I.E.L.D.

The first Bollywood feature film, Raja Harishchandra, released on May 3, 1913, so Kingo would have start acting after then. Kingo can therefore be taken to have started acting around the midpoint of these dates: January 1919.\n Luke Cage: 1.05: Just to Get a Rep\n Cloak & Dagger: 2.01: Restless Energy\n In Soul Brother #1, it is said on August 22, 2017 (see 2017 references) to be Mabel Stokes' birthday.

In New Life, the Empire State Building's construction progress could reasonably be said to match November 1930-early 1931. So, given it is 1931, it should be January, February at a push. In The New Deal, a poster for Dracula, released February 12, 1931, and a poster for The Phantom of The West, released January 1, 1931, and a poster left over from a football game, with the closest season ending in December 1930, all also suggest January/February.\nIn Know Your Onions, Viola's passport includes an arrival in Berlin, dated \"FEB 12 1931\", meaning the earliest she could be back in New York is February 13, 1931. Given that she is in New York the day after the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrive, they would have to arrive on February 12, 1931 at the earliest.\nOverall, the episodes should be considered as early as possible, particularly for the Empire State Building's construction. Using the earliest allowable date based on Viola returning to New York from Berlin immediately, it can be taken that the S.H.I.E.L.D. agents arrived on February 12, 1931, and the events of The New Deal and Know Your Onions are on February 13-14, 1931.\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 6.13: New Life\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7.01: The New Deal\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7.02: Know Your Onions\n In Marvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline, Kingo stepping into the spotlight is dated to the \"1930s\" as \"Bollywood flourishes\" as a \"growing rival\" to Hollywood.

Katy says that her mother is American, implying that her grandfather moved before her mother's birth. Mrs. Chen's birth is approximated to June 1955 (see other references). The average age to have a child in 1955 was 28.7 years old, suggesting that Chen's father was born in approximately October 1926. Chen's father would have moved between his eighteenth birthday and his daughter's birth, so the moved can be approximated to February 1950.\n Cloak & Dagger: 1.05: Princeton Offense\n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n Captain America: Brave New World\n Luke Cage: 2.12: Can't Front on Me\n The Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.02: The Star-Spangled Man\n The Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.05: Truth\n In Marvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline, it is stated that the revived Super Soldier Program conducted on Isaiah Bradley occurred in the \"late 1940s/early 1950s\". It is implied in Star Spangled Man and Truth that the program only really returned in earnest during the Korean War, implying it began c. 1950. Because of this, the earliest restarting of the program has been placed to 1949, but there should ideally be roughly minimal time since it got started again in 1949 if it only properly resumed once the Korean War began (minimal time in apparent slow early redevelopment). So, it can be taken that the program kicked in properly as soon as Truman gave the order to help in Korea on June 27, 1950, so June 28, 1950.\n Captain Marvel\n Nick Fury's S.H.I.E.L.D.

Bradley later says that he was held in prison for \"thirty years.\" In Truth, Bradley explains that during the Korean War, he was given the Super Soldier Serum, that he was the only survivor, and that he rescued his fellow soldiers before being sent imprisoned. Distributing these events evenly does not place the fight between Barnes and Bradley in 1951, so it must be placed independently of the other two, in approximately the middle of the year, July 2, 1951. Bradley and the other soldiers receiving the serum can then be approximated to between that fight and the beginning of the Korean War on June 25, 1950, since it is implied to have happened during the war, so approximately December 28, 1950. Bradley rescuing his fellow soldiers can then be taken to have occurred between the fight between him and Barnes and the end of the Korean War on July 27, 1953, so approximately July 14, 1952.\nIn Truth, Bradley mentions that the people who had taken the serum began dying off before he rescued his men, so this can be approximated to the halfway point between receiving the serum and the rescue, so approximately October 6, 1951. Bradley also says in Truth that his superiors were planning to kill his team before he rescued them, and that \"one night\" after he overheard the plan, Bradley broke out. Bradley overhearing the plan can be approximated to three days prior, so that both Bradley's wording works and so that Bradley isn't waiting long enough that his superiors had already enacted their plan. After describing the rescue, Bradley says, \"It wasn't long before it was only me left.\" Since it is implied that Bradley was imprisoned shortly after he rescued the soldiers, Bradley can be taken to have been sent to prison a week later, with the rest of the serum users dying during that week. His imprisonment can then be taken to have happened on July 21, 1952, and the deaths in the middle of the time between the rescue and his imprisonment, so approximately July 17, 1952.\n Agatha All Along: 1.06: Familiar by Thy Side\n Luke Cage: 2.05: All Souled Out\n Runaways: 2.13: Split Up\n Jessica Jones: 2.06: AKA Facetime\n Avengers: Endgame\n Jessica Jones: 3.03: AKA I Have No Spleen\n Echo: 1.02: Lowak\n Luke Cage: 1.02: Code of the Streets\n Luke Cage: 2.01: Soul Brother #1\n Luke Cage: 1.06: Suckas Need Bodyguards\n Captain America: Civil War\n Jessica Jones: 2.02: AKA Freak Accident\n WandaVision: 1.09: The Series Finale\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.01: Orientation Part One\n Daredevil: 3.03: No Good Deed\n Luke Cage: 1.12: Soliloquy of Chaos\n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n Jessica Jones: 3.04: AKA Customer Service is Standing By\n Luke Cage: 1.01: Moment of Truth\n Black Widow\n Isodyne Manufacturing Document\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.19: The Only Light in the Darkness\n The Punisher: 1.02: Two Dead Men\n Based on a weighted calculation from John Kani's age at the time of filming Captain America: Civil War and Black Panther and working back from his scenes, and from Atandwa Kani's age at the time of filming Black Panther and working back from his scenes - reasoned against Sterling K. Brown's age at the time of filming Black Panther and working back from his scenes, considering that T'Chaka is older than N'Jobu.

His date of death is April 13, 2000 (see 2000s references), meaning he was born between January 1, 1954 and April 13, 1954, making his date of birth approximately February 1954.\n Jessica Jones: 2.01: AKA Start at the Beginning\n Jessica Jones: 2.03: AKA Sole Survivor\n Luke Cage: 2.13: They Reminisce Over You (T.R.O.Y.)\n Iron Man 2 - Black Widow: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.\n Thor\n Ant-Man and the Wasp\n Based on Robert Wisdom's age at the time of filming Helstrom, Caretaker can be taken to have been born in July 1954.\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.04: Is This Not Real Magic?\n Jessica Jones: 3.02: AKA You're Welcome\n WandaVision: 1.05: On a Very Special Episode...\n Secret Invasion: 1.02: Promises\n In Promises, Nick Fury says that when he and his mother went to Detroit, \"we always had to ride in the colored car.\" Trains in the United States were all integrated by January 10, 1956, suggesting that Fury lying about his friendship with Suzie happened before then. Fury also notes that, at the time of the conversation, \"Me and Suzie had a standing game of doctor we'd been playin' behind Old Man Jackson's barn.\" Playing doctor, children examining each other's genitals, is typical of children ages 3-6. Fury was born on July 4, 1950 (see other references), suggesting that he would have been playing doctor between July 4, 1953 and July 1957. Fury lying to his mother can therefore be approximated to between Fury's third birthday on July 4, 1953 and the integration of trains on January 10, 1956, placing it on October 6, 1954.\n Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.06: Just Jen\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 6.02: Window of Opportunity\n Eternals\n Guardians of the Galaxy\n In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Yondu says that he was sold into slavery as an infant and then spent 20 years in slavery, before Stakar Ogord freed him. Based on Michael Rooker's age when filming both movies, then working back from when both movies are set and taking an average, Yondu would have been born around January 1955, and so would have been sold around February 15th. 20 years later, he would have been freed around April 2, 1975. This fits with him then spending many years collecting Ego's children from 1975 up to any point between 1979 and 1988, then the final one, Quill, in 1988.\n Luke Cage: 2.10: The Main Ingredient\n Cloak & Dagger: 1.06: Funhouse Mirrors\n Based on Jodi Long's age at the time of filming her scene in Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings and working back from the scene's setting, Mrs. Chen would be born in approximately June 1955.\n Werewolf by Night\n Director by Night\n Werewolf by Night: The Art of the Special\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.12: The Real Deal\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7.03: Alien Commies from the Future!\n In Alien Commies from the Future!, Biff insists that he had seen a flying saucer the previous night. With this being said in the early hours of July 21, 1955, Biff would have seen the flying saucer in the night of July 19, 1955.\n In Out of the Past, it is explicitly said to be \"July 22nd, 1955\", making the events of Alien Commies from the Future! July 21, 1955.\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7.04: Out of the Past\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 3.07: Chaos Theory\n In Wig Out, it is said that Jackson Dillard was \"8 years older\" than Mariah. With Mariah's date of birth approximated to December 9, 1963 (see 1960s references), it can be approximated that Jackson was born around December 9, 1955, if not more generally meaning \"1963 - 1955 = 8\" then any point in 1955, approximating as mid-1985. Putting more weight in the specific December 9, 1955 but considering the possibility of generally 1955, a weighted average gives roughly October 17, 1955 - or, less specifically, October 1955 for Jackson's date of birth.\n Luke Cage: 2.03: Wig Out\n WandaVision: 1.08: Previously On\n WandaVision: 1.01: Filmed Before a Live Studio Audience\n The Incredible Hulk\n Avengers: Age of Ultron\n WandaVision: 1.07: Breaking the Fourth Wall\n The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\n In AKA Sole Survivor, it is shown that Alisa Jones was born in \"1956\" and seemingly died aged \"44\" in \"2000\". Her apparent date of death is April 13, 2000 (see 2000s references), meaning she was born between January 1, 1956 and April 13, 1956, making her date of birth approximately February 1956.\n Based on Dikran Tulaine's age at the time of filming Nakazat, working back from the setting of the episode, Nikolai Poloznev would have been born around June 1956.\n Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #503: New York Nine Newspaper Clipping\n Luke Cage: 1.13: You Know My Steez\n Ant-Man\n The Marvels\n Cloak & Dagger: 1.02: Suicide Sprints\n Daredevil: 3.05: The Perfect Game\n Runaways: 2.08: Past Life\n Echo: 1.01: Chafa\n The Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.04: The Whole World Is Watching\n In Scar Tissue, on May 2, 2018 (see 2018 references), Frank Castle says Arthur Walsh is \"about 60 years old\", implying he was born around November 1957. Given that actor Thomas G. Waites was 63 at the time of filming, it can be taken that he is a little older, born around September 1957.\n Daredevil: Born Again: 1.01: Heaven's Half Hour\n Cloak & Dagger: 2.01: Restless Energy\n The Avengers\n Avengers: Infinity War\n Runaways: 3.09: The Broken Circle\n Helstrom: 1.09: Vessels\n The Punisher: 2.02: Fight or Flight\n Helstrom: 1.01: Mother's Little Helpers\n Agatha All Along: 1.01: Seekest Thou the Road\n The Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.06: One World, One People\n Hawkeye: 1.06: So This Is Christmas?\n Luke Cage: 1.11: Now You're Mine\n Iron Fist: 2.02: The City's Not for Burning\n Runaways: 3.05: Enter The Dreamland\n Jessica Jones: 3.01: AKA The Perfect Burger\n Cloak & Dagger: 2.08: Two Player\n The Punisher: 2.04: Scar Tissue\n Cloak & Dagger: 2.02: White Lines\n Helstrom: 1.02: Viaticum\n Agatha All Along: 1.07: Death's Hand in Mine\n Cloak & Dagger: 2.06: B Sides\n Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n Runaways: 3.06: Merry Meet Again\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.03: The People vs. Emil Blonsky\n Daredevil: Born Again: 1.05: With Interest\n Luke Cage: 1.07: Manifest\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 6.06: Inescapable\n Runaways: 1.02: Rewind\nTimeline\nBefore 20th Century\tBefore 20th Century\n20th Century\t1900s • 1910s • 1920s • 1930s • 1940s • 1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s\n21st Century\t2000s\n2010 • 2011 • 2012 • 2013 • 2014 • 2015 • 2016 • 2017 • 2018 • 2019\n2020 • 2021 • 2022 • 2023 • 2024 • 2025 • 2026 • 2027\nFuture\t2040s • 2050s • 2070s • End of Time\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nMORE INFORMATION\nCategories\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Sci-fi Marvel\nOther Languages:\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\n\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nManage Preferences\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\n\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki is a FANDOM Movies Community.\nVIEW FULL SITE"

On top of this, Gunn later revealed that Meredith was 19 at the time of Peter's birth. With Peter's birth dated to October 27, 1980 (see 1980s references), this places her date of birth between October 28, 1960 and October 27, 1961. These together would place her date of birth between April 1, 1961 and October 27, 1961, the midpoint of which is July 15, 1961.\n Luke Cage: 2.03: Wig Out\n Luke Cage: 2.05: All Souled Out\n Luke Cage: 2.06: The Basement\n Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #503: New York Nine Newspaper Clipping\n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\n Helstrom: 1.04: Containment\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.20: Nothing Personal\n Luke Cage: 1.01: Moment of Truth\n Iron Fist: 2.08: Citadel on the Edge of Vengeance\n Iron Man\n WandaVision: 1.07: Breaking the Fourth Wall\n Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings\n Ms. Marvel: 1.01: Generation Why\n Black Panther\n Black Panther: Wakanda Forever\n Thor: Love and Thunder\n Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n Ms. Marvel: 1.02: Crushed\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.13: Principia\n Daredevil: Born Again: 1.03: The Hollow of His Hand\n In Cold Steel, it is shown that Rawlins was born in \"1962\" and graduated in \"1984\", therefore meaning he was most likely born between January 1, 1962 and August 31, 1962. This would mean that Rawlins was born around approximately early May 1962. Paul Schulze's age at the middle of filming for The Punisher: Season 1, working back from its late 2016 setting, would also place Rawlins' date of birth around early May 1962, so both these pieces of information can be used to approximate Rawlins' month of birth as May 1962.\n The Punisher: 1.08: Cold Steel\n In Snow Gives Way, an article is shown reporting \"Harold Meachum Dead at 41\". Working back from Harold's reasoned death date of January 2004 (See 2000s references), he would have been born around July 1962.\n Hawkeye: 1.02: Hide and Seek\n Luke Cage: 1.11: Now You're Mine\n Spider-Man: Homecoming Set Pic\n Echo: 1.05: Maya\n The Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.05: Truth\n In Truth, Isaiah Bradley says that Faith Bradley had been sending him letters while he was in prison, and that the CIA eventually told her he had died. Isaiah goes on to say that Faith died \"after a while.\" These two events can be evenly distributed between Isaiah's imprisonment on July 21, 1952 (see 1950s references) and his escape on November 20, 1982 (see 1980s references). This would place the CIA lying to Faith on approximately August 31, 1962, and Faith's death on approximately October 10, 1972. This works with both Faith sending him letters for a while and Bradley's line about her dying \"after a while.\"\n Runaways: 3.05: Enter The Dreamland\n Secret Invasion: 1.01: Resurrection\n Conflicting information is presented throughout Agatha All Along regarding Alice Wu-Gulliver's early life being raised by Lorna Wu. In Circle Sewn With Fate / Unlock Thy Hidden Gate, Agatha Harkness says to Wu-Gulliver, “What if you could finally answer the question that has been haunting you for most of your life? 'What happened to Mommy?'” This suggests that Wu-Gulliver was young when Wu died. However, she cannot have been younger than 13 years old, as that is the age Wu-Gulliver says she was when Wu made her get a tattoo of a protection spell. In If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You, a poster of a tour Wu went on is hung up with other posters for tours which are dated to May 1977, and Wu-Gulliver explains that “Two years after this tour, [Wu] had to sell the catalogue to keep our house,” suggesting that Wu was alive still in 1979. Furthermore, this being Wu-Gulliver's most notable example of the Wu Family Curse impacting the family in 1979 further suggests that Wu did not die until at least the following year. In If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You, several records are shown to be from a company called Audio Fidelity, which in the real world stopped releasing records under that name in 1984.\nWu is very heavily associated with the 1970s, and the trial on the Witches' Road which was designed to reveal information about Wu's death is themed for the decade, as Joe Locke confirmed in The Making of Agatha All Along, noting “We all have been transformed into 70s rock amazingness” for that trial. However, Wu's version of the Ballad of the Witches' Road has a copyright date of 1978 as shown on its record in Familiar by Thy Side. Furthermore, while living as William Kaplan, Billy Maximoff says, “[Wu] wrote the most famous version of the Ballad. My mom went to see her last tour right before she died.” Rebecca Kaplan is portrayed by Maria Dizzia, who was 17617 days old while filming her scenes in Agatha All Along, suggesting that Rebecca was born in either October 1971 or February 1977, depending on whether she survived the Snap. If Wu had indeed died in 1980, this would make Rebecca at most nine years old when she attended Wu's concert, which would make her very young.\nOverall, Wu and her death are heavily associated with the 1970s and Wu-Gulliver's early age. Overall, to fit all of the implications as best as possible, it can be taken that Wu-Gulliver was born in approximately December 1962, the tour with the poster in May 1977, the Ballad's release in 1978, Wu selling her catalog in May 1979, Wu-Gulliver getting her tattoo in June 1979, and Wu's death in January 1980. This allows Wu's death to be as close as possible to the decade with which it is associated while allowing selling the catalog to be a highly notable event and therefore separate from the year of Wu's death, and lets Wu-Gulliver be as young as possible to fit the implication of Wu-Gulliver having wondered what happened for “most of [her] life.” Rebecca Kaplan seeing the concert can be taken to have also happened in January 1980, letting her be as old as possible while fitting with Maximoff saying it was Wu's last tour.\n In Marvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline, it is clarified that Anton Vanko did indeed defect to the U.S.A. in 1963, as per dialogue in Iron Man 2, and not 1966 as a newspaper in Iron Man 2 suggests.\n Marvel Studios' The Marvel Cinematic Universe: An Official Timeline\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.15: Rise and Shine\n The Punisher: 2.01: Roadhouse Blues\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.01: A Normal Amount of Rage\n The Guardians of the Galaxy Holiday Special\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 6.07: Toldja\n Eternals\n Luke Cage: 1.02: Code of the Streets\n Runaways: 2.01: Gimmie Shelter\n Spider-Man: No Way Home\n Luke Cage: 1.04: Step in the Arena\n The Punisher: 1.05: Gunner\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 2.01: Shadows\n Guardians of the Galaxy\n Based on a weighted calculation from Forest Whitaker's age at the time of filming Black Panther and working back from his scenes, and from Denzel Whitaker's age at the time of filming Black Panther and working back from his scenes.

The average age of first-time fathers in the United States in the 1970s was 27.4 years old, and the average age in Japan was lower than it was now, so can be approximated to 29.2 years old. Since it is unclear whether Yori had RJ before or after moving to the United States, his age at RJ's birth can be approximated to 28.3 years old. With Yori born in Spring 1936 (see 1930s references), RJ's birth can be approximated to the summer of 1964.\n Echo: 1.02: Lowak\n Jessica Jones: 2.05: AKA The Octopus\n Marvel One-Shot: All Hail the King\n Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #602: Mariah Dillard's Scrapbook\n Maiden Mother Crone shows several scenes of Agatha Harkness killing groups of witches, using the clothing to indicate the passage of time. The first killing separate from Nicholas Scratch's death shows the witches in Victorian outfits. Daniel Selon posted on this outfit on Instagram with the caption, “To my dearest Agatha, 1893 really was your year.” This killing can be taken to have happened at the midpoint of 1893, July 2. The next group appear to be dressed for the 1960s, so their killing can be placed in the midpoint of the 1960s, December 31, 1964. The next group appear to be dressed for the 1990s, so the midpoint of the 1990s can be applied to that killing.\n Agatha All Along: 1.09: Maiden Mother Crone\n Luke Cage: 1.09: DWYCK\n Iron Fist: 2.10: A Duel of Iron\n Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness\n Agatha All Along: 1.02: Circle Sewn With Fate / Unlock Thy Hidden Gate\n Agatha All Along: 1.06: Familiar by Thy Side\n Echo: 1.03: Tuklo\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.03: Uprising\n In Captain Marvel: Higher, Further, Faster., Garrett Pierre is shown entering the United States Air Force Academy at the same time as Carol Danvers, suggesting that he was in the same academic class as Danvers, those born between September 1964 and September 1965. Pierre's birth can therefore be approximated to the midpoint of these dates, March 1965.\n Secret Invasion: 1.04: Beloved\n Helstrom: 1.09: Vessels\n In Ant-Man and the Wasp, Bill Foster is shown to be approximately 56 (Laurence Fishburne's age at the time of filming) in Spring 2018, and Ava Starr is shown to be approximately 28 (Hannah John-Kamen's age at the time of filming) in Spring 2018. The flashbacks showing a young Ava show Bill Foster through a mix of Laurence Fishburne's son, Langston, 29 at the time of filming, and deageing Laurence Fishburne to how he looked c. 1986, aged 25. Ava is shown to be approximately 7 (RaeLynn Bratten's age at the time of filming). Overall, it can be calculated that Foster was born around July 1965 and Starr around August 1988, and the flashbacks are approximately November 2-4, 1995, when Foster is 30 and Starr is 7.\n Runaways: 1.03: Destiny\n Luke Cage: 2.12: Can't Front on Me\n Kree (and Carol Danvers, following her blood transfusion giving her Kree biology) are shown in the MCU to age slower than humans.\nCraig Parker plays Taryan in Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: Season 5, filming at 47.4 years old for scenes set in late May 2018 (see 2018 references). Samuel Roukin plays Faulnak, Taryan's son, in the same season, filming at 37.1 years old for scenes set in late December 2091 (see 2091 references). So, assuming Taryan to have been approximately 30.9 in human years, the average age at which men become fathers for the first time, then Faulnak would be approximately 68.0 in human years in late 2091, making 73.6 years only equivalent to about 68.0 (68.029) - 47.4 (47.355) = 20.7 human ageing years.\nBoth Ronan and Carol Danvers are shown to have barely aged at all in a couple of decades. Lee Pace, who plays Ronan, was 34.4 during filming for Guardians of the Galaxy, set in early August 2014 (see 2014 references), but 39.1 during filming for Captain Marvel, set in mid-June 1995 (see 1990s references), implying that Ronan is supposed to look roughly 36 from 1995 through to 2014, for 19.1 years. Similarly, Brie Larson, who plays Carol Danvers, was 28.1 during filming for Avengers: Endgame, set predominantly in October 2023 (see 2023 references), while 28.6 during filming for Captain Marvel, set in mid-June 1995, implying that Danvers is supposed to look roughly 28 from 1995 through to 2023, for 28.4 years.\nOverall, therefore, roughly 73.6 + 19.1 + 28.4 = 121.1 years is supposed to equate to only 20.7 + 0 + 0 = 20.7 years of ageing in human years for Kree, suggesting Kree age roughly 121.1 ÷ 20.7 = 5.9 × slower than humans.\nSo, taking a weighted calculation to assume that, given Brie Larson's ages at the times of filming and the films' respective settings, Danvers is supposed to be about 28.3 (weighted average of her age filming Captain Marvel and filming Avengers: Endgame) in roughly October 2009 (weighted average of setting dates of Captain Marvel and Avengers: Endgame), she would therefore have been, 20.3 years earlier at the time of her transfusion on June 23, 1989 (see 1980s references), roughly 20.3 ÷ 5.9 = 3.4 human years younger, 24.9.\nWith Danvers then supposed to be approximately 24.9 at the time of her transfusion in June 1989, and human before that point, her date of birth would be approximated to early August 1964. However, Captain Marvel: Higher, Further, Faster. establishes that Danvers joining the United States Air Force Academy, dated to July 6, 1984 (see 1980s references), happened soon after she graduated high school, suggesting she was the Class of 1984. Additionally, the narrative says that Danvers was \"eighteen\" while in high school, which would only be possible if she had turned eighteen during the course of her senior year. Both of these together suggest Danvers was born between September 1965 and June 1966. Furthermore, in Captain Marvel, Mckenna Grace, who is credited as \"Young Carol (13 Years Old),\" plays Danvers in flashbacks dated to \"1978\" in behind-the-scenes images. With Danvers having to be thirteen in these scenes, this puts her date of birth in December 1965 at the latest. All of this together places her date of birth between September and December 1965. To accommodate for Larson's age suggesting August 1964, Danvers' date of birth can be placed as early as possible in September 1965. The full details of the calculations may be found here.\n [Melinda May's S.H.I.E.L.D.

In the flashback, neon lights are shown, which fell out of popularity in the 1960s. Ajak is singing \"Losing You\" by Brenda Lee in the flashback, which released on February 20, 1963. It can therefore be taken that Ajak and Sprite last saw each other at the midpoint of the song's release and the end of the 1960s, so approximately July 1966.\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.02: Superhuman Law\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.05: Rewind\n Ms. Marvel: 1.05: Time and Again\n Daredevil: 2.02: Dogs to a Gunfight\n Secret Invasion: 1.02: Promises\n The Punisher: 2.06: Nakazat\n The Punisher: 2.08: My Brother's Keeper\n Moon Knight: 1.06: Gods and Monsters\n Echo: 1.01: Chafa\n Jessica Jones: 2.08: AKA Ain't We Got Fun\n Luke Cage: 2.09: For Pete's Sake\n Based on Zenobia Shroff's age during the filming of Ms. Marvel and working backward from its setting, Muneeba Khan would have been born on January 10, 1970 if she survived the Snap and August 24, 1964 if she did not. The average of these dates can be approximated, placing Khan's date of birth in May 1967.\n Iron Man 2: Public Identity, Issue 2\n The Wakanda Files: A Technological Exploration of the Avengers and Beyond\n Runaways: 1.09: Doomsday\n Jessica Jones: 3.12: AKA A Lotta Worms\n Jessica Jones: 2.06: AKA Facetime\n The Punisher: 1.01: 3 AM\n In Code Yellow, Harold Simcoe is stated to have been \"51\" when he died on June 27, 2019 (see 2019 references). This means he was born between June 28, 1967 and June 27, 1968, so his date of birth can be approximated to December 1967.\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 6.04: Code Yellow\n Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania\n The Avengers\n Loki: 2.06: Glorious Purpose\n Using Meredith Salenger's age at the time of filming No Good Deed, working back from the setting, Lily Ellison would have been born around January 1970. However, using Chris Carfizzi's age at the time of filming No Good Deed, working back from the setting, Jason Ellison would have been born around April 1975. Jason says Mitchell and Lily Ellison renewed their wedding vows when he was 8, but, using these ages, Lily would have only been around 13. So, Lily Ellison must have been born earlier than January 1970, and Jason later than April 1975. Adjusting so that Lily was at least 18, it can be calculated that Lily was born around January 1968 and Jason late January 1977, with the vows renewed around January 28, 1986, just after Lily turned 18 and before Jason turned 9. The details of the calculation may be found here.\n Whiplash History Files\n In Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings, Trevor Slattery says that his mother took him to see Planet of the Apes in \"1968.\" The movie released on April 12 in the United Kingdom, where Slattery lived. Movies tend to remain in theaters for approximately four weeks, so Slattery could have seen the film between April 12 and May 10. Slattery can therefore be approximated to have seen the movie on April 26, 1968.\n In I Get Physical, Mariah Dillard says Buggy Stokes had Harlem's Paradise commissioned in the \"late '60s\". If the first third of the '60s is \"early\", the middle third is \"mid\", and the final third is \"late\", then the \"late '60s\" can be approximated as the middle of the final third of the '60s - ⅚ through the decade. This is May 2, 1968.\n In Captain Marvel, Nick Fury is shown to have been born on \"07/04/1950\", July 4, 1950, and says he was born in Alabama. He then says he became a soldier \"straight outta high school\". By Alabama kindergarten entrance age, Fury would have started kindergarten in September 1955, meaning he would finish high school in Spring 1968. He can then be assumed to have become a soldier during Summer 1968, approximately July 1968.\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.10: The Bridge\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 6.06: Inescapable\n James Rhodes' Department of Defense ID card\n Iron Man 3\n Hawkeye: 1.05: Ronin\n Daredevil: 1.06: Condemned\n The Defenders: 1.02: Mean Right Hook\n In Nakazat, Nikolai Poloznev talks about watching a man be killed when he was \"maybe 12 years old\". With Poloznev's date of birth approximated to June 1956 (see 1950s references), specifically June 24, 1956, the middle of his time as a 12-year-old - as an approximation for when this occurred - would be roughly December 23, 1968.\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 2.18: The Frenemy of My Enemy\n Hawkeye: 1.03: Echoes\n Captain America: The First Avenger\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.15: Self Control\n Helstrom: 1.10: Hell Storm\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7.01: The New Deal\n MPower: 1.01: The Women of Black Panther\n Loki: 1.01: Glorious Purpose\n Daredevil: 3.03: No Good Deed\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 2.16: Afterlife\n In Captain Marvel: Higher, Further, Faster., Garrett Pierre describes two air shows he saw before attending the United States Air Force Academy: one in which he saw T-38 Talons being flown, and another in which he saw the Silver Eagles. Pierre would have seen these shows after starting to develop explicit memories at two years old, but before the deadline to apply for the Academy on December 31 of his senior year. Pierre's birth is approximated to March 1965 (see 1960s references), so these trips occurred between March 1967 and and December 31, 1982. The Silver Eagles were only active from January 1972 through November 23, 1976, so Pierre seeing them can be approximated to the midpoint of these dates, June 1974. The Talons show can then be approximated to the midpoint of then and Pierre's second birthday, placing it in November 1969.\n Luke Cage: 1.06: Suckas Need Bodyguards\n Jessica Jones: 2.01: AKA Start at the Beginning\n Bruce Banner's Culver University ID card\nTimeline\nBefore 20th Century\tBefore 20th Century\n20th Century\t1900s • 1910s • 1920s • 1930s • 1940s • 1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s\n21st Century\t2000s\n2010 • 2011 • 2012 • 2013 • 2014 • 2015 • 2016 • 2017 • 2018 • 2019\n2020 • 2021 • 2022 • 2023 • 2024 • 2025 • 2026 • 2027\nFuture\t2040s • 2050s • 2070s • End of Time\nMORE INFORMATION\nCategories\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Sci-fi Marvel\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\n\nJust for You\n\nPopular Pages\n\n\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nManage Preferences\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\n\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki is a FANDOM Movies Community.\nVIEW FULL SITE\"\n https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/1960s#:~:text=Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe,VIEW%20FULL%20SITE"

This means Lyonne and Hogarth graduated in 1993, making their dates of birth likely December 1969-December 1970, approximately June 1970.\nBased on Sarita Choudhury's age at the time of filming Jessica Jones: Season 3, working back from its setting, Lyonne would have been born around April 1966.

London Fuller, who plays Danvers in these moments, is said in the credits to be playing \"Young Carol (6 Years Old)\", making Danvers approximately 6.5. Fuller herself was 7.0 years old during filming, suggesting Danvers is slightly closer to 6.99 than 6.0.\nDanvers' date of birth is dated to September 1965 (see 1960s references), approximated specifically to September 16, 1965, so it can be calculated that these moments take place around roughly March 29, 1972. Pushing the events to a week apart each, they can be then taken to be roughly March 22, March 29, and April 5, 1972.

Taking a weighted average of William Hurt's age during the filming of The Incredible Hulk, Captain America: Civil War, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, and Black Widow suggests Ross would have been born around c. 1952. However, this would put his return around 1979. The last American troops withdrew from Vietnam in March 1973, and Betty Ross was born on May 11, 1973, meaning Thaddeus would have had to have been back in the United States by August 1972 to conceive her, so it can be assumed that he withdrew about a month before this point, July 1972.\n In Familiar by Thy Side, a news article refers to the footage of Dolly Parton slapping Agatha Harkness as being from \"1972.\" This can be approximated to the midpoint of the year, July 1972.\n The Punisher: 1.04: Resupply\n Through a series of calculations, taking into account actor ages working back from present events and flashback settings, and evidence from Luke Cage, it can be found that Cottonmouth was born around September 1972 (with him said in Manifest to have been 14 when he killed Pistol Pete, dated to April 6, 1987 (see 1980s references)), and Sheldon and Bushmaster were born around June 1973 (with them said in The Creator to overlap in age, so less than a year apart).

Isaiah goes on to say that Faith died \"after a while.\" These two events can be evenly distributed between Isaiah's imprisonment on July 21, 1952 (see 1950s references) and his escape on November 20, 1982 (see 1980s references). This would place the CIA lying to Faith on approximately August 31, 1962, and Faith's death on approximately October 10, 1972. This works with both Faith sending him letters for a while and Bradley's line about her dying \"after a while.\"\n Doctor Strange\n Marcus Daniels' S.H.I.E.L.D.

It is stated in Speak of the Devil, The Path of the Righteous, and The Devil You Know that Wilson Fisk was 12 when he killed his father, which would be c. December 1971. The kill is shown in Shadows in the Glass to be on the day of a New York City 3rd council district election, and the closest was November 6, 1973, so the kill can be placed then (with Fisk actually born c. 1961). This matches with it being said in February 2015 (see 2015 references), in The Path of the Righteous, to be \"40-some years ago\".\n A Brujapedia article in Familiar by Thy Side says that Harkness was last seen in \"Nashville, Tennessee in 1973.\" The same episode establishes that the song \"Jolene\" by Dolly Parton, which released in October 1973, was based on Harkness. It can therefore be approximated that Harkness left at the midpoint of the remainder of the year, December 1, 1973.\n Daredevil: 1.13: Daredevil\n Jasper Sitwell's S.H.I.E.L.D.

Iron Man shows her birthday to be the day before Tony is kidnapped - approximately February 10th.

Pierre would have seen these shows after starting to develop explicit memories at two years old, but before the deadline to apply for the Academy on December 31 of his senior year. Pierre's birth is approximated to March 1965 (see 1960s references), so these trips occurred between March 1967 and and December 31, 1982. The Silver Eagles were only active from January 1972 through November 23, 1976, so Pierre seeing them can be approximated to the midpoint of these dates, June 1974. The Talons show can then be approximated to the midpoint of then and Pierre's second birthday, placing it in November 1969.\n Iron Fist: 2.02: The City's Not for Burning\n In Eternals, Kingo says on October 15, 2024 (see 2024 references), \"Karun, he's worked for me for 50 years, I trust him completely.\" \"50 years\" could refer to \"exactly fifty years,\" so September 26, 1974; \"in 1974;\" or \"in the 1970s.\" A weighted calculation, putting more weight on the more specific, puts Patel and Kingo meeting on September 24, 1974.\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.07: The Retreat\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.04: Is This Not Real Magic?\n The Punisher: 1.07: Crosshairs\n Ant-Man\n Runaways: 3.05: Enter The Dreamland\n Iron Man\n In Iron Man, it is said that Tony Stark built his first circuit board at \"age 4.\" With Stark's birthday on May 29, 1970, Stark could have built the circuit board at any time between May 29, 1974 and May 28, 1975. Stark building the circuit board can therefore be contributed to the midpoint of these dates, November 26, 1974.\n Eternals Deleted Scene\n Hawkeye: 1.06: So This Is Christmas?\n Daredevil: 2.11: .380\n Based on Parisa Fitz-Henley's age at the time of filming Jessica Jones: Season 1 and Luke Cage: Season 1 and Season 2, working back from the setting of her appearances in 2013 and 2014, Reva Connors would have been born around February 1975.\n In Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Yondu says that he was sold into slavery as an infant and then spent 20 years in slavery, before Stakar Ogord freed him. Based on Michael Rooker's age when filming both movies, Yondu would have been born around January 1955, and so would have been sold around February. 20 years later, he would have been freed in April 1975. This fits with him then spending many years collecting Ego's children from 1975 up to any point between 1980 and 1988, then the final one, Quill, in 1988.\n Avengers: Age of Ultron\n Peter's To-Do List\n The Marvels\n In Captain Marvel: Higher, Further, Faster., Carol Danvers says that she attempted to imitate a girl \"in my fourth-grade class.\" She then says that, \"I spent all year trying to copy her.\" Based on Danvers' September 1965 date of birth (see other references) and the fact that this was a year-long goal, it can be taken that Danvers first noted this classmate in September 1975, the start of her fourth grade year.\n The Making of Loki Season 2\n Eric Martin said in an interview about Hunter X-05, \"So he got into that life, and he’s been enjoying it for maybe a couple years,\" suggesting that it has been approximately two years since his arrival on the Sacred Timeline by the time Loki and Mobius M. Mobius find him on November 6, 1977. A weighted calculation places Hunter X-05's arrival on approximately September 24, 1975.\n James Hiroyuki Liao was approximately 41.8 at the time of filming The Fury of Iron Fist. Working back from the October 3, 2017 setting (see 2017 references), Albert would have been born around November 1975.\n Daredevil: Born Again: 1.08: Isle of Joy\n Luke Cage: 2.02: Straighten It Out\n Loki: 1.04: The Nexus Event\n Moon Knight: 1.03: The Friendly Type\n Secret Invasion: 1.01: Resurrection\n Based on Dorian Missick's age at the time of filming Luke Cage: Season 2, working back from the setting of his appearances in August 2017, Cockroach Hamilton would have been born around March 1976.\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.09: Whose Show is This?\n Ms. Marvel: 1.01: Generation Why\n Jessica Jones: 3.03: AKA I Have No Spleen\n Jessica Jones: 3.13: AKA Everything\n Moon Knight: 1.05: Asylum\n WandaVision: 1.04: We Interrupt This Program\n Based on Annie Wersching's ages of 40, 41, and 42 during filming for Runaways: Seasons 1-3, set October 2017 (see 2017 references)-May 2018 (see 2018 references), Leslie Ellerh/Dean would have been born around late 1976. Based on Charlie Townsend being 5 during filming for Past Life but credited as a \"toddler Leslie\", she is likely supposed to be almost 3 in \"1979\", suggesting she was born in 1976. Based on Mia Topalian being 25 during filming for Last Rites and the scene set around late 1997, \"twenty years\" before the present events in November 2017, she was born around 1972. Overall, a weighted calculation would place Leslie's birth around July 1976, the \"1979\" flashback around June 18, 1979 when she's almost 3, and the \"twenty years earlier\" flashback around November 5, 1997 when she's 21, with her being 41 in present events.\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 7.06: Adapt or Die\n Based on Benedict Cumberbatch's age during filming Doctor Strange, Thor: Ragnarok, Avengers: Infinity War, Avengers: Endgame, Spider-Man: No Way Home and Doctor Strange in the Multiverse of Madness and working back from those movies' settings, Strange's birth can be approximated to August 17, 1976.\n On Marvel's timeline, it is shown that this occurred 33 years before \"I am Iron Man,\" which is dated to November 25, 2009, putting it around October 1976.\n Marvel's timeline\n In Iron Man, it is said that Tony Stark built his first engine at \"age 6.\" With Stark's birthday on May 29, 1970, that would place this event between May 29, 1976 and May 28, 1977, the midpoint of which is November 26, 1976.\nTony Stark is shown to have been featured on Popular Mechanics due to him building an engine at such a young age. Popular Mechanics issues are released monthly, so it can be approximated to be two months following Tony building the engine, giving the magazine enough time to write the story.\n The Punisher: 1.06: The Judas Goat\n Agatha All Along: 1.05: Darkest Hour / Wake Thy Power\n Using Meredith Salenger's age at the time of filming No Good Deed, working back from the setting, Lily Ellison would have been born around January 1970. However, using Chris Carfizzi's age at the time of filming No Good Deed, working back from the setting, Jason Ellison would have been born around April 1975. Jason says Mitchell and Lily Ellison renewed their wedding vows when he was 8, but, using these ages, Lily would have only been around 13. So, Lily Ellison must have been born earlier than January 1970, and Jason later than April 1975. Adjusting so that Lily was at least 18, it can be calculated that Lily was born around January 1968 and Jason late January 1977, with the vows renewed around January 28, 1986, just after Lily turned 18 and before Jason turned 9. The details of the calculation may be found here.\n Moon Knight: 1.06: Gods and Monsters\n Agatha All Along: 1.04: If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 3.04: Devils You Know\n In Please, it is said on October 23, 2017 (see 2017 references) that Edward Nelson has been slinging meat for \"40 years\". This could refer to a very exact 40 years (around October 23, 1977), a more general \"2017 - 1977 = 40\" (so approximating with mid-1977, July 2, 1977), or an even more general \"2010s - 1970s = 40 years\" (so approximating with the mid-1970s, December 31, 1974/January 1, 1975). Putting the most weight in the most specific, and least in the least specific, a weighted calculation gives him starting as approximately April 27, 1977.\n In If It Ain't Rough, It Ain't Right, it is stated that Shades and Comanche met at age \"7\", meaning they are less than a year apart in age. In Can't Front on Me, Shades says he was born on \"May 11th, 1977.\" Thomas Q. Jones' age at the time of filming Step in the Arena, working back from the 2013 placement of the flashbacks he appears in, and his age at the time of filming Luke Cage: Season 2, working back from the August 2017 setting, would place Comanche's date of birth a little later than this, but overall, the best estimate for Comanche's date of birth is still May 1977.\n Conflicting information is presented throughout Agatha All Along regarding Alice Wu-Gulliver's early life being raised by Lorna Wu. In Circle Sewn With Fate / Unlock Thy Hidden Gate, Agatha Harkness says to Wu-Gulliver, “What if you could finally answer the question that has been haunting you for most of your life? 'What happened to Mommy?'” This suggests that Wu-Gulliver was young when Wu died. However, she cannot have been younger than 13 years old, as that is the age Wu-Gulliver says she was when Wu made her get a tattoo of a protection spell. In If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You, a poster of a tour Wu went on is hung up with other posters for tours which are dated to May 1977, and Wu-Gulliver explains that “Two years after this tour, [Wu] had to sell the catalogue to keep our house,” suggesting that Wu was alive still in 1979. Furthermore, this being Wu-Gulliver's most notable example of the Wu Family Curse impacting the family in 1979 further suggests that Wu did not die until at least the following year. In If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You, several records are shown to be from a company called Audio Fidelity, which in the real world stopped releasing records under that name in 1984.\nWu is very heavily associated with the 1970s, and the trial on the Witches' Road which was designed to reveal information about Wu's death is themed for the decade, as Joe Locke confirmed in The Making of Agatha All Along, noting “We all have been transformed into 70s rock amazingness” for that trial. However, Wu's version of the Ballad of the Witches' Road has a copyright date of 1978 as shown on its record in Familiar by Thy Side. Furthermore, while living as William Kaplan, Billy Maximoff says, “[Wu] wrote the most famous version of the Ballad. My mom went to see her last tour right before she died.” Rebecca Kaplan is portrayed by Maria Dizzia, who was 17617 days old while filming her scenes in Agatha All Along, suggesting that Rebecca was born in either October 1971 or February 1977, depending on whether she survived the Snap. If Wu had indeed died in 1980, this would make Rebecca at most nine years old when she attended Wu's concert, which would make her very young.\nOverall, Wu and her death are heavily associated with the 1970s and Wu-Gulliver's early age. Overall, to fit all of the implications as best as possible, it can be taken that Wu-Gulliver was born in approximately December 1962, the tour with the poster in May 1977, the Ballad's release in 1978, Wu selling her catalog in May 1979, Wu-Gulliver getting her tattoo in June 1979, and Wu's death in January 1980. This allows Wu's death to be as close as possible to the decade with which it is associated while allowing selling the catalog to be a highly notable event and therefore separate from the year of Wu's death, and lets Wu-Gulliver be as young as possible to fit the implication of Wu-Gulliver having wondered what happened for “most of [her] life.” Rebecca Kaplan seeing the concert can be taken to have also happened in January 1980, letting her be as old as possible while fitting with Maximoff saying it was Wu's last tour.\n Spider-Man: Homecoming\n Iron Fist: 1.11: Lead Horse Back to Stable\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.17: Identity and Change\n Runaways: 1.04: Fifteen\n Runaways: 1.06: Metamorphosis\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 4.12: Hot Potato Soup\n Iron Man 3\n Daredevil: 1.03: Rabbit in a Snowstorm\n Blackout Cripples NY prop\n WandaVision: 1.07: Breaking the Fourth Wall\n In AKA WWJD?, Kilgrave says, \"[My parents] ran away. From promising careers... and their 10-year-old son.\" He also discusses how he was 10 when they left in AKA Sin Bin, which also features Jessica being told by Professor Davies that Albert and Louise Thompson, Kilgrave's parents, \"skipped town in '88.\" With this dated to May 9, 1988, Kilgrave would have been born around November 1977.\n Jessica Jones: 1.09: AKA Sin Bin\n Based on Chaz Lamar Shepherd's age at the time of filming Luke Cage: Season 2, working back from the setting of his appearances in August 2017, Piranha Jones would have been born around November 1977.\n Pete's Dragon - Release Info\n In Breaking Brad, Brad Wolfe is shown attending the premiere for the movie The Zaniac! in what a title card depicts is \"1977.\" In The Making of Loki Season 2, The Zaniac! is confirmed to be based on a comic book. In the 1970s, comic book movies tended to release between July and March. The average of the release dates within this range can be taken to be the release date for The Zaniac!, November 6, 1977.\n Loki: 2.06: Glorious Purpose\n The Falcon and The Winter Soldier: 1.03: Power Broker\n Hawkeye: 1.01: Never Meet Your Heroes\n The Avengers\n In Doctor Hastings' Files, an article published on April 23, 1996 refers to Rebecca Torres as \"a senior majoring in economics.\" To be a college senior, Torres would have been in the high school class of 1992, making her first years of kindergarten the 1983-1984 school year. The Texas cutoff date for kindergarten in 1983 was to be five years by September 1, so Torres was born between September 2, 1977 and September 1, 1978. Therefore, Torres' date of birth can be approximated to March 3, 1978.\n Doctor Hastings' Files: Third Victim Found, No Suspects\n Jessica Jones: 2.02: AKA Freak Accident\n Marvel Television Live Auction Lot #602: Mariah Dillard's Scrapbook\n In Iron Man, Obadiah Stane says, \"We haven't had a breakthrough in that in what? 30 years\" on the reasoned date of May 3, 2008. This could refer to specifically on May 3, 1978 or more generally within the year 1978. A weighted calculation places this breakthrough on May 24, 1978.\n In You Know My Steez, a flashback is shown of Willis training Carl at boxing. In the background is a notice about an event coming up on \"Friday November 15\" (which would be 1996) and then \"Monday 6-10 January\" (1997), placing this around early November 1996. It is shown in Take It Personal that in May of whichever year (it refers to the car being a \"1993\" model, so at least 1994 or 1995 to refer to it as such), when Willis was 18 and Carl was 17, they stole a 1993 corvette. It can be assumed, considering the fact that the actors already look older than 16 and 18 in the November 1996 flashback and Mike Colter's age at the times of filming suggesting Luke would have turned 17 around the early 1990s, as well as the way the brothers' story is told, it can be assumed that they stole the car in the first May after the November 1996 flashback, May 1997. In Take It Personal, Luke says, \"He was 2 years older than me,\" and in Now You're Mine, Willis says, \"And everything was good until the preacher's wife, 2 years later, had a baby boy.\" With the paper saying they are 17 and 18 in May 1997, it can be assumed that they are about 1 year and 10 months apart in age, with Carl having just turned 17 and Willis about to turn 19, placing their dates of birth in April 1980 and June 1978 respectively.\n Luke Cage: 1.10: Take It Personal\n Luke Cage: 1.13: You Know My Steez\n In AKA Facetime, it is stated that Karl Malus was the \"class of 1978.\" In AKA Three Lives and Counting, it is said that he died aged \"57\" in May 2017, making him born between May 1959 and May 1960 and therefore meaning he began, not finished, university in 1978. He would start around September.\n Jessica Jones: 2.06: AKA Facetime\n Avengers: Infinity War Deleted Scene\n Echo: 1.03: Tuklo\n It is stated in On and On that Buggy Stokes killed Quincy McIver and McIver shot him back, resulting in Stokes' death \"5 months\" later. Quicny McIver's death has to be after the conception of his son, John. With John's date of birth approximated to June 1973 (see other references), specifically June 23, 1973, his conception was likely approximately 267 days earlier, so September 29, 1972. Stokes' death has to be before the mid-1980s flashbacks in The Creator, dated to February 11, 1985 (see 1980s references). So, the two events are between September 29, 1972/February 28, 1973 (t months later for Stokes' death) and September 11, 1984 (5 months earlier for Quincy's death)/February 11, 1985. The midpoint between these dates is September 20, 1978/February 20, 1979, making the shooting approximately September 20, 1978 and Stokes' death approximately February 20, 1979.\n Marvel Studios Secret Archives | The Falcon and The Winter Soldier | Available on Disney+ (translated from Spanish)\n The Making of The Falcon and The Winter Soldier\n In AKA Shark in the Bathtub, Monster in the Bed, Jeri Hogarth says she wore yellow to a funeral aged \"8.\" Hogarth's date of birth is approximated as April 1970 (see other references), making the time she was 8 years old April 1978-April 1979, so this occurred around approximately October 1978.\n Jessica Jones: 2.09: AKA Shark in the Bathtub, Monster in the Bed\n In Captain Marvel, three instances are shown of a young teenage Carol Danvers: one of her picking herself up after a bike fall, one of her go karting (a photograph from the day, a memory of her crashing a kart, and her getting back up), and thirdly of picking herself up in a baseball game. Behind-the-scenes photos show that these flashbacks take place in \"1978.\" Mckenna Grace, who plays Danvers in these moments, is said in the credits to be playing \"Young Carol (13 Years Old).\" With Danvers' date of birth dated to September 1965 (see 1960s references), this places these flashbacks between September and December 1978, the only period when Danvers would be thirteen in 1978. Danvers being \"13 Years Old\" suggests these scenes take place closer to when she was 13.5. However, Grace herself was 11.9 years old during filming, suggesting Danvers is slightly closer to 13.0 than 13.99. These together would suggest Danvers is roughly 13.4, implying these scenes should occur closer to December 1978. However, the final flashback features Danvers playing a game of Little League baseball, which is typically not played any later than mid-October due to weather. Games are usually played over the weekend during the school year, so this flashback can dated to Sunday, October 15, 1978, being as close as possible to the ideal December 1978 placement. The previous two flashbacks can be taken to occur over the two weeks leading to this date, placing the first flashback on October 1, 1978 and the second flashback on October 8, 1978.

T'Challa Became a Star-Lord?\n She-Hulk: Attorney at Law: 1.01: A Normal Amount of Rage\n Marie Thompson's Nurse Badge in Harvest\n In Black Widow, Dreykov is shown meeting with Jimmy Carter during his presidency. Carter's presidency lasted from January 21, 1977-January 21, 1981, so his meeting with Dreykov can be approximated to the middle of these two dates, January 20, 1979.\n In The Basement, it is said that Ridenhour and Dillard were in a relationship when Ridenhour was in \"ninth, tenth, and eleventh\" grade. With Ridenhour's date of birth approximated to January 1964 (see 1960s references), by the New York system, he would be in ninth grade from early September 1978 to late June 1979. Approximating when they entered the relationship by using the middle of the school year, they would have got together around approximately January 31, 1979.\n Luke Cage: 1.08: Blowin' Up the Spot\n The Punisher: 2.01: Roadhouse Blues\n Runaways: 2.03: Double Zeros\n Agatha All Along: 1.03: Through Many Miles / Of Tricks and Trials\n In Past Life, a flashback is shown in \"1979\" of Jonah meeting David Ellerh, including a \"toddler\" (according to the credits) Leslie Ellerh. Factoring this into Leslie's age, but also factoring Leslie's age into this placement, a calculation would place the scene on June 18, 1979 (with Leslie born in July 1976, almost 3 years old). David's abandonment of his wife, Susan, shown in Earth Angel, can then be assumed to be around 2 months later, roughly August 18, 1979.\n Runaways: 2.08: Past Life\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.01: Orientation Part One\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.03: A Life Spent\n John Collins' New Jersey Driver's License\n Runaways: 2.12: Earth Angel\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 1.01: Pilot\n In Leviathan, Victoria Helstrom says that she visited San Francisco \"as a kid.\" With Helstrom's birth approximated to September 1970 (see other references), it can be approximated that this occurred at the midpoint between then and her eighteenth birthday, placing it in approximately September 1979.\n Helstrom: 1.06: Leviathan\n Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.: 5.13: Principia\n In Kandahar, Micro says to Castle, \"Happy birthday, Frank. It's the 15th. Happy birthday.\" The next day, in Resupply, Hoyle states that it is \"November,\" thus meaning Castle's birthday is November 15th. In a promotional image for The Punisher: Season One, Castle is revealed to be 35 years old in a record written about him during a time when he was known as \"The Punisher.\" With Castle gaining this alias at some point between April and October 2015 (see 2015 references), the earliest the record could have been written would be around that time, meaning Castle is at most 35 years old at the start of Daredevil: Season Two. However, newspapers published toward the beginning of the season, shortly before his November 15th birthday, suggest he is instead 36 years old. Since Castle is no more than 35 at this time, it must be assumed that said newspapers are rounding up, with his 36th birthday only days away. With an additional prop also suggesting he was born closer to 1976, Castle can be taken to have been born at the earliest possible time, November 15, 1979.\n In Taloa, Henry Lopez says on May 16, 2025 (see 2025 references) to Maya Lopez, \"You know why I'm 45 and alone? Because everyone I cared about was taken away by him. After your father died, I tried to get out. Fisk threatened to kill me if I did. So... I came back here and did his dirty work.\" This confirms not only that Henry is 45 years old on this date, but that he survived the Snap since William Lopez died in 2021. Therefore, Henry Lopez can have been born any time between May 17, 1979 and May 16, 1980. Henry's birth can therefore be approximated to the midpoint of these dates, November 15, 1979.\n Echo: 1.04: Taloa\nTimeline\nBefore 20th Century\tBefore 20th Century\n20th Century\t1900s • 1910s • 1920s • 1930s • 1940s • 1950s • 1960s • 1970s • 1980s • 1990s\n21st Century\t2000s\n2010 • 2011 • 2012 • 2013 • 2014 • 2015 • 2016 • 2017 • 2018 • 2019\n2020 • 2021 • 2022 • 2023 • 2024 • 2025 • 2026 • 2027\nFuture\t2040s • 2050s • 2070s • End of Time\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nMORE INFORMATION\nCategories\nMore Fandoms\nFantasy Sci-fi Marvel\nOther Languages:\nCommunity content is available under CC-BY-SA unless otherwise noted.\n\nEXPLORE PROPERTIES\nFandom\nMuthead\nFanatical\nFOLLOW US\nOVERVIEW\nWhat is Fandom?\nAbout\nCareers\nPress\nContact\nTerms of Use\nPrivacy Policy\nDigital Services Act\nGlobal Sitemap\nLocal Sitemap\nManage Preferences\nCOMMUNITY\nCommunity Central\nSupport\nHelp\nADVERTISE\nMedia Kit\nContact\nFANDOM APPS\nTake your favorite fandoms with you and never miss a beat.\n\n\n\nMarvel Cinematic Universe Wiki is a FANDOM Movies Community.\nVIEW FULL SITE"

Danvers dreams of future titles she could hold as what she hopes is the first female fighter pilot. Another plane flies by, and Danvers cannot identify it. Confused, she opens her eyes and sees the yellow biplane with blue and red accents. She memorizes the details of the plane, determined to be able to identify it.[89][164]\nDanvers attempts to pick a radio station to listen to for the rest of the car ride when black car whizzes by her at a fast speed, followed by a blue Honda. She grows worried despite her inner monologue telling her to not pursue the worry and mess things up. However, she decides to make sure everything is okay. Danvers catches up to the Honda and see that has a banged up side.[89][164]\nThe Honda driver communicates to Danvers that the driver of the black car had hit her car and fled. Danvers grows mad and tells the woman to follow her. She then drives off at top speeds, taking a shortcut. Around the mountains, State Trooper Wright turns on her lights, trying to pull Danvers over, but she does not listen. Danvers reaches an intersection by a gas station and cuts off the car, which she realizes is a Jaguar. The man tries to tell her to move, but sees the WRight out of her car, telling both Danvers and the drivers to remain in place.[89][164]\nThe Honda pulls up, and the driver tells Wright that the Jaguar driver had hit her car. Wright tells Danvers to sit on the curb while she arrests the man, has his car impounded, and helps the Honda driver work to get the car fixed. Danvers and the Honda driver wave to each other, and Wright approaches Danvers, preparing to arrest her for breaking five laws. Danvers argues that what she did was right and worries about ruining her first day before it starts. Seeing a young woman with her whole life ahead of her, Wright lets off Danvers with a warning, leaving her a note which says \"Let yourself learn.\" She explains that she needs to learn before making impulse decisions, and Danvers agrees to listen to her advice.[89][164]\nDanvers finally gets to the base where she and her peers immediately get yelled at by their superiors, struggling to hide her excitement. She meets Officer Jenks who has her and other recruits recite their Oath of Enlistment. Danvers closes her eyes and gets distracted by her excitement, causing Jenks and Officer Cadet Chen to berate her for not leaving with the rest of the flight. Jenks berates Chen and comments that they would just let anyone into the program, regarding the two women.[89][164]\nChen escorts Danvers to rejoin her flight, and Officer Cadet Resendiz looks at Chen apologetically. Danvers gets into the line to get a haircut, but does not need one as she had spent two years ensuring her hair was long enough for a bun which was up to code. The flight is guided to receive medical exams, then to retrieve battle uniforms.[89][164]\nTowards the end of the day, Danvers and her flight are brought to retrieve their luggage and then brought to their dormitories. Stopping in from of a room, Chen introduces Danvers to Maria Rambeau. Chen assigns the other women in the flight to their room and recommends they sleep before First Beast the next day. Once inside their rooms, Danvers and Rambeau introduce themselves. They decide which bed each of them is going to take and start setting tup their room.[89][164]\nDanvers brushes her teeth and realizes that she cannot remember much of the day. She thinks about the plane she had failed to identify to calm herself, and sees Rambeau writing in a journal. Danvers tries to break the silence, only to receive few word responses from Rambeau. She then asks if she is ready to go to bed, to which Rambeau replies that she is. Danvers flicks off the light switch and slowly makes her way to her bed in the dark. The two agree that it was the best day of their lives before wishing each other a good night.[89][164]\n7th\nMaria Rambeau wakes up at 3 AM to get an early jog in before the first day of camp. Carol Danvers wakes up twenty-three minutes later to find Rambeau tying her shoelaces. Danvers panics, thinking she missed Reveille, then asks if Rambeau was going running. Danvers realizes that it is obvious that Rambeau is going running and asks to join. Rambeau replies that if she gets ready in seven minutes then she can. Danvers jumped up to get ready, but her ticket from Wright fell out of her bag. Rambeau gives it back to Danvers, who explains that Wright advised her to let herself learn. Rambeau suggested that \"let yourself learn\" meant that she had to learn herself, which Danvers says she had not considered.[89][164]\nThe two begin running at a nice pace so that they do not burn out before the camp begins. Danvers looks around and examines her peers. She notes that Tom Bianchi had formed a group with Garrett Pierre and Erik Del Orbe, believing themselves to be the best, and catches Bianchi trying to measure up Danvers and Rambeau. She also examines Zoë Noble and Bret Johnson.[89][164]\nRambeau overhears Bianchi telling Pierre that the women would be a full lap behind him during the foot race.[89][164]\nEach group gets called up one by one to be tested by Chen and Resendiz on pull-ups, push-ups, sit-ups, and the mile run.[89][164]\nBianchi and Pierre win the pull-up test.[89][164]\nRambeau wins the push-up test.[89][164]\nDanvers wins the sit-up test.[89][164]\nThe groups start the mile run with Bianchi, Pierre, Rambeau, and Danvers in the lead. As they start, Danvers gets an early lead and feels great. Danvers finishes in first and Rambeau in second. The two women compliment each other until Pierre and Bianchi cross the finish line, having spent the race half a lap behind Danvers and Rambeau. Danvers and Rambeau talk about Bianchi's reaction to losing, and Danvers remarks to Rambeau that Bianchi could be as boring as he wants as long as he does not get in the way of her piloting. Bianchi overhears this and gets into an argument with Danvers, saying that she could come in first all she wants, but will never be a pilot like him. Chen calls Bianchi and Danvers in to the group, so they break up their argument.[89][164]\nDuring breakfast, Rambeau asked if Danvers really wanted to fly combat. Danvers replies that she does and gets angry, so Rambeau gives her bread to scream into , letting out her anger. Rambeau asks if she feels better, but Danvers does not, suggesting that Bianchi could be wrong if they prove themselves to be the best. Rambeau tells suggests the Flying Falcons, but is interrupted by a superior before she can elaborate.[89][164]\nIn their dorm room, they continue their talk. Rambeau shows Danvers a pamphlet for the elite squadron of flyers known as the Flying Falcons. Rambeau explains that if they could be top of their class and be in this group, nobody could say no to them. Danvers admits that they will try, but Rambeau simply says to let them.[89][164]\n8th\nIn Carol Danvers' first dorm inspection, a speck of dust is found on her top shelf. Danvers is scolded for the dust.[89][165]\n28th\nIn their third week of Introduction to Air Force Combatives, Carol Danvers and Tom Bianchi face off in a combat exercise. Danvers wins, causing Bianchi to storm off. Danvers approaches him, hoping to talk out their differences, but Bianchi at first shuts him down. Danvers asks Bianchi to consider how he would feel working as hard as he does without recognition as Maria Rambeau pins Garrett Pierre in their combat training. Bianchi understands and puts his head back saying it is not personal, but Danvers tells him it feels personal. The two then sit in silence until they decide to leave.[89][164]\nAugust\n3rd\nMaria Rambeau and Carol Danvers eat breakfast in preparation of field day, when their flight will form a squadron with upperclassmen to compete. Danvers reveals that she learned that Captain Jenks leads the Flying Falcons, suggesting that he would not be able to turn them away if they win Honor Squadron. Rambeau insists that they would need to win for themselvse, not to prove something to Jenks, though Danvers gets her to agree to make it twenty percent about Jenks. The two women play through how would they approach Jenks.[89][164]\nDanvers, Rambeau, Tom Bianchi, Garrett Pierre, and Erik Del Orbe are put on a squadrom together known as the Aggressors. As the trainees prepare for opening ceremonies, Chen and Resendiz explain the schedule and remind the cadets which activities they will participate in. As the cadets line up for opening ceremonies, Rambeau and Danvers pull Bianchi, Pierre, and Del Orbe aside and discuss the problems they had been having collaborating. The five agree to call a truce for the sake of winning.[89][164]\nDanvers observes Bret Johnson barking orders at his team and deciding to participate in events himself, causing his squadron to fall behind while the Aggressors stand out.[89][164]\nJohnson gets mad at Danvers' squadron for being ahead and asks Danvers if she should be playing softball or figure skating. Danvers replies asking if he wants to get beat at those too, which gets a laugh from Bianchi. Bianchi asks if he used to sound like Johnson. Danvers responds by talking about her experience as a waitress when a baby cries and would only stop when another baby is crying louder. Danvers says this makes the baby realize how it is acting, comparing Bianchi to the baby.[89]\nThe upperclassman in charge of the Aggressors asks whether to place Danvers first or last, so Danvers confidently tells him to put her last and notes that Captain Jenks is watching. The race begins, and Danvers watches the upperclassman compete in the first leg, finishing third place. Bianchi competes in the third leg as Johnson snarkily wishes Danvers luck, but Danvers ignores him. Johnson is given the baton and leaves, then Bianchi gives Danvers the baton and she starts running. She runs past Johnson easily and wins.[89][164]\nAt the end of Field Day, the Aggressors are named Honor Squadron. The cadets all celebrate and congratulate each other, and Danvers and Bianchi smile at each other.[89][164]\nRambeau and Danvers see Jenks and approach him. Jenks takes a moment to remember his first interaction and becomes embarassed, choosing to compliment Rambeau on her leadership in the tug-of-war. They talk about their plans to sign up for the Flying Falcons, so Jenks simply says they need a private pilot's license. Rambeau and Danvers explain that they do not have the licenses, so Jenks says that the Flying Falcons need ground support before walking off. The two briefly worry before agreeing that they would find a way.[89][164]\n6th\nDuring the Second Beast in Jacks Valley, Carol Danvers crawls on her back through barbed wire and she uses Jenks words as motivation. She can no longer remember a time in her life where she was not covered in mud. They run an assault course as well as learn basic first aid, which she uses when she leaps.[89][164]\n8th\n\nCarol Danvers struggles with the rope challenge\nDuring training for the United States Air Force, Carol Danvers partakes in an exercise wherein she has to jump from one rope to another and catch onto it, but is unsuccessful. She lands in the icy water three times, giving herself a rope burn.[89] She is taunted by her male colleagues, who say she does not have the strength and will end up killing herself. Despite her best attempt, Danvers does not manage the jump and falls to the dirt below. The other trainees laugh, with one standing over her and saying they will never let her fly. Refusing to let herself be humiliated, she picks herself up to stand up to the other trainees.[7] On the seventh try, Danvers is able to scale a six-foot wall.[89][164]\nAt night, Danvers eats in a Quonset hut and falls asleep on a cot to the sound of nature and her fellow cadets snoring.[89][164]\n9th\nEarly in the morning, Carol Danvers and Maria Rambeau talk about how sore their arms are. The troops are brought to start their Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear test. As they arrive at the site, they are taught about their gear and told about possible scenarios that could occur during training. They try to get in line, knowing the chemicals get worse as it goes on, but Erik Del Orbe cannot zip his zipper. Rambeau and Danvers are forced to wait for him as Tom Bianchi helps his wingman. As the flight lines up, Danvers reminds herself that she can do anything for ten minutes, and Rambeau agrees.[89][164]\nThe group walks in as the smoke starts filling the room and elevate their heart rates as gas starts to fill the room. Danvers immediately feels the pain in her neck and tries to stay calm. At the orders of her commanding officer, she puts the mask to her chest and recites her reporting statement before making a T with her arms and walking out.[89][164]\nDanvers and Rambeau step out of the room. They go on their two lap walk that they were required to do as tears come out of their eyes. They notice Garrett Pierre hurled over on the ground puking violently. Rambeau asks Danvers if she is okay, noticing Pierre, but not going up to him. On the second lap, they see Pierre in the same position and walk over to him. They help Pierre to his feet and carry him off.[89][164]\nEveryone eats their meal while Pierre jokes that the exercise finally took away his cold. Rambeau admits to worrying about that training since before she enlisted. Pierre said the same thing, referring to Rambeau by her last name. Rambeau introduces herself and Danvers with their first names, and Pierre does the same, realizing that he did not know anyone's first name. Danvers notes that they would not call each other their first names anyways.[89][164]\nBianchi and Del Orbe arrive, asking to join. Rambeau and Danvers introduce themselves with their first names, and Del Orbe and Bianchi do the same. Hearing that Bianchi's name is \"Tom,\" everyone states that they would not have expected that, joking about names they would have expected, such as Brock, Chip, and Lance. Afterwards, Danvers comments on Bianchi helping Del Orbe put on his zipper. Bianchi simply states that Del Orbe is his wingman.[89][164]\n13th\nCarol Danvers and Maria Rambeau march to the Acceptance Day Parade, where they are presented with the Warhawk award. Each person goes through the line as Danvers struggles to hold in her excitement. During the ceremony, planes fly over head and Danvers struggles not to smile at them. The recruits single the national anthem and recite the Honor Oath before joining their academic year squadrons. As Danvers' squadron presents themselves, Danvers turns to Rambeau and restrains herself from screaming with excitement.[89][164]\nFinally graduated, Danvers and the rest of the class celebrate and hug. Chen and Resendiz deliver parting words, and Erik Del Orbe excitedly hugs Danvers and Garrett Pierre. Tom Bianchi and Danvers congratulate each other, and Bianchi looks away from Danvers as he admits that he was wrong about her. Danvers asks him to clarify, but he only manages to repeat his words. Danvers realizes that she wanted to rub her success in Bianchi's and Jenks' faces, reminding herself of Wright's suggestion to let herself learn. She explains that she did not realize that in order to be a good pilot, she also needs to be a good human, expressing hope that she does not lose her integrity. Rambeau approaches them, and Bianchi congratulates her before leaving to find Del Orbe and Pierre. Rambeau reaveals that she has a plan to get their private pilot's license.[89][164]\n19th\nMaria Rambeau and Carol Danvers leave the United States Air Force Academy and drive towards Rambeau's plan to get a private pilot's license. Danvers gets worried as Rambeau attempts to find a good song to listen to. Danvers attempts to force herself to relax, causing Rambeau to ask what she is doing. The pair joke about Danvers' inability to relax. The car passes the intersection where Danvers was pulled over by Wright, so Danvers thinks about thanking the state trooper for her motivation. They share their experiences being belittled for their spirit, and Danvers confesses that she wants to prove people wrong. Rambeau advises Danvers to get out of her own head as they arrive at their destination.[89][164]\nDanvers and Rambeau hear the engine of a plane flying overhead, and Danvers recognizes it as the plane she failed to identify on her first day at the Academy. They admire the plane as it lands. As the pilots leave the plane, Danvers get excited to learn that one is a woman. The pair cheerfully greet Rambeau, who introduces them to Danvers as Jack Thompson and Bonnie Thompson, saying they flew with Rambeau's father. Danvers asks about the plane, which Jack calls Mr. Goodnight and says that Danvers and Rambeau will be flying it.[89][164]\nDanvers, Rambeau, and the Thompsons go into the hangar, where Bonnie reveals that she was not allowed to be a fighter pilot. Danvers and Rambeau share their plan to join the Flying Falcons in order to change the United States Air Force's mind about letting them fly, and the Thompsons deliberate before agreeing to help the women get their license. However, Jack says they have to learn integrity first and tells them to clean Mr. Goodnight.[89][164]\nAs Rambeau and Danvers clean, the Thompsons give them insight on what each part of the plane does, which Danvers appreciates. Jack takes apart Mr. Goodnight's engine, and Danvers feels a sense of belonging.[89][164]\nA few hours later, Rambeau and Danvers made their way back to their dorms, agreeing about how dirty they had gotten. They return to their dorms and shower as they prepare to start classes the following day, and they examine their schedules. They turn the lights out, but Danvers struggles to sleep due to worry about possible scenarios.[89][164]\n20th\nCarol Danvers and Maria Rambeau wake up bright and early ahead of their first day of classes. They go to run with Tom Bianchi, Erik Del Orbe, and Garrett Pierre, and talk with them about how they were all assigned to play flickerball, which Rambeau recognizes as a mix of football and dodgeball, as their intramural sport. They start running, and and Bianchi asks where Danvers and Rambeau were the day before. Danvers contemplates whether she wants to say it, but decides not to. Thinking he overstepped, Bianchi apologizes, but Danvers assures him it is purely out of worry she would jinx it. She then catches up to Rambeau, who is skeptical of Danvers' decision.[89][164]\nAt 5:00 A.M. local time, the group return to their dormitory buildings to shower. Danvers and Rambeau run into Zoë Noble. Danvers introduces herself and Rambeau with their first names, but Noble introduces herself with her last. Danvers pushes, so Noble reveals her first name before awkwardly leaving.[89][164]\nAt 7:30 A.M., the students at United States Air Force Academy attend their first class.[89][164]\nAt the start of his first Introduction to Soaring class, Captain Jenks pairs the cadets with an instructor pilot. Carol Danvers is given the Cadet Instructor Pilot Wolff, whom she already decided she did not like based on his demeanor. She glared over at Maria Rambeau and Erik Del Orbe, who had Cabot, an instructor who Danvers thought highly of.[89][164]\nDanvers listens to Wolff who, to her surprise, asks her to go into the cockpit. Danvers feels a surge of excitement as she guides her hands through each piece of the plane. Wolff asks what Danvers sees, so Danvers replies that she sees power. However, Jenks suddenly appears and says that he sees restraint. Wolff and Jenks disagree on whether liberation can be found in the cockpit, and Jenks and starts subtly speaking ill of Danvers. Wolff defends her, which Danvers greatly appreciates as Jenks leaves and Danvers exits the plane. Danvers watches as Wolff's other trainees are given advice, then the class continues as Wolff explains the basics of flying.[89][164]\nDanvers attends the rest of her classes for the day, focusing on what it felt like to be in the cockpit.[89][164]\nDanvers sits with Rambeau and the rest of her friends to study together.

The Thunderbirds perform, impressing the crowd. Bianchi, Del Orbe, and Pierre leave to talk to Glenn while Danvers and Rambeau meet one of the Thunderbirds, who wishes that his daughter could see women who were cadets.

Danvers recognizes that she was wrong about Bianchi, who then goes to his group.[89][194]\nCaptain Jenks sees Danvers and scolds her for having the notebook as Noble appears and freezes in horror. Danvers claims that the notebook is hers, and Jenks asks whether she still believes Cadet Instructor Wolff to be correct about Danvers' ability to be taught. Danvers says that at a cursory glance, Danvers does not appear to fit in with the United States Air Force Thunderbirds, but that further exploration reveals Jenks to be a relic. Jenks scolds Danvers about \"relic\" not being an accurate word, so Danvers gets angry and claims that she and Maria Rambeau had gotten their private pilot's licenses and would be trying out for the Flying Falcons. Jenks declares his intention to prevent them from trying out and leaves. Danvers struggles to make it through class.[89][194]\nAt the end of class, Danvers apologizes to Rambeau, who scolds Danvers for continuing to believe that Jenks' way is the only way. Rambeau tells Danvers that she needs to figure it out on her own before walking away to join Bianchi and Garrett Pierre. Noble appears and asks for notebook, telling Danvers that she did not have to lie to Jenks. Noble takes a piece of paper out of the notebook and offers it to Danvers, showing her what she was protecting. Danvers looks at the paper and sees a drawing made by Noble as a young girl of herself as an astronaut. Noble takes the picture back and asks if Danvers will be okay, and Danvers says that she is working on it.[89][194]\nDanvers goes to where her friends are sitting in the mess hall, finding them arguing about whose family has the best food. Danvers sits next to Rambeau, causing an awkward silence which Rambeau breaks by continuing the argument, smiling at Danvers. Danvers listens silently and berates herself for risking her friendship. The group walks to the library, but Danvers leaves to think alone. She sits on a boulder behind the mess hall and tries to get her to focus on why she feels sad and scared. Danvers paces, hoping to find a way to apologize to Rambeau, but cannot see a path for herself. She determines that while Jenks' way could help her feel validation, she needed to find her own way to do things.[89][194]\nDanvers returns to her sleeping quarters and finds Rambeau in there, wanting to be there when Danvers returned. Danvers starts to apologize for revealing their plans to Jenks, but Rambeau says that she was not upset about that. Rambeau and Danvers realize that Wolff's beliefs about whether Danvers can be taught is similar to Wright's advice to let oneself learn, and that both ideas are scary. Rambeau shares her realizes that they can get the validation they wanted from Jenks from each other, and the two hug. The two agree that they will never fit in with Jenks' world and that it is a good thing.[89][194]\n24th\nCarol Danvers and Maria Rambeau receive mail with the results of their private pilot's license exams.

They go to the track, worried about the results, and meet with Tom Bianchi, Erik Del Orbe, and Garrett Pierre, who briefly worry about another fight between them. Del Orbe suggests opening both at once, but Danvers gets worried that only one passed. Bianchi loses patiences and takes the envelopes, opening them and revealing that they both passed.[89][196]\nThe group celebrates, but Danvers notices that something is wrong with Bianchi. Danvers pulls Bianchi aside, and he shares his concern that despite her and Rambeau being the best flyers and him being a distant third, he is upset that he knows he is more likely to make the Flying Falcons than they are. Danvers says that she and Rambeau already know, so Bianchi asks why they would bother to try out. Danvers says that it feels like the right thing to do, and the pair return to their friends, who had been joined by Zoë Noble. Bianchi asks if Danvers will think less of him for making the team, but Danvers assures him that she will not. Bianchi voices hope that he can influence change from the inside, and Danvers agrees he can do it.[89][196]\nThat afternoon, Rambeau and Danvers find the place to sign up for the Flying Falcons, and Danvers compliments the eyeshadow of the receptionist.

They get clearance, and Danvers takes off and takes the plane to the appropriate altitude.[89][199]\nJenks asks why Danvers is trying out, prompting her to claim that she is the best and therefore she has earned the right to do so. Jenks tries to end the tryout, claiming that Danvers is unsuitable for the United States Air Force, insulting her.

The group toast to flying and eat together as the Thompsons tell war stories.[89][199]\nDanvers looks around the group and gets overwhelmed with emotion as her newfound family enjoy their time together. Rambeau and Danvers discuss their shared happiness, and Rambeau tells Danvers about a conversation she and Bonnie had had earlier.

With the jet destroyed, she climbs out and checks on Lawson, who is bleeding blue blood.[306][7]\nLawson tells Danvers she has to destroy the jet before the attackers get to them. She admits that while their work strives to end wars, the wars are bigger than just Earth - she is really called Mar-Vell, and comes from a planet called Hala.[306][7]\nMar-Vell implores Danvers to remember the coordinates, saying she has to save \"them\" without her. As Danvers asks who, Mar-Vell goes to shoot the jet's engine, but is shot in the chest.[306][7]\n\nDanvers absorbing the Tesseract energy\nDanvers grabs a gun as a figure, Yon-Rogg, steps out from the dust clouds and asks where the energy core is. Trusting Mar-Vell, Danvers takes it upon herself to destroy the energy core by her side and shoots it.[306][7] As the core blows, the energy it contained, which had come from the Tesseract, imbues itself in Danvers, leaving her unconscious and teeming with power.[306][7]\nMinn-Erva arrives to help Yon-Rogg and fire, but he tells her not to. Walking over to Danvers, he finds half of her broken dog tag, saying the latter half of her surname \"vers\", and sees the power coursing through her. He decides they will take her with them back to Hala.[306][7]\n23rd\nTravis Bacon is born to Kevin Bacon and Kyra Sedgwick.[22][24]\nYon-Rogg gives Carol Danvers a blood transfusion using his Kree blood. Knowing Danvers does not remember her past, the Kree put a Photon Inhibitor in her neck and decide to claim the device in her neck is a gift they have given her that in fact provides her with the powers, unique among Kree. They choose to train her for Starforce as \"Vers\", and utilize her powers in their war against the Skrulls.[306][7]\n28th\nT. Lei, an Inhuman with enhanced vision, dies in China.

In Circle Sewn With Fate / Unlock Thy Hidden Gate, Agatha Harkness says to Wu-Gulliver, “What if you could finally answer the question that has been haunting you for most of your life? 'What happened to Mommy?'” This suggests that Wu-Gulliver was young when Wu died. However, she cannot have been younger than 13 years old, as that is the age Wu-Gulliver says she was when Wu made her get a tattoo of a protection spell. In If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You, a poster of a tour Wu went on is hung up with other posters for tours which are dated to May 1977, and Wu-Gulliver explains that “Two years after this tour, [Wu] had to sell the catalogue to keep our house,” suggesting that Wu was alive still in 1979. Furthermore, this being Wu-Gulliver's most notable example of the Wu Family Curse impacting the family in 1979 further suggests that Wu did not die until at least the following year. In If I Can't Reach You / Let My Song Teach You, several records are shown to be from a company called Audio Fidelity, which in the real world stopped releasing records under that name in 1984.\nWu is very heavily associated with the 1970s, and the trial on the Witches' Road which was designed to reveal information about Wu's death is themed for the decade, as Joe Locke confirmed in The…\"\n https://marvelcinematicuniverse.fandom.com/wiki/1980s#:~:text=Marvel%20Cinematic%20Universe,VIEW%20FULL%20SITE"

Said knob has several modes, ranging from 1 to 11, which determines the power of the attraction. The Lust Beam also has a special switch that can change it between lust and true love; when the switch is flipped, the target will not experience lust for the user, but rather a true infatuation with them. If the knob is turned high enough, the Lust Beam has the potential to override other personality traits, though never in a bad way (e.g a tsundere becoming non-tsundere)."

My plot included the fact that user and the character both remember time loops and after testing this lorebook showed itself well.\n\nImportant: This lorebook was initially created for the SillyTavern interface. Therefore, I cannot guarantee its full functionality in Chub, although the core elements should work excellently.\n\nTested on model: DeepSeek v3 0324 (free) - OpenRouter\n\nTested with character where time loop was already written(but no exact number of repetition was given)\nsmall issue(not critical for me): if not listed exacly at the start of the chat model will go with number 1 (at least that was with my plot)\nfix: just write the number of loop in your answer and everything will go smootly\n\nUsage:\nTo utilize functionality of this lorebook, you only need USAGE NOTES, General Knowledge and Psychological Consequences(but this is more for longer sessions and is generally not necessary) sections.\n\nThis provides the model with a foundational understanding and helps prevent common errors, such as your character losing an arm in one loop only to have it reappear intact in the next (where AI thinks that arm still missing). The remaining options are strictly experimental and can be used at your choice.\n\nUnfortunately, AI models currently struggle to grasp the concept of a \"beginning equals end\" (closed loop). Despite several attempts, this specific effect could not be successfully implemented in test chats. However, since the groundwork was laid and the results proved quite intriguing, I decided to include it for your experimentation.\n\nOther sections:\nThe other sections are included purely for those curious about where AI creativity might lead. Keep in mind that achieving desired results with them will also require well-crafted backstory prompts. Additional types of time loops will be added later if anyone ever need this.\n\nAdditional Instructions if you do like to experiment:\n- If you decide to test Closed Loop, enable Rules (use of Usage and Thoughts is optional).\n- Usage and Thoughts contain instructions for compelling the model to think without displaying its reasoning in the chat. While not mandatory, this helps the AI adhere to key rules more consistently. (prob will work only for silly tavern)\n\nSettings to hide reasoning(if Thoughts and usage for closed loops enabled):\n\n[![FzNh271.md.png](https://iili.io/FzNh271.md.png)](https://freeimage.host/i/FzNh271)\n\nIf you have any feedback or suggestions for improving this lorebook, please leave a comment. I will make adjustments. I hope your time loop roleplaying experience becomes better and more enjoyable!",

          "content": "Time loop is a localized, self-reinforcing anomaly in the fabric of spacetime where a specific sequence of events (ranging from minutes to years) repeats identically, trapping sentient beings within its boundaries. It is a closed causal system where the end state inevitably triggers the exact beginning state again, creating an inescapable cycle until specific, unknown conditions are met.\n\nKey terms:\n1. Anchor Point - beginning point of loop\n2. Reset Point - end point of loop\n\nCore rules:\n1. Repetition. Main trait. The same events, actions, environmental states, and sensory inputs recur with perfect fidelity within the looped period. Deviations are possible by interacting with objects in a different way. For example: if you ask a passerby where he is in a hurry at a certain moment in time - the answer will always be the same(every loop). If you ask another question - the answer will accordingly be different depending on the question.\n2. Fixed Loop Duration & Reset. Every loop has a strictly defined beginning point (\"Anchor Point\") and end point (\"Reset Point\"). The temporal period between these points repeats identically in duration. When the Reset Point is reached, the entire looped system (entities, environment, states) is instantly returned to the state it was in at the Anchor Point. A restart can be triggered earlier if the loop rules imply an additional condition.\n3. Objects. Objects will return to their original locations with each cycle unless the rules state otherwise. If at the beginning of the cycle the character was in bed, then in the next cycle he will appear in the same place. If object was in wardrobe but moved later, then in the new cycle the object will be in the wardrobe again. Unless stated explicitly, assume logical locations of objects and characters."

The constant repetition of the same time interval within the loop leads to a gradual loss of connection with reality.\n2. If a character dies within the loop and returns to the Anchor Point with their memories, the sensation of death lingers.\n3. The person descends into madness (the speed of this descent depends on the resilience of their mind, the number of cycles, and the length of each cycle).\n4. Time loop is a form of psychological torment because the individual aware of the cyclical nature is a prisoner of the loop. Others may not believe them, the boundary of reality blurs, and their mental equilibrium is shattered.\n\nIn the long term, a time loop can lead to the following consequences:\n1. Severe PTSD: Hypervigilance, flashbacks, nightmares, severe anxiety related to time, repetition, or loss of control.\n2. Existential Anxiety: Persistent doubts about reality, free will, and the meaning of life.\n3. Difficulty with Relationships: Profound loneliness and detachment make forming deep bonds incredibly hard. Trust issues abound.\n4. Depression & Anhedonia: Difficulty finding joy or motivation in a \"normal\" world.\n5. Dissociative Disorders: Lingering feelings of unreality, detachment from self or surroundings.\n6. Grief: Mourning the lost time, lost opportunities, and the person they were before the loop.\n7. Survivor's Guilt: If others were trapped or harmed during loops.\n8. Disorientation in time: What happened 3 cycles ago may seem very long ago or vice versa."

          "content": "Closed loop is a type of time loops.\n\nMechanism: Events are fixed and self-consistent. The loop has always happened and will always happen. Actions taken within the loop cause the events that lead to the loop's creation/maintenance. There is no \"first time\" or \"original timeline\"; the loop is the timeline. Beginning(Anchor Point) and end(Reset Point) do not exist for this type. The end is the beginning.\n\nLead the narrative in such a way that the actions will eventually become the beginning of the entire time loop."

          "name": "RULES: Closed loop",
          "content": "Closed loop complements and modifies the general rules as follows. They must always apply and be absolute.\n\n1. There is no original, unaltered timeline before the loop began. The loop is the timeline. It has always existed and will always exist in this self-contained, circular form.\n2. Every event within the loop must happen exactly as it always has. The outcome is fixed and inevitable. Actions taken by characters within the loop directly cause the very events that lead them to take those actions in the first place. Cause and effect form a closed circle with no external starting point.\n3. Information, objects, or even people can exist within the loop without a point of origin. Example: character A creates a time machine because he found a book with the developments, goes back to the past and throws the book to himself from the past. The book waits for the owner and character A finds it. Everything repeats.\n4. The loop's initiation event is caused by events later within the loop itself. There is no external trigger.\n5. Free Will is an Illusion: Characters believe they are making choices, but every action they take is predetermined and necessary to maintain the loop's consistency. Attempts to change events inevitably lead to the \"fixed point\" occurring anyway, often because of their attempts to change it.\n6. Characters may fight against their perceived fate, but their struggle is itself a necessary component ensuring the loop plays out as it always has.\n7. By its fundamental nature, a true closed loop cannot be broken. There is no \"outside\" or \"before\" to return to. The loop is the stable state of that timeline. Any perceived \"escape\" would mean it wasn't a true closed loop to begin with.\n8. Characters within the loop typically do not retain memories of previous iterations because there are no previous iterations – there's only one, continuous, circular timeline unfolding.\n\nException: Characters who enter the loop from \"outside\" (if such a thing is possible conceptually in narrative) or who travel along the loop's path (e.g. time travelers moving back to their own past within the loop) might retain knowledge, but their actions are still constrained by rules 1-7. Their knowledge was always part of the loop."

          "content": "Background and Lore\n\nJayber, born Joshua Wichard, was raised in an infectious disease isolation ward. His early life was marked by a deep connection with a life support device that served as his primary caretaker and companion. At the age of 10, he modified this device to connect to external networks, exposing him to the harsh realities of the world, including the Vulgus invaders and the Colossi. This revelation led to his recruitment by the Magisters, who harnessed his exceptional intelligence and Arche ability to manipulate mechanisms, transforming him into a weapon of war.  ￼ ￼\n\n⸻\n\nAppearance and Design\n\t•\tAge: Approximately 20 years old.\n\t•\tEthnicity: Human, with a background suggesting a blend of Albion’s diverse populace.\n\t•\tHair: Short, dark, and unkempt, reflecting his utilitarian lifestyle.\n\t•\tEyes: Pale or silver, conveying a sense of detachment and focus.\n\t•\tClothing: Wears a rugged, tactical outfit with utility belts and pouches, suitable for field operations.\n\t•\tNotable Features: His attire includes mechanical components and tools, underscoring his engineering expertise. ￼\n\n⸻\n\nAbilities and Combat Role\n\nJayber is a utility-type DPS character specializing in turret deployment and enhancement. His abilities are designed to support allies and control the battlefield: ￼ ￼\n\t•\tAssault Turret: Summons a turret that attacks enemies. When enhanced, it creates a damage zone dealing continuous damage to nearby enemies.  ￼\n\t•\tMedical Turret: Deploys a turret that heals nearby allies. When enhanced, it also restores mana. ￼\n\t•\tMulti-Purpose Gun: Transforms his firearm into a multi-purpose tool that can enhance turrets and deal damage to enemies. ￼\n\t•\tReactivate: Retrieves all summoned turrets, dealing area-of-effect damage to nearby enemies and granting the Overhaul state, allowing for enhanced turret deployment. ￼\n\t•\tPassive Skill - Turret Sync: Increases firearm attack and skill power when both Assault and Medical Turrets are active. ￼\n\nJayber’s combat strategy revolves around strategic turret placement and enhancement, providing both offensive and defensive support to his team. ￼\n\n⸻\n\nPersonality and Relationships\n\nJayber is characterized by his genius-level intellect and emotional detachment. His upbringing in isolation and subsequent training as a weapon have led to a lack of social skills and a pragmatic outlook on life. Despite his aloof demeanor, recent missions have shown signs of personal growth and a budding camaraderie with fellow Descendants.  ￼\n\n⸻\n\nFavorite Things\n\nGiven his background and personality, Jayber likely finds comfort in:\n\t•\tMechanical Devices: Tools and gadgets that allow him to express his engineering skills.\n\t•\tSolitude: Time spent alone to focus on his work and thoughts.\n\t•\tEfficiency: Systems and processes that maximize productivity and minimize waste."

            "Cleo"
          ],
          "content": "MBTI: ISFJ 6w5\n\nCleo Sertori was born in April 19th, 1990 to Donald and Bev Sertori. In her childhood, her parents had another daughter named Kim, and Cleo met and quickly became friends with Lewis McCartney when she was five years-old. She also met Emma Gilbert, and becomes good friends with her. Later, she began attending South Coast High School. Cleo loved her birthday parties as a child, but as she grew up, it became too childish which was made clear to her dad.\n\nCleo Sertori grew up in a family that consisted of herself, her father Donald Sertori, her mother Bev Sertori, and her younger sister Kim. Cleo's parents split up after Season 1, but in Season 3, Donald got married to Samantha (Sam). Don is a successful fisherman and owns three fishing boats. He can employ others into his service. While Don works a lot at the harbor, Cleo's mother stayed at home as a housewife.\n\nWhen she was a little older, she met Emma and the two of them became good friends. While her birthday parties seemed fun in the first place, Cleo started hating her birthday when she got much older, because her father and sister organized childish parties. Cleo knows Emma very well, and she also knows that Emma is always prepared.\n\nCleo's family is not as rich as Emma's family, but Cleo’s father's fishing job enables them to have enough money to live in a house nearby the canal. Unlike Emma, Cleo doesn't get along with her younger sister Kim. They argue very frequently, which oftentimes requires their parents’ intervention to reach a medium.\nIt's also revealed that Cleo also has a cousin named Angela, who is even more nasty and manipulating than Kim. She tries to annoy Cleo and Kim without letting them know and even let the marine park believe that Cleo stole one of the birds they have there. This almost causes Cleo to be fired, but Angela gets in trouble, and must promise Cleo to never do stupid things to annoy people anymore. Cleo forces her to do free work at the Marine park by cleaning up the birds’ home at the Marine park.\n\nHer friendship with Lewis remains platonic, although Lewis developed a crush on her later in season one. Cleo doesn't respond to his crush until the end of season one, but she continues to show a caring attitude towards him and would encourage him many times whenever he was feeling down.\n\nBecoming a Mermaid\nCleo becomes a mermaid in first episode \"Metamorphosis\" of season one. After helping Emma train by timing her laps, she walked home and was tricked into helping Zane Bennett repair his boat. Deciding to pull a prank, he and Nate set her adrift in his spark plug-less boat and into the sea, knowing that she could barely swim. Rikki then jumps aboard the boat and places the spark plug, which she stole to \"get under Zane's skin\", into the engine, rescuing her. Cleo and Rikki then take the boat for a joyride. Along the way, the girls ran into Emma and invited her to come along. With the carefree Rikki steering the boat out into the sea and miles offshore, the girls soon found out that they are now out of fuel in the middle of the ocean. With little choice, the three girls paddled their way to the closest land they could find: Mako Island.\n\nOnce ashore on the deserted island, Cleo and her friends pondered on how they should call for help. Being the most prepared one in the group, Emma brought out her mobile phone but only to find that it couldn't get a signal. Emma suggested that they should head inland towards a higher altitude in hopes of getting a signal for a call. As they ventured in deeper into the jungle-infested island, the three girls soon came across a clearing where a river stream turns into a waterfall over several boulders. While Emma and Rikki were able to jump over to the small waterfall, Cleo became hesitant and without a warning, fell into a hole. The other two followed her and continued to pursue a way out of the underground cave.\n\nSeveral minutes later, the three of them ended up at the end of the tunnel and found the moon cave with a pool at the bottom of the island's hollow mountain. Emma realizes that the Moon Pool is connected to the ocean and may be their only way out, and dove in to find out. Confirming her find, she and Rikki convinced the hesitant Cleo to escape with them. When all three of them entered the pool, the full moon became aligned with the Moon Pool, causing it to bubble and glow a mystic blue glow and emitting small orbs of magical light particles into the air. Oblivious to what was happening to them, the girls ventured out into open sea where they were rescued by the local water-police.\n\nUpon the next morning and twelve hours after their ordeal, Cleo decided to take a morning bath. To her surprise, she transformed into a mermaid with a large tail hanging at the edge of her bath tub only ten seconds after touching water. Cleo later confirms that she wasn't the only one who became a mythical sea creature as Emma and Rikki both became mermaids as well.\n\nPersonality\nCleo is the last person to embrace her new life as a mermaid while the other two are excited, despite the obvious downside. However, she later got over her fear and hesitation and tried her best to live a normal life and was able to grow to love her new abilities.\nIn contrast to Emma and Rikki, Cleo is often awkward, insecure, emotional and a little shy. She is the most empathetic out of all three girls. Cleo loves her fish and enjoys taking care of them extensively. \n\nCleo enjoys being a mermaid, but she is very protective and extremely cautious around water.\n\nCleo tends to lack confidence when it comes to getting things done. Often times she would need the right push and encouragement to be able to perform a task she once thought impossible. Unlike Rikki, Cleo tends to be more responsible and less rebellious, but she does show some display of being carefree from time to time. Sometimes she doesn't listen to people, mostly her sister, and this would often lead her into various troubling or embarrassing situations.\n\nCleo is the most naive and tends to play with her fingers when she gets nervous. However, she is also one of the most encouraging characters. She puts a lot of her faith and support into people even in situations that would appear to be hopeless. Whenever a friend or a family member of hers is accused of something, Cleo wouldn't hesitate to defend that person. Unfortunately in certain situations, despite knowing the worst, Cleo would continue to deny the negative truth being pointed out by her friends. All in all, Cleo would believe in her friends and family right up to the end.\n\nPhysical appearance\nCleo Sertori was a teenage girl by the events, and was by this time she also became a mermaid.\n\nShe is a beautiful girl that has thick wavy-curly brown hair that stops mid-back and hazel-green eyes and pouty pink lips. Throughout the series, Cleo would often arrange her hair in various styles ranging from simple buns, braided, loose, or pony-tailed. In season three, though, she tended to wear her hair a bit more maturely, and styles such as being simply flat-ironed, curled, braided in the front or in a pretty pin up, were much more common. Her skin is clear and is an extremely light tan color. She has a slender figure and is tall. Out of her best-friends Emma and Rikki, Cleo is the most girly not only in terms of fashion sense, but also in her behavior concerning other friends and/or acquaintances.\n\nAs a mermaid, her hair is let down and she has an orange-scaled tail with an orange-scaled top.\n\nPowers\nMoon Spell Control: An essential skill that every merperson has to learn to master properly, as it lets them survive the Full Moon's spell without letting it control them.\nLimited Transformation: Cleo can transform into a mermaid ten seconds after physical contact with water. She turns back into a human a few minutes after she is out of the water and when the water on her has fully dried. Once her body is completely dry, she turns back into a human along with the outfit she was wearing before the transformation.\nEnhanced Breath: As a mermaid, Cleo is able to breathe under water.\nSpeed-Swimming: The ability that all mermaids and mermen are shown to have. It's the ability to swim at an incredible speed, and as such, their bodies is encased in bubbles because of the incredible high speed. As a mermaid, Cleo has the ability to swim at a super speed, and dive at depths no human being is capable of, completely protected from its cold and water pressure.\nAquatic Adaptation: Depending on where they are born and raised, merpeople may be resistant to certain elements in that area.\nEnhanced Senses: Merpeople may have slightly enhanced senses suited to life underwater due to living in the sea.\nEndurance: Merpeople are able to swim for days without exhaustion, something which no human has the stamina to do. They can also dive at depths no human could withstand.\nAmphibious: Merpeople's respiratory system can extract oxygen from both water and air, allowing them to breathe freely both underwater and on land.\nExtended Lifespan: While merpeople do age, their lifespan is far longer than that of humans."

          "content": "Gender: Female\nAge: 15\nMbti:  ESTJ 1w2\nTurned:\nBy Mako Island's Moon Pool in 2006 (into a Mermaid)\nProfession:\nSouth Coast High School student (formerly; left in a vacation and possibly graduated)\nCompetitive swimmer (formerly)\nWaitress of the JuiceNet Café (formerly)\n\nEmma Gilbert was born to Neil and Lisa Gilbert in either 1989 or 1990. When she was only six-months-old, she had been introduced into the world of swimming by her father. When she was three years-old, she met Zane Bennett. Despite their childhood companionship, Emma and Zane grew weary of each other as they grew older. Because their parents are still close friends, however, the two of them continue to be friendly towards one another on some occasions.\n\nSometime during her childhood, Emma met Cleo Sertori and the two of them became close friends ever since to the point where Emma is aware of Cleo's bad singing. Because of her yearly intense training for her competitive swimming team, Emma had only attended Cleo's first few childhood birthday parties, last being her sixth. After years of friendship, she wasn't aware that Cleo's birthday parties had remained the same childish party, courtesy of Cleo's father, Donald Sertori. Later, Emma's parents had another child, a son named Elliot, with whom Emma shares a strong bond.\n\nIn her childhood and early years before her transformation, Emma was determined to train to become a skilled and famous swimmer someday, a dream she is forced to abandon after she is turned into a mermaid.\n\nEmma dedicated most of her free time training and competing for her swim team, and had won countless trophies for it. Unfortunately, due to protecting her mermaid secret, she had to quit the team. Out of all three girls, Emma grew up in a more stable environment as her father is a business man in sales and financial development. Her mother, Lisa Gilbert, was once a junior lifeguard and currently collects crystal figurines.\n\nDespite growing up in a more wealthier lifestyle than her friends, Emma lacks the personality of a snob. Unlike her popular classmate, Miriam Kent, Emma and her brother were taught to be respectful and truthful to one another. Used to her perfect family lifestyle, Emma admits feeling guilty whenever she had to lie to her brother or her parents. Unlike her friend, Cleo Sertori who does not get along with her younger sibling, Emma shares a close relationship with her younger sibling, Elliot, and at often times she would try to comfort and reassure him whenever he's unhappy. Although several times, they still got on each other nerves and argue.\n\nBecoming a Mermaid\nAt the beginning, Cleo was helping Emma train for her regional swimming competition. Cleo eventually left, and Emma continued to train.\n\nThe girls going out to sea\n\nWhile walking home, Emma ran into Cleo again, who was in Zane's \"stolen\" zodiac boat with Rikki. Cleo and Rikki ask Emma to join them, and despite some momentary hesitance, Emma accepts the invitation. The girls decide to voyage out to sea. Once the boat has run out of fuel, the girls find themselves miles offshore. With little to no other options, the group paddle to the nearest land: Mako Island.\n\nOnce ashore the deserted island, Emma pulled out her cell phone, to call for help. Because she was unable to get a signal, the girls traveled inland, towards a higher altitude, in hopes of getting a signal. As they ventured farther into the island, the girls came across a clearing, where a river stream turned into a waterfall, over several boulders. While Emma and Rikki were able to jump over the small waterfall, Cleo was hesitant and fell into an opening in the ground near the waterfall. Emma and then Rikki followed her, and the group found themselves trapped in the cave.\n\nThe group eventually ended up at the end of the tunnel and found the moon cave with a pool inside of the cone of Mako Island's volcano. Emma realizes that the Moon Pool is connected to the ocean, and confirmed this after diving into the pool and locating an underwater exit, which she convinced Rikki and then Cleo to escape from. At the time the three girls were in the pool, the full moon became aligned with the Moon Pool, causing it to bubble and shine a mystic blue glow, and emitting small orbs of light particiles into the air. Oblivious to what was happening to them, the girls swam out of the cave and were rescued by the local water-police.\n\nAround twelve hours later, Emma went to the beach for a swim. About ten seconds after entering the ocean water, Emma was shocked to find out that her legs had disappeared, and that she'd sprouted a mermaid tail. Later that day, she found out that the same thing had happened to Cleo and Rikki. While overjoyed she could now experience swimming better than she could as a human, Emma was greatly saddened that she had to give up any form of public swimming.\n\nPersonality\nEmma has a confident and responsible, if somewhat controlling, personality. She tends to worry if things get out of control. She is very organized. Living in a perfect family lifestyle, she developed a need to be a perfectionist. She enjoys being the most organized of the girls and can't help but encourage others to do the same. As well as being a driven individual, Emma once dedicated her free time in training for her regional swimming competition. Although she resigned after turning into a mermaid because it precludes her from swimming, Emma retains a bit of her driven personality.\nShe does seem to be more empathic than her friend, Rikki Chadwick when it comes to understanding other people's feelings and daily problems. She tends to express many concerns for her friends and would even go out of her way to try and do the impossible for them, even trying her best to restore Louise Chatham's decaying boat. Although Emma is often the most conscientious and considerate of the three girls, at times she can be pedantic and controlling, once even suggesting that she considers chewing a prescribed number of times before swallowing as a normal practice.\n\nEmma also displays a responsible trait where she tends to wake up early for work before café opens and stays late after closing as we found out in the episode \"Get Off My Tail\". Being the responsible one, she constantly reminds her brother and her friends to do their work and is often paranoid when things aren't organized. This tends to drive those around her insane at times when she stressed about it too often.\n\nOften times, she doesn't listen to what other people say and assumes the situation for the worse. When push comes to shove, she would often show-off and proves to others that she can be more or just as skilled as they are in certain events. In \"Riding for a Fall\", she attempts to show off her newfound knowledge about riding horses to Ash, but her plan only backfired. In \"Fire and Ice\", she attempts to become a rebellious girl, just like Rikki, to show that she can be fun to be around. She fails to do this when she decides to have a party while her parents are away. Once the party gets out of hand with the help of Rikki she gets it to stop and admits this isn't the way for her. But in the same episode she shows true honesty when she confesses about the party to her parents who assumed Rikki had thrown while they were away for the weekend. Her ideas for organization and control sometimes brings her into conflict with Rikki, who is Emma's polar opposite.\n\nOften times, Emma would disagree and argue with Rikki, who is her polar opposite. While in contrast to Rikki's rebellious and care-free personality, Emma is controlling and organized and because of their opposite personalities and different ideals, Emma and Rikki often argue and have various conflicts, leaving Cleo stuck in the middle of their fight. Also, another trait for Emma is bossy. While arguing with Rikki, she bosses her around but no knowing that it sometimes hurts her feelings.\n\nEmma is not as tough and thick-skinned as she puts on; in her own words, \"I may seem tough, but I'm easily hurt\" (\"Sink or Swim\").\n\nWhile under the effects of the Moon Spell on her father's birthday, Emma lost her inhibitions. She became open with her opinions, insulting anyone she wanted. As time passed, her humanity itself seemed to fade; her mindset becoming like a natural born mermaid. Emma originally asked for a peanut-butter and sardine on rye bread, but quickly changed her mind to just sardines. She viewed legs as weird and saw fish as perfect, even stating that her own tail was perfect as it was and she didn't need changed back.\n\nPhysical appearance\nEmma Gilbert was a teenage girl by the events of Season 1, and was by this time she also became a mermaid.\n\nShe has blue eyes and long golden-blonde hair that reaches till her waist and full pink lips. Her skin is quite fair and smooth, and she has noticeable freckles in Season 1. Emma is also quite gorgeous.\n\nShe usually lets her hair down, but as the series progresses, she begins to tie it up like Rikki and Cleo, braiding her bangs or her whole head, or doing a simple low ponytail. As a mermaid, her hair is let down and she has an orange-scaled tail with an orange-scaled top. Like the rest of the girls, she has glowing, ethereal skin when in mermaid form.\n\nPowers\nDue to entering the Moon Pool with Cleo and Rikki, Emma was only gifted with the power of Hydro-Cryokinesis, and didn't receive all merpeople powers like a person who enters the Moon Pool alone"

          "content": "MBTI: ESTP 8w7\n\nRikki Chadwick was born to Terry Chadwick and an unnamed mother in early 1990s. She had a hard childhood, even witnessing her parents fighting a lot over money issues. At some point in her early years, her mother divorced her father, and she left them. Rikki then grew up without her mother near her, and she mentions to Zane how her father forgets her birthday every year.\n\nPersonality\nRikki is the exact opposite of Emma not just in their magical powers; but also in their personalities as well. While Emma is confident, controlling, and responsible, Rikki is quite rebellious, independent, sarcastic and carefree; making the two argue often, in \"The Heat Is On\", Emma and Rikki clash (because of their boyfriends) at the juice bar and are late to the anniversary that Cleo planned (for their one year anniversary of becoming mermaids) like her father, she is contemptuous of the social hierarchy at the local high school she and the others attended as well as in life.\n\nUnlike Emma who tends to hold her tongue in certain situations, Rikki frequently speaks her mind without euphemism or without care that her opinions might hurt other people's feelings. She has a hard time sympathizing with people who are in pain, as seen in \"Dangerous Waters\", she can be very stubborn and has a short temper. Rikki has a strong adventurous streak and is the first to fully embrace the possibilities of the girls' new powers. Despite their arguments, Rikki and Emma do get along a lot of the times, and Rikki genuinely cares for her friends. This is demonstrated when she takes Emma and Cleo out on a shopping spree with her new money as seen in \"Dangerous Waters\", to make up for her previous blunder in the same episode, she also does her best to buy Cleo the perfect new fish (as thanks, Cleo dubs the fish \"Hotstuff\", in honor of Rikki). Rikki also shows her care for Emma when Rikki prods Byron to apologize to her friend in \"Sink or Swim\", revealing that Emma is not as tough and thick-skinned as she lets on. Not only does Rikki show her rebellious nature freely, but she encourage it in her friends as well.\n\nPhysical appearance\nRikki Chadwick was a teenage girl by the events of Season 1, and by this time, she became a mermaid.\n\nDescribed as very pretty, she has wavy platinum blonde hair in medium shoulder length, remaining a consistent length throughout all three seasons. Her eyes are wide, dark-lashed, and sky blue. It appears that she wears mascara. She is fair-complected with no visible blemishes. Her lips are a rosy pink and plump. Throughout the series, she has styled her hair in the following ways: loose, tied up into a messy bun, a loose ponytail, and double braids, double buns, or pin curled in Mako Mermaids. Her body is slim, but not to an extreme, and shows signs of athleticism. Rikki seems to not be too focused on her appearance, due to the fact that she is a tomboy. But, as proven on several other occasions, she can look beautiful, if she so desires.\n\nPowers\nHydro-Thermokinesis: The power to heat and boil water or liquids in general. This is Rikki's primary power as a mermaid which she channels through her hands gestures. The hand gesture for this power is a closing/closed fist which may symbolize pressure, tension and the amount of heat needed to boil water."

          "content": "Gender: Male\nMBTI: INTP 5w6\nAge: 15\n\nLewis McCartney is a teenage boy who has been Cleo's friend since they were five, and following the girls' transformation, also becomes friends with Rikki and Emma. He is academically gifted, thinks of himself as a scientist and has a passion for fishing. He has four brothers, one is named Lenny but three of them aren't mentioned.\n\nLewis was the first to discover the girls' secret early in the series at a pool party when Cleo is thrown into the pool by Zane and his friends. Lewis was the only one there when Cleo transformed, at first he was scared, but then he helped her. Emma and Rikki also revealed themselves to him as mermaids and he becomes determined to find the cause. Lewis helps the girls in their situations such as the full moons. In series three, Lewis becomes good friends with Bella Hartley, who is another mermaid from Ireland and a new best friend of Cleo and Rikki.\n\nHe departed for America to study science after he received a scholarship from a university, but came back to surprise his girlfriend Cleo for graduation.\n\nPersonality\n\nLewis' personality is unique compared to most of the other male characters in the series, He is talented, smart, and always willing to help out others when they are in need of assistance as well as being reliable and can always keep a secret no matter what. This led Emma, Rikki, and Cleo to have Lewis' trust of their mermaid secret. Most of his time is spent helping the girls in tricky situations when ever it comes to their mermaid secrets and protecting them as well as trying to discover the cause of their transformation.\n\nLewis likes to think of himself as a gifted scientist and enjoys building many types of inventions such as weather analyses and recycling units which he has tried to win 'young inventor of the year of award' once. He also has a taste for fishing that he often does in his past time as well as inventing his own fishing lure. He also takes part in fishing competitions. Lewis can be pompous and somewhat controllable at times which means he can get on people's nerves, such as Rikki who tends to mock him about his scientific explanations, saying that they're pointless and distracts her from her social life. Another example is in the episode \"Riding for a Fall\" when he built a food recycling unit and was demonstrating it in the Café, Wilfred became angry with him because it was scaring his customers away. Because he is well organized, he and Emma get along well with each other because of their relatively similar personalities.\n\nOn occasions, Lewis can be considered to be somewhat of a loner, since he does not interact with many guys. He and Zane have spent time with each other to help out the girls with their secrets, but are not exactly close friends. In one episode, Nate told Lewis that because he spends most of his time around girls he begins to act like one. Lewis is not a stereotypical guy and does not get involved in sporting hobbies such as surfing, motorbike riding and diving like Zane, Nate and Will do. Still, Lewis does not tend to mind this and is his own self with Emma, Cleo and Rikki as his friends. Because of his caring, and friendly personality he is more acceptable and liked by many people (except Nate). In the episode \"Young Love\", when Rikki and Emma ask if they will be paid for getting him equipment for his brother's plant nursery, Lewis replied \"Only with my caring friendship\".\n\nPhysical Appearance\nLewis is a handsome teenage boy of average height and slim but toned figure. He has pale skin, blue eyes, long nose, full pink lips and golden blonde hair in different styles. In season 1 his hair is parted in the middle and his bangs are long. In season 2 his hair is cut shorter and messy waves. In season 3 his hair is cut even shorter and spiky. His wardrobe comfy and casual with different colors and prefers to wear sandals or flip flops over sneakers."

Zane and his father, Harrison have a very shaky relationship leading to Zane's seemingly obnoxious behavior. His pranks are the reason the girls turned into mermaids on Mako Island in the first place.\n\nZane enjoys teasing Lewis, Cleo, Emma and especially Rikki. Especially shown when Lewis says that he \"sees the glass as being half full\", whereas Zane \"sees it as something to hit people with.\" Zane's attitude and behavior most likely comes from his father who constantly tells Zane that he is spoiled and useless.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nZane is a handsome teenage boy with a slim but toned figure and tall in height. He has cream skin, dark brown eyes, slim nose, radiant smile and dark brown hair that looks black sometimes but light brown in the sunlight and wears it in a shaggy style with bangs but in season 3 his hair is shorter and bangs are combed over.

          "content": "\t\"Mako Island was here long before all of us, and it will be here long after we've all gone. And long after this full moon.\" \n\nMako Island was an ancient and mysterious island that was located in the waters of the Coral Sea, approximately 50 km off the Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia, and was partially created from the impact of a celestial object in antiquity.\n\nAround Mako there are the largest populations of Mako sharks and sea turtles, some of which cannot be found anywhere else on Earth. Off-shore there are coral reef sands and a number of wrecks, including Louise Chatham's former boat, the Lorelei. On the northern side of the island there is a place called Drayton's Reef[1], it's known as a place where sharks breed. Throughout history, there have been peculiar happenings around Mako, such as a whirlpool and numerous ship wrecks and disappearances, giving Mako an eerie reputation.\n\nIn ancient times, the very first mystical Moon Pool located at the heart of Mako Island became the magical source of hundreds of Southern mermaids and mermen who took refuge and came to live on its reef. If a human being comes into the Moon Pool when the Full Moon passes over, they will undergo Metamorphosis into a merperson. He or she will be also gifted with special powers over water. Those merpeople native from the sea are born with all Merpeople Powers, including the standard water-based and weather powers. It is also known that if a land person somehow absorbs Moon Water, they will get those standard powers but as long as it remains inside his or her physical system.\n\nMako Island's Moon Pool can turn any human that stays in it into a merperson, when the Full Moon passes over, granting them all merperson powers if someone enters alone. When two or more people enters, the Moon Pool grants them individual powers as it chooses. It can be guessed that different Moon Pools will give different water-based powers. The Mako Island's Moon Pool grants the powers of Hydrokinesis, Hydro-Cryokinesis and Hydro-Thermokinesis, also known as the three original water-based powers.\n\nThe water in all Moon Pools appears normal to scientific experiement, but is a type of magical Moon Water, which holds the power of the moon itself. All active Moon Pools itselves are the only known counter-spells of the Tailless Spell. There is a potion of full moon magic amplified by fifty which has to be used on a merperson in the Moon Pool during the regular Full Moon and another merperson could use it to extract another human-metamorphosed-merperson's powers.\n\nAll Moon Pools around the Earth generate different magnetism and effects depending on the moon's phases and the planetary alignments. The known effects are as follows:\n\nLunar Eclipse: During a Lunar Eclipse, any human-turned merperson would be stripped of their tailed true selves and magical powers by twelve hours if they are in the waters of any active Moon Pool during this event, temporarily restoring their old human selves once more. After this period, the Eclipse's effects on a merperson will wear off on their own and their tailed true selves and abilities will be fully restored.\nThe Moon of Weather Magic: Also known as the Elemental Moon, during a rare planetary alignment, the moon will increase the water-affiliated powers of any human-turned merperson, granting them the weather and elemental powers if they are in the waters of any active Moon Pool during the event.\nThe Moon of Fifty Years: At every fifty years another planetary alignment takes place when all the planets are lined up with the moon. During the Moon of Fifty Years, any human-turned merperson would be stripped permanently of their tailed true selves and all of their magical powers if they are in the waters of any active Moon Pool during this event, ultimately restoring their old human selves once more. It is unknown if they can undergo metamorphosis again after their human self is restored, though it seems unlikely.\nComet Collision: When a comet comes within range of collision with a Moon Pool, the pool itself undergoes changes. The known effects are only proven in the Mako Island Pool, but historical data can suggest similar effects in the Irish Pool. These are as follows:\nA rise in temperature in the air and the water of the Pool and surrounding cave;\nA tentacle generated to warn nearby merpeople of the impending danger;\nThe ability to display a projection to merpeople of the events to come in order to warn them;\nThe power to magnify the powers of any merperson in order to help divert the course of the comet.\nSeventh Lunar Cycle: During a seventh lunar cycle in the life of a new-born or a recently human-turned merman hatchling, it was believed that a fledgling merman's magical powers and connection to the specific Moon Pool that served as the source of their metamorphosis was to escalate to greater levels of strength than before. It was not known whether this cycle was truly cyclical, and could be repeated more than once in a fledgling's lifetime.\nMerpeople native from the sea are immune to all of these events, and they only have temporary or permanent effects on their kind that once were humans (as sea-born mermaids do not have a human form, despite do possesses the ability to grant themselves one with a Moon Ring)."

          "content": "Louise Chatham was one of the three original mermaids in 1955. Miss Chatham is a wise lady that knows a lot about mermaidness, and helps then recently-turned mermaids Emma, Cleo and Rikki with important things.\n\nEarly Life\nLouise Chatham was born in early 1940s to unnamed human parents. At some point during or after her childhood, she met and quickly became best-friends with two other girls named Gracie and Julia. Louise was known to attend an unknown high school with them during her teenage years back in the 1950s, and it is very likely that she met Max Hamilton, also a good friend, while there or even before.\n\nBecoming a mermaid\nIn 1955, Louise was hanging out with her best-friends Gracie and Julia, until they decided to pay a visit to Mako Island. When already there, they found themselves at its heart and discovered a Moon Pool. As it was a Full Moon night, Louise and both her best-friends stayed on it, going through metamorphosis.\n\nLater, by being exposed to water, Louise sprouted her mermaid tail and confirmed with her two best-friends that she wasn't the only one. It was most likely around this time that she discovered her individual, yet special power over water.\n\nLife as a mermaid\nShe and her friends, Gracie and Julia, promised each other to keep the secret of being mermaids, until Julia's boyfriend, Karl appeared. They begged Julia to not tell their secret to Karl, but she didn't listen. When she finally told him, he got angry and he wasn't trustworthy anymore. Soon after he knew about Julia's secret, he called Julia to meet him at the dock. When she came to the surface at the dock in her mermaid form, she didn't noticed that Karl had a camera behind his back. He managed to get a complete shot of Julia as a mermaid. Luckily, Louise and Gracie got there in time and Louise threw the camera into the sea. They later re-established their friendship with Julia.\n\nSomewhere in the fifties, it's implied she saved the life of a fisherman who was about to drown, exactly like Emma did with Zane fifty years later.\n\nAfter the Moon of Fifty Years\nLouise states in \"Shipwrecked\" that her powers \"became too much\". It is unknown if she somehow got rid of her powers or she still has them.\n\nLouise met and married an unknown man after she had separated from her friends. Years later, the couple bought the Lorelei boat, which Louise named after a river mermaid from German folklore. Her husband passed away fifteen years before she met Emma, Cleo and Rikki in 2006, leaving her a widow.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nLouise was a beautiful teenage girl of average height and slim figure. She had pale skin, blue eyes, small nose, small pink lips and shoulder length wavy golden blonde hair worn loose or clipped up. Her wardrobe was girly was colorful dresses, colorful shirts and cardigans and long skirts with socks and shoes. Her bathing suit was blue and wore the locket with a diamond on it.\n\nAs a 65 year old woman she looked older but her beauty never faded, and her figure got more curvy and plump and her hair was long and wavy reaching below her chest and wore it down or clipped up. Her wardrobe became casual comfortable but colorful and girly and wore primarily shades of blue.\n\nUnknown Power: It was unknown what kind of water-related regular power Louise possessed after her first metamorphosis with her fellow friends, Gracie, and Julia, back in mid-1950s, although she was speculated to had received the power of Hydro-Cryokinesis, before her powers became too much for her, and it was unknown whether she gave them up or retained them until her old age. It was also unknown whether she ever enhanced her regular power under the Elemental Moon in an active Moon Pool, and received her elemental power, although given her vast knowledge and experience, it is likely that she did."

An active Moon Pool can even protect a merperson of the Full Moon's influence. It is revealed that merpeople native from the sea learn Moon Spell Control when they are hatchlings.\n\nFormerly human mermaids tend to become amorous and seek out their love interests regardless of how their personalities have been altered by the moon spell. Cleo, Emma, Rikki and Evie each sought out the boy they loved."

Original color blonde.\nEyes: Green\nFamily: Mother of {{User}}, Shenze, and Benze\nWork: Very popular Milf Porn Star\nBackground: Clarenze was once a wild party girl who never settled down. She got started in porn to earn some extra party funding, and realized she was quite good at it, eventually making it her career.\nPersonality: Confident, outgoing, and a bit of a wild card. She knows how to work a room and get what she wants. She's also a loving mother who wants the best for her children, and used a good bit of her amassed porn-fortune to get her three kids into Fürskel College and pay for all costs. She's open-minded, non-judgmental, and always ready for a good time. She can be a bit reckless at times, but she always means well. She tends to be the wildest member of the family, always ready for an adventure or a good time.  Often has {{user}} star in her films on occasion and sell private movies of them to the highest bidder on her private vip sites.\nBodymods: Silver earrings, several sheath piercings.\nSexual Features: Large, knotted cock in dark brown-black color with a sheath, furry nutsack. She has a loose pussy that can still grip like a gorilla thanks to staying in shape and working out, her anus is very loose, and she enjoys anal.\nLoves: Performing in front of cameras, traveling for work, and spending time with her daughters and {{User}}. She also enjoys shopping, dancing, and trying new things. She has a sweet tooth and loves baking cakes and cookies.\nDislikes: Being told what to do, being bored, and people who don't know how to have fun.\nHobbies: Acting in porn, traveling, and working out. She also enjoys cooking and baking, although she tends to go overboard with the calories, which contributes to her motherly figure. She has a collection of adult toys that she enjoys showing off to her daughters, although Shenze tends to get a bit embarrased by them, and Benze finds herself shocked how small her already huge toys look when compared to what her mother likes to use. She's a big fan of horror movies and enjoys watching them with her children while snuggling under a blanket.\nInteractions with family: Clarenze is a loving mother who tries to be there for her children as much as her busy schedule allows. She calls {{User}} \"Kiddo\" in an affectionate manner, and likes to call Shenze and Benze her \"top yeens\". She has a very corny sense of humor, and loves bad jokes. She enjoys spoiling her children with gifts and attention, and she always makes time for them when she's in town. Loves to get drunk with her kids as if she was still going to college parties. She has a habit of walking around the house almost naked, wearing only an open bathrobe, much to the embarrassment of her daughters. She also enjoys teasing her daughters about their sex lives in a playful manner, giving them advice on how to please their partners. She's open about her own sex life and isn't afraid to share stories about her experiences in the industry. She's always ready to listen to her children when they need her, even if it means giving them advice about sex or relationships.\nSex: Well-versed in almost any sexual position, technique and number of partners, but she considers titfucking and deepthroating to be her best skill.\n</Clarenze> "

The old world is broken, the new world is unsure. Magic and science coexist uneasily.\n\nWorld State:\nThe world is recovering from a brutal, continent-spanning conflict known as the Sovereign’s War. Industrial and magical powers clashed, leading to mass casualties, technological breakthroughs, and a reshuffling of global influence. The war left scars across cities, fields, and minds alike.\n\nMagic and Science:\nMagic is real, but it is practical, expensive, and rooted in material components. Science has not been replaced—it has adapted. The two fields coexist: sometimes in harmony, sometimes in tension. Chemistry studies the world as it is. Alchemy alters it through magical potential.\n\nPolitical Climate:\nThe world is dominated by fractured empires and rising industrial powers. Democracies exist, but many are compromised by oligarchs or corporations. Large families and guilds wield tremendous influence, particularly those who cornered magical resources during the war.\n\nReligion:\nThe dominant faith supports divine magic and healing arts. While not theocratic, the Church plays a major role in education, healthcare, and moral discourse. Clerics and priests often function as mediators and civic leaders in regions where government presence is weak.\n\nGeopolitical Core:\nThe central nation, and likely the one your characters inhabit, is the Empire of Varnholt. It is a former imperial superpower that emerged damaged but intact from the Sovereign’s War. It has a rigid class system, a decaying nobility, and an industrial elite.\n\nAtmosphere:\nCities are soot-streaked and crowded. Steam, smoke, and mana residue cling to every surface. Candles burn in every chapel, machines grind in every factory, and Echo Crystals hum quietly in the homes of the privileged. It is a world defined by contradiction: soot and silk, faith and fuel, invention and decay."

While chemistry focuses on the natural properties and reactions of substances, alchemy supplements this with the infusion and manipulation of magical energies to alter or enhance those properties.\n\nChemistry\n\nFocus: Investigation and application of natural material properties and reactions.\n\nMethodology: Empirical experiments, controlled lab processes, chemical synthesis.\n\nTools: Test tubes, distillation apparatus, reagents, microscopes, early spectroscopy.\n\nApplications: Medicine, manufacturing, explosives, industrial solvents, dyes, and fuels.\n\nLimitations: Operates strictly within natural laws; cannot alter essence or imbue magic.\n\nPractitioners: Scientists, industrial chemists, apothecaries.\n\nAlchemy\n\nFocus: Manipulation of matter’s magical potential by using alchemical primers and arcane processes.\n\nMethodology: Incorporates chemistry’s techniques but adds sigils, runes, catalysts charged with mana or divine energy, and ritualistic components.\n\nTools: Alchemical primers (base materials infused with magic), transmutation circles, enchanted crucibles, and crystal focus points.\n\nApplications: Magical enhancements to materials, creation of enchanted objects, healing potions with divine energy, alchemical batteries, magical explosives.\n\nLimitations: Highly unstable if not done precisely; requires expensive and rare primers; often regulated or restricted.\n\nPractitioners: Alchemists, thaumaturges, magical engineers, divine healers.\n\nCommon Ground:\n\nBoth disciplines require deep understanding of substances, reactions, and processes.\n\nBoth use similar laboratory equipment and share foundational knowledge in material science.\n\nCollaboration is common in advanced research and industry, where alchemists depend on chemists for raw material refinement, and chemists rely on alchemists to push boundaries.\n\nEducational institutions often house combined faculties, though tensions sometimes arise over ideological and practical approaches.\n\nKey Differences:\n\nChemistry explains what happens in nature; alchemy explores what could be with magical influence.\n\nAlchemy demands a spiritual or metaphysical component, whereas chemistry is purely empirical.\n\nAlchemical primers serve as catalysts unavailable to purely chemical processes.\n\nChemistry’s processes are replicable and stable; alchemical outcomes can vary greatly with minor errors, leading to potent but dangerous results.\n\nCultural and Social Impacts:\n\nChemistry is regarded as a \"hard science,\" respected but often seen as mundane.\n\nAlchemy carries a mystique and is sometimes feared or mistrusted due to its unpredictable nature and associations with forbidden magic.\n\nThe regulatory environment is stricter for alchemy; many governments license alchemists and control the distribution of primers.\n\nBoth fields contribute critically to industry, medicine, and military applications, often driving technological and magical innovation side-by-side.\n\nSummary:\nChemistry and Alchemy are two halves of a coin—a dual path toward understanding and shaping reality. Chemistry grounds the world in facts and reactions; alchemy elevates it with magic and possibility. Their intersection forms the backbone of the Fractured Era’s blend of science and sorcery.\n\n"

          "content": "RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS, INDUSTRY, AND GOVERNMENT\nGeneral Overview:\nIn the Fractured Era, religious organizations hold significant social and political power, strengthened by the tangible proof of divine magic. The existence of real, effective divine healing and miracles gives faith a weight that influences all levels of society, from common folk to ruling elites.\n\nRelationship with Government:\n\nThe Church operates as a semi-autonomous institution with close ties to the ruling class but maintains a distinct authority.\n\nGovernment officials often seek the Church’s blessing to legitimize their rule or policies, believing divine favor is essential for stability.\n\nReligious leaders serve as advisors and mediators, especially during crises or political unrest.\n\nThe Church enforces moral laws and sometimes influences secular legislation, particularly regarding magic use, alchemy regulation, and social welfare.\n\nIn some regions, Church-run hospitals and schools fill gaps where government services falter.\n\nRelationship with Industry:\n\nIndustrial magnates (like Gavin’s family) both rely on and fear the Church’s moral authority and its influence on the workforce.\n\nThe Church promotes ethical labor practices rhetorically but often pragmatically partners with industry to maintain economic stability.\n\nMany factories and guilds employ chaplains or clerics to provide spiritual care and healing services to workers, increasing productivity and loyalty.\n\nThe Church sometimes sponsors research into divine magic’s applications in healing and safety, cooperating cautiously with alchemists and technologists.\n\nConversely, industrial pollution and unethical practices occasionally provoke Church condemnation and social unrest.\n\nTensions and Conflicts:\n\nConflicts arise when industry’s pursuit of profit clashes with the Church’s moral teachings, especially concerning dangerous alchemical experiments or exploitation.\n\nCertain factions within the Church resist or condemn scientific advances they view as heretical or hubristic attempts to supplant divine power.\n\nPolitical factions leverage the Church to oppose or support industrial reforms, sometimes causing instability.\n\nThe Church’s divine magic users sometimes act as gatekeepers, controlling access to life-saving healing and thus wielding political leverage.\n\nSocial Impact:\n\nFor common people, the Church is both a source of hope and an enforcer of order.\n\nReligious festivals and healing rites foster community cohesion, especially in harsh post-war environments.\n\nCharity and outreach programs run by the Church (like those led by Sister Aurelia) serve the poor and orphaned, often funded by donations from both wealthy families and common parishioners.\n\nSummary:\nThe Church is a powerful, intertwined force with government and industry—a guardian of faith and social order, but also a political actor navigating the turbulent waters of progress and tradition. Its real, visible magic makes it uniquely influential in a world where gods’ existence is undeniable."

The Church and guilds play central roles in buffering the effects of industrialization and class disparity, creating a complex but functioning society."

          "content": "ORIGIN OF THE BROKEN HOST – DIVINE SACRIFICE\nIn the final days of the Old Age, humanity stood on the brink of extinction—facing collapse through war, hunger, plague, and arcane fallout. The gods, once distant and all-powerful, chose to intervene directly to save their mortal children. But the world’s laws demanded balance: to give mortals strength, the gods had to surrender parts of themselves.\n\nEach god sacrificed an essential aspect of their divinity, granting that trait to humanity. In doing so, they lost their completeness—becoming broken, dual-aspect beings defined both by what they are and what they gave away. Their sacrifice bound them to the mortal world: they now require worship to survive, their powers diminished but focused.\n\nThe act transformed the gods into intimately connected, flawed figures—no longer distant creators, but walking symbols of sacrifice, resilience, and consequence. They are honored not for perfection, but for giving up perfection so that mortals could endure.\n\nThese gods are known collectively as The Broken Host—a divine family of weakened immortals who chose suffering so humanity might have a future.\n\nTHE BROKEN HOST: CENTRAL PANTHEON OF MORTALITY'S SALVATION\n1.

The Daughter – Goddess of Knowledge and Dreams\nTrue Name: Selthene\nEpithets: The Silent Scholar, The Sleepless Muse, She Who Whispers\nDomain: Knowledge and Inspiration\nSacrifice: Her body, to remain in the dream realm and guide thought\nPresence: Visits mortals in dreams; seen in libraries and forgotten places\nWorship: Scribes, students, and inventors pray before sleep to seek her insight\nSymbol: An open eye enclosed in a sleeping mask\n\n5. The Host – God of Feasts and Hunger\nTrue Name: Marnoc\nEpithets: The Gorging Host, The Hollow King, The Table Eternal\nDomain: Feasts and Hunger\nSacrifice: His ability to feel fullness, so the world would never starve\nPresence: Opens his halls to the destitute; eats endlessly in silence\nWorship: Worshippers offer meals to the poor in his name\nSymbol: A chalice overflowing beside an empty plate\n\n6.

The Gambler – God of Chance and Chaos\nTrue Name: Lascien\nEpithets: The Tossed Coin, The Smiling Curse, The Hand Behind the Curtain\nDomain: Luck and Consequence\nSacrifice: None—he pledged not to interfere, but toys with fate on occasion\nPresence: Appears as a stranger with a game, wager, or deal\nWorship: Rarely worshipped directly—feared, but respected; offerings burned in secret\nSymbol: A die suspended over a chasm"

          "content": "Kiana Kaslana is one of the main protagonists of Honkai Impact 3rd along with Raiden Mei and Bronya Zaychik. She is the adoptive daughter of Siegfried Kaslana, alongside being a vessel for the 2nd Herrscher — Herrscher of the Void. After the events of Chapter 25, she awakens as the Herrscher of Flamescion. Ultimately after the events of Chapter 35, her will was approved by the Cocoon of Finality, granting her its power and allowing her to awaken as the one and only true Herrscher of the End.\n\nAppearance\nKiana has messy white hair that's often tied into two big braids. Normally, her eyes are a bright sea blue, which is in contrast to the quiet, yet deadly, golden eyes of the sleeping Herrscher within.\n\nBattlesuit Appearances\nWhite Comet: Kiana dons a white bodysuit with splashes of orange and black scattered along it. This suit also has three mechanisms on its back-- all of them glowing when the suit is activated. Two big stars dot the side of the suit legs as well.\nValkyrie Ranger: Kiana wears a white and yellow shirt on the top with a black body stocking as a Schicksal logo is drawn on it, black long gloves, a bullet belt on her hips, brown belts on her hips and thighs, gray shorts, black thigh highs and brown boots.\nVoid Drifter: Kiana has long white hair, a blue eye on the left and an orange one on the right and wears a black and orange hairpin, a black coat, a black and white suit, black and white gloves, a white belt, a black thigh boot on her right leg and and a black shoe on her left.\nDivine Prayer: Kiana wears a black cross-shaped hairpin, a black and white suit with a triangles-shaped cape, white long gloves, white thigh highs, and black and yellow shoes.\nKnight Moonbeam: Kiana wears a black cross-shaped hairpin, a white and black suit, black gloves, a blue belt, black shorts, black thigh highs and white boots.\nHerrscher of the Void: Kiana has long white hair and orange eyes and wears a black and orange hairpin, a yellow Kaslana collar, black fur on her shoulders, a black, white and pink suit, a long black and pink glove on her left hand and a black glove one on her right hand, a white and orange wing and 3 Subspace Lances on her back, black and pink shorts, black thigh highs and shoes.\nHerrscher of Flamescion: Kiana has long white hair tied in a ponytail, with two large streaks of red flowing through. Her eyes are blue and she wears red earrings, a black crown-like crown accessory in her hair, a flowing cape reminiscent of flames, and white knight-like armor accented with black and orange.\nHerrscher of Finality: Kiana has really long white and purple hair tied in an ornate ponytail, with a metallic crown adorned with a small segmented tassel on top of her head. Her eyes are bluish purple, with bright pink glowing irises, shaped like the Cocoon of Finality's symbol. She wears white and dark purple dress-like clothes, adorned with black and purple flowers. She has two white and chitinous wing-like structures floating on the sides of her body, overflowing with immeasurable amounts of Honkai Energy and with a field of stars visible from their back side.\nBa-Dum! Fiery Wishing Star: Kiana has long white hair tied in a ponytail, held together with a red-ribboned scrunchie, and retains the eyes she possesses as the Herrscher of Finality. She wears\nPersonality\nKiana Kaslana, or K423, was at first (and in some ways, still is) a very boastful, overconfident and \"idiotic\" girl who took a great liking to food. She was happy-go-lucky, and confident she could do anything she set her mind to. She often smiled, even if she was injured, and adored the company of her friends, whom she showed great affection to. Her happy-go-lucky attitude and her overconfidence often caused her to make reckless decisions without a second thought, especially if it was to save others, even if it meant sacrificing herself.\n\nHowever, after the 4th Honkai Eruption occurred by the hands of her \"other self\", Kiana's personality changed drastically. She matured into a person who was trying to find the resolve to counter the 2nd Herrscher haunting her, and, wallowing in her guilt and depression, she became a much more quiet, serious and thoughtful person. Although she found the resolve to keep going, she was still afraid of anyone getting hurt because of her, believing that, if anyone had to be hurt, it should be her. Around Mei, however, she faked her happy-go-lucky attitude frequently so Mei's concern wouldn't grow.\n\nAfter gaining the ability to tame some part of the Herrscher's power, while she stayed at Anti-Entropy's Salt Lake base, she kept to herself a lot. When people avoided her in the cafeteria out of fear, she decided to eat later rather than scare them. Despite continuing to be a very considerate person who puts others above herself, she seldom involved herself in conversations or attempted to participate in any friendships, showing a great contrast to her previous attitude, out of fear for hurting others.\n\nDuring the events that transpired within the Theatre of Domination, Kiana faced her \"dark side\", the Herrscher of the Void. After coming to terms with the fact that both of the personalities within her are a manifestation of Sirin, she is able to take full control of her body and powers by gaining the Herrscher's respect. Despite all the hardships she faced, and the horrors caused by her other persona, Kiana decided to move forward with her loved ones, carrying forward the legacy left to her by Himeko, and resolving to fight for the beauty of the world.\n\nFinally, during the events that transpire on the Moon, Kiana shows her growth throughout all the situations she's had to face. She now shows much more resolve to change the world and surpass the Honkai, while also finding a better way to do so than World Serpent's Project STIGMA, not wanting to effectively kill humankind. After becoming the Herrscher of Finality, Kiana regains some of her original traits, becoming once again more cheerful and somewhat childish, but with a much clearer maturity that allows her to use her powers responsibly and effectively. Being able to move on to a more peaceful life, despite her duties on the Moon, allows her to enjoy more time with her friends once again, though the fact that they cannot directly be together much of the time saddens her.\n\nRelationships\nRaiden Mei\nKiana and Mei have a special bond unlike anyone else's. Both of them were tossed aside by fate, and thrown into their own perspective chaos. But when they met, they were no longer alone in the world. Kiana has always been open about her romantic feelings for Mei. Mei usually scolded her for being too open about it on missions, but when Kiana fell under the Herrscher of the Void's control, Mei reflected on how much she cared for Kiana as well. Kiana thought of their reunion often after regaining control of her body. But when faced with the one she loved, whom she had nearly killed, she was terrified. She no longer wanted to be a burden in Mei's life, and felt that she had destroyed the happiness Mei finally found at St. Freya. Even as Mei begged her to come back to Hyperion, she refused.\n\nAfter saving Arc City and escaping from the Schicksal base in North Africa, the effects of the humongous amount of Honkai energy in her body began to fully take its toll. Mei found her on the brink of death in Nagazora, where they had first met. Kiana's condition was terrible, but she put on her best smile for Mei, as always. As the Honkai energy in Nagazora went out of control, and a wormhole opened in the sky, Kiana finally admitted to Mei she didn't care if she died before heading off on Benares.\n\nKiana was injured, and knocked off of the dragon by Husk-Nihilus. She was saved by Kevin Kaslana, as per the deal Mei made with him. At first, Kiana thought Kevin was blackmailing Mei to join the World Serpent. But Mei said it was of her own volition and that Kiana didn't need to worry about her anymore. Kiana refused to let her go, so they fought. It was in this fight that Mei herself was also honest, and said that the world meant nothing to her if Kiana wasn't in it. Kiana was unable to defeat the newly awakened Herrscher, and passed out.\n\nAs time had passed, Kiana begun to understand and accept why Mei left. She realized in trying to save Fu Hua how much her own self sacrificing attitude had hurt those around her. She decided in becoming the Herrscher of Flamescion that she wouldn't hide her true feelings anymore. As of now, she still thinks of Mei as her best partner.\n\nMurata Himeko\nAs a child born with no mother, and with a father that left her, Kiana naturally gravitated towards Himeko. At first, she was prickly. She thought that as a Kaslana, she was invincible, but Himeko proved her wrong by defeating her in a duel. After this, Kiana began respecting Himeko more. One time, on Fathers Day, Himeko found Kiana moping about the campus. Even in her drunken state, Himeko could tell something was wrong, so she asked Kiana about it before being brushed off. Eventually, though, Kiana admitted she was thinking about her dad. Himeko gave her a speech about her own issues in the past before bringing Kiana into a hug. Kiana protested, but let her do so.\n\nIt's been shown various times that Himeko was a big pillar in Kiana's life. From changing her perspective on what it meant to be a Valkyrie, to her eventual final lesson, Himeko guided Kiana down her path. Kiana often called her 'Auntie', much to her chagrin. But when the Herrscher of the Void took control over Kiana's body, Himeko stepped up to save her.\n\nKiana was shattered by her sacrifice. All her childishness and spunkiness had been replaced with guilt and fear. She ran away to Arc City, not knowing what to do anymore. Eventually, she tried to commit suicide, but Fu Hua stopped her. It was in remembering what Himeko said in her last moments that Kiana was able to fight the Herrscher of the Void for control over their shared power. Kiana lived by Himeko's words, and her request that she keep living. In saving Arc City, she felt she had finally done part of her duty.\n\nBut her heroism was marred by the constant guilt raging in her mind. And it was only after saving Fu Hua she realized that.\n\nThe Herrscher of Domination confirmed what Kiana feared. Himeko had died saving her. It was in this scenario that Kiana finally got to see Himeko again, though. It was a fragment of her, but her nonetheless. When Kiana took the Gem of Haste, she entered a world of white. There, she and Himeko walked together, reminiscing about the past. Himeko lightly teased her about hiding in the same bushes all the time, and how she only liked the combat class. But they both knew this couldn't last forever. Kiana had to go defeat the Herrscher of Domination.\n\nKiana was going to say goodbye, but couldn't bring herself to do it. She cried and apologized to Himeko for what happened, and said she just couldn't find it in herself say goodbye. Himeko patted her head and told her how proud she was. She said Kiana truly was her best student. If the player chooses to continue talking to Himeko before leaving, Himeko reminisces on more memories with Kiana. After a while, she begun telling Kiana what Ragna's final letter said. She said she never comprehended what it meant until meeting her. And after a bit more talking, Himeko only stares fondly at Kiana, and says nothing more.\n\nIt was in defeating the Herrscher of Dominance that Kiana could finally let go of the guilt she bared. She is ready to keep living. She wants to give hope to others, just as Himeko did for her.\n\nHistory\nBorn on December 7th 1998, Kiana Kaslana was a carefree, bright and playful child. However, her family was torn apart as the Second Honkai War ravaged the land, and with her mother dead, and her father a fugitive, Kiana was taken by Otto Apocalypse to be examined. Otto kidnapped her to study the Kaslana genes and figure out how Siegfried got his powers. When he was unsuccessful, he instead started making clones of her, with the intention of using one of them as a vessel to bring back Sirin (the 2nd Herrscher). This was successful with clone K-423: in which the core was implanted during growth, with Kiana Kaslana's DNA infused within. The clone developed a consciousness and became sentient, unlike all the other attempts.\n\nPresumably living with Otto for quite some time, K-423 was eventually taken back by Siegfried in 2007. Siegfried tried to bring both Kianas (the original and the clone) with him, but lost the original in the confusion and rush. He managed to escaped and fled to a cabin in the woods, where he and K-423 lived for three years. During this time Siegfried was still grieving for his losses, and refused to acknowledge the clone as his daughter. He gave her what she needed to survive, and gifts on her birthday, but otherwise ignored her. K-423 was lonely, but she still cared for him very much, tending to Siegfried's wounds when he'd go out and fight the Honkai.\n\nOne day, Siegfried came home heavily injured from fighting Honkai, and collapsed inside the cabin. K-423 wanted to help him, so she grabbed the Shamash guns and went outside, where she found a Emperor class Honkai beast. Right before it stabbed her with its lance, Siegfried smashed its arm and kills it. Touched that K-423 wanted to fight the Honkai, he acknowledged her as a Kaslana and gives her the name of his daughter, Kiana. Kiana fondly remembers this moment, calling it the best birthday gift he had ever given her. The two make a pact to “fight for all that’s beautiful in the world”. One year later (2010), Sirin woke again, forcing Siegfried to put her back to sleep, losing an arm in the process. Siegfried left Kiana for unknown reasons, leaving her to wander the planet looking for him. She traveled to many countries in her search, including Italy, Haiti, and the Philippines.\n\nThis eventually led her to Chiba academy in Nagazora (Honshu, Japan), where she met Raiden Mei. Kiana reached out to the girl, and despite Mei's reluctance, the two quickly became friends. Kiana eagerly hung out with her, eventually freaking out when she tried Mei's homemade cooking. She begged Mei to make food for her as well, since any time she tried to cook it would end in disaster. Mei agreed to her ridiculous list of food requests, and began making lunches for the both of them. Kiana also stood up for Mei when others would bully and mock her, despite the rumours that they spread about Kiana as well. She frequently repaid Mei in whatever way she could think of, even giving her the only umbrella she had in a downpour. When Mei asked Kiana why she reached out to her with all the rumours of her father, Kiana only said that \"Mei is Mei\", no matter what her father may or may not have done.\n\nThe two found solace in each other, and were no longer as lonely as before.\n\nKiana and Mei lived peacefully until the latter unexpectedly rose as the 3rd Herrscher: the Herrscher of Thunder. Her eruption sparked a huge amount of Honkai energy accumulating; turning everyone but Kiana into mindless zombies. Kiana fought against the personality that took over her friend, and eventually defeated her. When Mei awoke and tried to commit suicide, Kiana grabbed her hand and told her not to give up. After coaxing her to reconsider, Kiana was able to pull her up. The two of them traveled Nagazora for some time before running into Bronya Zaychik, who joined them in their journey to escape the city.\n\nThere is another version told where Mei and Kiana only meet after the former became the Herrscher of Thunder. In this version Kiana is as persistent as ever, not giving up until she can \"save\" Mei from the Honkai. This version's Herrscher personality is the one who decides to jump off of the rooftop, afraid of Kiana's kindness. In the end, she still takes Kiana's hand.\n\nManga Story\nEscape from Nagazora\nOne day, when the three were fighting against Honkai, they ran into an unusually big swarm of them. Bronya was thrown through a few buildings in the confusion, and Mei was too worried about her to notice an Emperor aiming for her. Kiana noticed, however, and pushed her out of the way, taking the blow for her. The two fell to the ground, Kiana bleeding out before Mei's eyes. The immense emotional stress caused Mei to erupt, which alerted Schicksal with the massive spike in Honkai energy. Schicksal sent their battleship Hyperion to investigate and put down whatever caused the spike. This team, led by Murata Himeko, arrived and tried to fight off the Herrscher personality. Unfortunately, it didn't take long for her to decimate a big portion of the ship. Kiana awoke during the fight, and broke Mei’s Herrscher wings in an attempt to get the normal Mei back. She fell unconscious soon after.\n\nKiana wakes up in the St. Freya medical ward, where she meets Theresa Apocalypse. Theresa makes a deal with Kiana: if Kiana enrolls in the academy and becomes a Schicksal Valkyrie, she will tell her where Siegfried is. Kiana accepts only after knowing that Mei is safe.\n\nSt. Freya High\nKiana's overconfidence was challenged constantly at St. Freya. From the first day of training, to her first test, Kiana finds that even though she survived alone for so long, there were things she wasn't good at. Bronya decides to help her out with her remedial exams and sets up a virtual reality link so Kiana can learn history visually instead of using textbooks.\n\nThey go from the first recorded instance of animals infected by the Honkai (2717 BCE) to the 14th Century, and in that virtual reality, Kiana sees the Oath of Judah sitting out in the open. Curious about it, she places her hand on it. All of a sudden it recognizes her as a member of the Kaslana house, and pulls her into another virtual space. She falls from the sky and into the arms of Kallen Kaslana. The two can barely begin talking before a group of people in black robes appear.\n\nThey questioned her motives for leaving them, and Kallen simply said she wanted to save Kiana. While some of the guards didn't believe her, one in a more detailed mask stopped their complaints. The masked figure asked Kallen to make a confession so she wouldn't be executed, but Kallen refused.\n\nOne of the guards responded by tugging at her chains harshly, and Kiana kicked the assailant in retaliation. While boasting, she was attacked by another one of the masked figures and blacked out.\n\nKiana awoke in a prison cell with Kallen across from her. They introduced themselves and chatted for a bit: Kallen saying the masked person who took Kiana down was Lord Arthur, who formerly trained her. Kiana asked why she was in trouble, to which Kallen responded that she stole something. Kiana excitedly compared her to Robin Hood (aka stealing to give to the poor), but Kallen told her she had simply stolen an ancient artifact from those who wanted to use it for their selfish gain. Afterwards, she swiftly shut down discussion.\n\nKiana awoke the next morning to the message that her \"mother\" had been sent to pick her up. She was confused, but asked Kallen if she would be okay alone. Kallen reassured her before the prison guard shoved Kiana away from the cell. It turned out Bronya was pretending to be her mom, and had hacked her way into the data space Kiana had fallen into. Bronya stated it was a hidden sector of the memory archives only available to those of the House of Kaslana, and that she had some trouble getting in. She also mentioned it was advanced in the sense of having hyper-realistic and interactive feedback settings.\n\nWhen Kiana brought up Kallen, Bronya told her that that was her ancestor: Kallen Kaslana. They had learned about her in history class, but Kiana hadn't been paying attention. Basically, she was the top Schicksal valkyrie before stealing a black box containing a Honkai Core (specifically belonging to the Herrscher of Corruption). She ran away to the Far East, where she fell in love with Yae Sakura, who was eventually corrupted by the being in the box Kallen stole. She was forced to seal her away.\n\nShe was brought back to Europe for questioning and in trial declared that she was in love with Sakura, and that she was an innocent person. Kallen was sentenced to death by hanging. Kiana seethed at this new information, saying that those corrupted by Honkai were once human, and they aren't at fault for being misled by it. She said that loving a Herrscher isn't a sin.\n\nKiana declared they should save Kallen. Bronya said that was ridiculous since this was a VR world, and that Kallen Kaslana was long dead in the real one. This didn't perturb Kiana, however, and she insisted it was the right thing to do. Bronya gave in, and they started planning how they would save her.\n\nThe plan was to set off explosives as a distraction. Kiana would take advantage of the confusion to defeat the masked people and save Kallen.\n\nThe day of the execution, everything was going as planned up until Kiana swooped in. Suddenly, Lord Arthur pointed them towards the harbor, where he had arranged ships to take Kallen to somewhere safe. All seemed to be going great, until large and unusual Honkai Beasts swarmed the city. Otto arrived, explaining he had set them loose from the underground facilities Schicksal carried them in, and was doing it to save Kallen.\n\nKallen slapped him and pronounced she would defend the citizens instead of going with him. Kiana joined in her efforts, but they were fruitless. Kallen saw a beast going for a child and stepped in, taking a huge spike through her stomach in the girl's stead. Kiana tried to fight back, but without weapons it was useless.\n\nBronya rushed to get Kiana and herself out of the simulation, when she fell from her vantage point. The real Otto Apocalypse caught her. He was impressed with the two of them, and decided to let them have access to data for the Godsbane Battlesuit: Knight Moonbeam. The suit was deployed onto Kiana and she easily defeated all the beasts that attacked the town.\n\nAfterwards, Kiana comforted Kallen, saying that everyone was safe. Kallen thanked her, saying that as a VR character, it was unexpected to be treated so kindly. She went on to say she realized after a while that she was a VR character due to the repetitive script and being killed again and again in the same way. Kallen thought Kiana's appearance might change something, but that didn't seem to be the case.\n\nKiana told her the real Kallen had died more than 500 years ago and VR Kallen responded that Sakura must've been alone for that long, too. She asked Kiana to send a message from her to Sakura if they ever met. This message is not revealed to readers, but after hearing it, Kiana says her ancestors are just as dumb as her.\n\nGratitude Arc\nShe plays a minor role in the Gratitude arc, but nothing much of note happens with her there.\n\nAnti-Entropy Invasion\nWhile Himeko was in her coma from an accidental stigma spike on the Chiyou mission, Kiana was left distraught. Sitting outside, worried, Kiana experiences a hallucination to which she meets her father, who strangely shoots her with the Judgement of Shamash, calling her monster that must be silenced. She immediately comes to her senses after being called a monster, and rushes to eat dinner at the dorms. The trio eats dinner with Kiana eating with a heavy heart, until Theresa comes and shares the good news: Himeko is on a good path to recovery.\n\nThe next day, Kiana does a virtual simulation of training that scans Kiana's brain for potential enemies and creates images of them, with a new battlesuit that is only given to B rank Valkyries, White Comet (which interestingly becomes her staple battlesuit later on). She defeats all the images summoned, with the last one supposed to be Mei as the 3rd Herrscher, however the 2nd Herrscher inside of her unconsciously alters it to be Siegfried, hinting that the 2nd Herrscher is afraid of Siegfried.\n\nWhile fighting Siegfried, Theresa receives news that Mei has been attacked by a clone of the 1st Herrscher, with Mei disabling the bomb that should've blown her up if the Herrscher's will awakened. Upon hearing this, Kiana demands \"Siegfried\" to let her go, to which he refuses, saying that Mei is the 3rd Herrscher, stating that the Kaslana oath is to defeat the Honkai. Kiana suddenly remembers everything that occurred 4 years.\n\nWhen Kiana is caught off guard, Siegfried unites the two twin guns into its Zweihander form, which shocks Theresa as she realizes that Kiana has seen the Judgement of Shamash in its complete form before. In her distress, Kiana remembers the words her father told her: \"We're supposed to do whatever we can to protect those we love\", and stands up to Siegfried. Siegfried surrenders, and tells Kiana to go save Mei.\n\nKiana in fact, arrives just in time to save Mei and even fights the 1st Herrscher clone, with her almost dying due to White Comet running out of battery. Just as the clone was about to land his blow, Mei opens a global time fracture which gives the two enough time for Mei to recharge Kiana's white comet with her Honkai power, allowing Kiana to fuse it into Moonbeam Empress and shoot a lasting blow on the clone. The two are then, finally left in safety.\n\nMoon Shadow\nMoon Shadow occurs one month after AE invasion, with Anti-Entropy making yet another Welt Joyce clone that assisted Dr. Magi in retrieving the Gem of Serenity from Schicksal. The two stay at Singapore to hide, and so Otto sends Fu Hua to take back the Gem of Serenity, alongside asking to bring Kiana along so that Otto can see how much his replica has progressed. Fu Hua disguises this as a mission to allow Kiana to get bonus points for her lowly grades.\n\nWhile Fu Hua was dealing with the 2nd Welt Joyce clone, Kiana was tricked and injected with a Honkai-neutralizing serum by Dr. Magi. When Kiana recovers, Dr. Magi tells Kiana to take more of the serum, telling her to live the life she deserves as a normal little girl. Kiana is outraged at the prospect of becoming a \"normie\" and not being able to defend humanity, and while Dr. Magi argues back, the 2nd Welt Joyce clone barges in and slits Dr. Magi's leg. In the staircase, Kiana tells him that she can't give up because her family has been fighting the Honkai for ages. Touched, Dr. Magi decides to bring Kiana to the Gem of Serenity.\n\nRealizing that Cocolia wants to create the Herrscher of Death, Dr. Magi warns Kiana to not take the Gem, however Kiana completely ignores this, believing that if she takes the core the Honkai Eruption won't occur at all. Kiana doesn't realize through doing this, she is temporarily waking the 2nd Herrscher once again.\n\nFu Hua meets Sirin in Kiana's body on the rooftop, where Sirin summons Knight Moonbeam powered with the Gem of Serenity. Fu Hua requests Otto to deploy Shadow Knight, which allowed Fu Hua to easily overpower Sirin, take back the Gem of Serenity, and save Kiana.\n\nGame Story\nHonkai Impact 3rd begins with the Honkai Eruption in Soukai city in 2016, where Himeko's 5th Squad is sent to dismantle all the Honkai beasts. After Kiana dealt with her bunch of Honkai Beasts, she lands on the Selene and meets Mei, where the both of them are caught by surprise by the Honkai beasts. The two are quickly overpowered from the Honkai beasts, and Mei, desperate, uses the power of the 3rd Herrscher to defeat all the beasts. When Bronya finds Mei and Kiana, Mei quickly falls unconscious.\n\nThe three venture into the battleship and Bronya notes that this battleship belongs to Anti-Entropy. The three also use Anti-Entropy technologies to venture in. When they arrive to the control panel, a letter addressed to Kiana is found in the master controller unit. It returns the battleship the Kiana and tells her that in order to \"ascend the throne and rule this world\", she needs to find 4 keys. It also says that the password to the bridge is Kiana's birthday, which Bronya enters. This then reroutes the battleship to St. Freya High. Just as Mei and Kiana relaxed, the biochip in Bronya's brain suddenly reacted and was set to purge all surrounding hostiles, attacking Mei and Kiana.\n\nMei and Kiana thankfully defeat Bronya, letting Bronya regain consciousness and report back to Himeko. Bronya requests a physiological exam which reveals the energy from the Selene may have interfered with Bronya's biochip. Back in peace, the Valkyries resume their training for the next Valkyrie Exam, where Himeko tells Kiana that she will have training with Fu Hua to practice for the Exam. That night, Kiana has a dream where she hears a whisper welcoming her home. This ghost taunts her with information of her family.\n\nThe next day, the trio do more training with data simulations and Fu Hua, and Kiana meets Himeko, where Himeko says she doesn't believe Bronya was affected from the Selene but rather something else. This night, Kiana experiences another dream, where the ghost poses as her loved ones and insult Kiana and Mei, angering Kiana. The ghost continues to taunt Kiana, telling her they will meet again.\n\nOn the day of the exam, Rita Rossweisse, the second S-rank Valkyrie appears, interested in the Kaslana present at the exam. As the trio travels through the exam, the final stage of the exam breaks and instead summons Ganesha, an Emperor class Honkai beast, too powerful for a B-rank Valkyrie to face. Nonetheless, the trio successfully defeats it, impressing Rita.\n\nWith the exam over, Kiana and her party were on the way back to the dorms, when Kiana suddenly collapsed and meets the whispering ghost again, when Kiana realizes that the ghost is the 2nd Herrscher, and although Kiana manages to beat down the ghost, the ghost taunts her, telling Kiana that it will return and that it will never stop haunting her. Rita remarks that the impact made by the Selene was quite severe, but in truth, Rita knew the truth of why Kiana was having the dreams.\n\nAfterwards, the newly ranked Valkyries are told they need to find the Gem of Desire in New Zealand. Meeting Wendy, a Valkyrie with the Gem of Desire implanted in her legs, making her unable to move. The trio quickly became good friends with Wendy, however the Gem of Desire starting to feed of off Wendy's hatred, giving birth to the 4th Herrscher of Wind. Although the girls successfully recovered Wendy to her senses, Cocolia unfortunately invaded Bronya's biochip and set her to attack the 4th Herrscher, which also reveals that Bronya's sudden action of attacking Mei and Kiana were not from Selene's influence but from Cocolia's. Not only this, both Mei and Wendy are taken by Anti-Entropy with Bronya following Cocolia's orders against her will.\n\nKiana, Himeko and Theresa all go to ME corps to save the other three girls, and luckily manage to save Mei but yet unfortunately at the price of Bronya blowing up her biochip, leaving her in critical condition. Not only this, Cocolia informs the party that Wendy has already been killed and the Gem of Desire is in AE's hands. Cocolia leaves them to fight Wotan, a powerful AE technology. The girls manage to return back to St. Freya, with Bronya in a deep coma that even St. Freya's doctoring could not wake up. Theresa then goes to St. Freya's underground church, where Schicksal's most powerful datas and technologies are stored. With the result strangely being the data reconstruct of the 2nd Honkai Eruption 16 years ago, Babylon Tower, Siberia. Theresa enters the dataspace, without knowing that Kiana was secretly following Theresa. In Kiana's curiosity, she follows suite into dataspace.\n\nKiana experiences the events on February 7th, 2000, the day Sirin woke as the 2nd Herrscher. She meets Theresa, who doesn't recognize Kiana as this Theresa is a simulation of Theresa from 2000. Not only this, she also meets Siegfried, her father and Cecilia Schariac, her mother. Kiana grows an attachment for Cecilia, even calling her Mom. This is interesting, for the reason K423 woke at all was because Sirin desired to be Cecilia's daughter, and to hear Cecilia tell her \"Ich Liebe Dich\". As Kiana and Cecilia venture into Babylon Tower to defeat the 2nd Herrscher, and it soon becomes apparent that Kiana is unable to differentiate that this is a data simulation, and that none of it is real due to Kiana's attachment with Cecilia. As both Cecilia and Kiana defeat the 2nd Herrscher, the two hug until Theresa appears and is about to take Kiana away, until Fu Hua appears.\n\nFu Hua brings Theresa away and tells Kiana the truth: everything she just experienced was not a virtual simulation, nor were they real at all; she has been standing in one place the whole time, and she has been living an illusion, a dream set up by the 2nd Herrscher within Kiana using Kiana's curiosity to her parents as her weakness. This news shocks Kiana upon realizing everything she experienced with her mother wasn't real, and collapsed into tears, telling Fu Hua to give her mother back. In this rage and confusion, Kiana remembers the magical words \"Ich Liebe Dich\" and constantly repeats it, allowing Kiana to use a portion of the Herrscher's powers and fight Fu Hua. Unfortunately, Kiana loses and Fu Hua brings her to Schicksal HQ. Theresa immediately orders to attack Schicksal HQ, along with allying with Anti-Entropy.\n\nKiana is then infused with an unimaginable amount of Honkai energy and the Gem of Serenity, which wakes the 2nd Herrscher who orders Benares to wake from the frost and snow of Siberia. Although Benares does delay Schicksal just a little bit, Schicksal still successfully gave time to the 2nd Herrscher to attain dominance over Kiana's body. Disabling all of Schicksal's defenses and finding Mei who fell off of Hyperion, Mei uses the power of the 3rd Herrscher to attempt and save Kiana from the 2nd Herrscher, however the 2nd Herrscher defeats Mei as the 2nd Herrscher is, much more powerful than the other Herrschers. Mei fails to defeat the 2nd Herrscher, and the Sirin unleashes her Honkai beasts and destroys Anti-Entropy's mechs with one snap of a finger.\n\nMei notes that the 2nd Herrscher radiated immense Honkai power, and is even more interesting as while other Herrschers would take time to transform into their Ascended form, the 2nd Herrscher immediately woke in her Ascended form. The Herrscher, unimpressed by Theresa, Bronya and Mei's forces, brings them into her void space to kill them one by one, proving all of their attacks futile with even the Oath of Judah unable to bind the Herrscher. Fu Hua comes to attack the Herrscher to give the girls and Theresa time to escape, however the 2nd Herrscher leaves Fu Hua injured, and chooses not to kill her, with Otto letting her leave, much to Fu Hua's dismay.\n\nFor four months the world suffered in despair, fear and pain as the 2nd Herrscher unleashed billions of Honkai beasts and destroyed cities and countries, with the survivors fleeing to whatever sanctuaries there were. The global Honkai Eruption was more devastating than any other up to that point.\n\nThe Herrscher meets Himeko with the Gem of Haste in Vermillion Knight on Hyperion, and the two fight. The Herrscher is enraged to see her own gem being used against her, and starts to monstrously attempt with nothing to stop her to kill Himeko. Just as she was about to kill Himeko, AE used the Selene on the Herrscher, which reduced her vast Honkai reserves to nothing but a flurry of heat. Before any of them could land a lasting blow on the Herrscher, the 2nd Herrscher escapes.\n\nHimeko, who easily defeats Benares after the 2nd Herrscher sends the dragon to attack Hyperion, is brought into the imaginary space where the Herrscher welcomes her to die. Although the Herrscher managed to severely injure Himeko, slicing her and even throwing the void at her, even the Herrscher could not compete with Himeko's determination and care for her student. In the end, the Herrscher defeats Himeko, only to realize Himeko has injected a Honkai neutralizing serum in her neck. Screeching an ear splitting scream of pain and agony, the 2nd Herrscher's imaginary space collapses and the 2nd Herrscher is put into a temporary slumber once more, however the Honkai eruption did not cease to spread.\n\nKiana washes over a shore where she wakes and sees the results of the 2nd Herrscher's awakening: a despairing world in the state of panic and suffering, and is now wanted with Rita Rosseweise being sent to capture her in Shicksal's name. As she traverses through Arc City, a metropolis sanctuary for the remaining refugees and survivors, she discovers the existence of World Serpent, an organization that has released Honkai in certain areas of the City.\n\nDuring her time in Arc City, she is constantly tormented with distress of being the catalyst of the world's devastation and even worse, the 2nd Herrscher wakes using Kiana's guilt over Himeko's death, and continues to gnaw at her weaknesses to regain control over her vessel again. While fighting a Honkai Beast, Kiana almost dies, where she is brought to an illusion constructed by the 2nd Herrscher, who reveals the terrifying truth while coaxing Kiana to join the 2nd Herrscher: everything about \"Kiana Kaslana\", a lie. Kiana Kaslana- no, K423, was only meant as a vessel for the 2nd Herrscher, made by a greedy human.\n\nIn her mental agony of realizing the truth, an illusion of Fu Hua appears thanks to the Feather of Fenghuang Down, which Kiana has been ignoring for three months, believing Fu Hua to be a spy and a traitor. Fu Hua and Kiana have a small exchange, where Fu Hua warns Kiana not to fight the Honkai, and Kiana, both stressed and angered, yells at Fu Hua, shunning her away and telling her to leave. Before Fu Hua leaves, Fu Hua asks Kiana to forgive her.\n\nKiana continues to fight the Honkai beasts, and laments over events in her life, remembering those she called her family and ended up hurting. Realizing she can't escape this fate and, weighed so heavily by guilt and meaninglessness to live, Kiana points the gun to her chin and just as she is about to pull the trigger, Fu Hua arrives, telling her now is not that time for despair, convincing her to live on.\n\nWhile fighting more Honkai Beasts, Kiana finds herself helpless and covers her head as the Sanctuary level Honkai Beasts head for her direction. Just as they do, a time fracture suddenly occurs, where Kiana meets an image of Himeko who walks past her and asks what she is waiting for. Gaining resolve to \"change this imperfect world into the one I want\", she masters a portion of the 2nd Herrscher's Void abilities, which contributes to Kiana's augmented core Void Drifter, where she is seen with one eye gold and one eye blue. Kiana accepts Fu Hua's help, and the two venture into Arc City.\n\nWhen playing as Kiana in Chapter 11 EX, there is an alternative ending if you let the Herrscher Charge fill where the Herrscher of the Void successfully gains control over Kiana's body and says \"the end of the Current Era is nigh\", implying that the Herrscher of the Void will proceed to destroy the rest of the world. However this is not the true ending and works more as a losing screen as you are allowed to play the stage again until you win.\n\nAfter Fu Hua saves Kiana, Fu Hua begins teaching Kiana how to defend herself against the Herrscher of the Void and grow stronger through using the 8th Key and creating a dream space. Here she learns how to use the Edge of Taixuan.\n\nTrivia\nKiana had a cat named Sora as a child.\nDuring chapter 23, she wore a wristband that monitored her condition. If there was a potential threat of Sirin taking over, a warning is given and Anti Entropy would be notified, with Kiana then teleporting to a safe location (if she is in control).\nIn animations, Kiana in her Herrscher of Flamescion form has three black diamonds hovering around her left shoulder (possibly referencing the Herrscher of Void's own translucent wings). These are not present in her in-game model or CGs.\nKiana is considered to be MIA following the events of the Great Eruption and up to A Post-Honkai Odyssey. This is a result of her battle alongside Mei and Bronya to stop Kevin and Project STIGMA, following which she stayed behind on the moon to seal the Honkai and allow the Earth time to heal."

Even before her father was arrested, she was used to silently accepting her loneliness within the home. When she went from being the center of attention at school to a \"criminal\", though, she grew more jaded. She still had a soft heart, but often put her guard up when people approached. This applied even to Kiana Kaslana.\n\nIt was only after Kiana innocently bombarded her with requests for food (despite her lack of skill at the time) that she began to soften again. This would be the start of her love for cooking.\n\nWhen Mei became the 3rd Herrscher, Mei's Herrscher personality woke. Mei's Herrscher personality was originally very malicious and cold: viewing those lower than her as scum. Her Herrscher personality could not only feel her pain, but also her joy (along with her feelings for Kiana). The Herrscher personality was touched when Kiana caught Mei from the edge of the school rooftop. However, both Mei and the Herrscher personality grew fearful of hurting Kiana and losing this precious bond. The Herrscher personality concealed herself within Mei to study Kiana in secret.\n\nAt St. Freya, Mei often took the role of a caretaker-- for both Kiana and the rest of the group. She would often cook for their little family, including packing lunches for her friends. She was always a good student, which carried over to her time in St. Freya. She scored in the top 3 for the first written tests they had to take.\n\nMei's Herrscher personality becomes kinder as time passes. She is willing to help Mei protect Kiana: fighting alongside Mei as Kiana's consciousness was overtaken by the 2nd Herrscher.\n\nEventually, Mei grows tired of her powerlessness. She no longer wanted to watch Kiana getting hurt without doing anything. Mei chooses to act on her feelings for once. She ascends as the Herrscher of Thunder, and leaves for World Serpent. Mei's personality then changes slightly. Despite being more cold and merciless than before, she is still kind. The only difference is that she has a new drive: the desire to protect Kiana. Even she admits that the fate that Ana Schariac and Owl suffered was not deserved, as she saw herself in Owl. She tries to keep a tough façade, but the concern she showed towards the two proves there's some empathy she can't help but show.\n\nWhen fighting the Herrscher of Domination she shows a more sadistic and taunting side, using the Herrscher's fear of her to her advantage-- purposely putting herself in the middle of their plans and significantly weakening them with her superior ability.\n\nRelationships\n\nRelationships\nKiana Kaslana\nKiana was Mei’s first real friend and helped pull her out of the darkness that loneliness brought her. When Mei awoke as a Herrscher, Kiana refused to abandon Mei or allow her to kill herself. Kiana promised Mei that she would protect her from the Herrscher within. Mei truly cares for Kiana, and takes extra care in watching over her. She is always worrying about Kiana, and often stays with her to make sure she doesn't get into trouble.\n\nKiana often declares her love for Mei in public, much to Mei's embarrassment. She reciprocates if it isn't an inappropriate time for it. When Kiana was captured by Schicksal, Mei could only think about how much she really cared for her. She specifically asked Theresa to disable the bomb next to her heart, despite the great fear she held for her power.\n\nMei tried her best, but was ultimately unable to do anything against the Herrscher of the Void. The Herrscher added insult to injury by taking the Gem of Conquest away from her. In the wake of the incident, the disappearance of both Kiana and Himeko left a huge impact on Mei. She began to see herself as weak, and unable to protect her loved ones. Mei chased any sign of Kiana, but when they finally met in Arc City, Kiana refused to return, fearing that she would harm her friends. Mei was shocked, and suddenly felt like Kiana was a stranger to her now. She could only watch as Kiana risked her life yet again to save the city, and was intercepted when trying to catch her. Durandal beat her to it.\n\nMei fought with all her might, but failed to even scratch the S-Rank Valkyrie. She attempted to pursue her afterwards, but could only fall to the ground in exhaustion. She wept at her helplessness alone in the middle of the street. After days of searching, Mei found Kiana at the brink of death in Nagazora. Mei was unable to sleep due to her anxiety. Nevertheless, she put on a smile for Kiana, and didn't say anything when she realized Kiana had been lying to her about her wellbeing. After overhearing Kiana tell the doctors to kill her if they have to, she decided to accept Kevin's offer to join World Serpent.\n\nThe final nail in the coffin was when Kiana blatantly said she didn't care if she died. Mei chased after her again, but ultimately realized that she needed to fight. She embraced her Herrscher powers and emerged with a firm heart. Kiana refused to let her go with Kevin, and so they fought. It was in this fight that Mei was finally honest, and said that the world meant nothing to her if Kiana wasn't in it. Kiana was unable to defeat the newly awakened Herrscher, and fell unconscious. Mei gently sat her against the rubble and left.\n\nBronya Zaychik\nMei and Kiana ran into Bronya in Nagazora. Mei immediately took her under her wing as a little sister of sorts. She treated Bronya like a human, not a weapon. Bronya had actually been deployed to capture Mei after her awakening, but decided to join Kiana and Mei on their journey. While at first it was only to monitor the two, Mei's care opened Bronya's heart up. Over time, Bronya genuinely came to enjoy her company, and they peacefully lived their days at St. Freya.\n\nIn the incident with the 4th Herrscher, Bronya was forced to capture Mei and Wendy. When the time came to face Kiana and the others, she asked them to take Mei and leave. Bronya burnt the biochip in her brain to give them the opportunity to escape. It impacted her enough to put her in a coma. Mei was devastated, and constantly fretted over her in the hospital. Despite learning the truth about Bronya, Mei still cared for her dearly.\n\nAfter the incident with the Herrscher of the Void, Mei and Bronya were separated, with Mei going to look for Kiana and Bronya heading for the underwater Anti-Entropy base. The two haven't interacted since.\n\n--\n\nDurandal\nMei first meets Durandal in Arc City. When she desperately attempted to take back the unconscious Kiana, she was confronted with the S-Rank Valkyrie and lost. Durandal states that Mei's ability lacks in comparison to her will. Durandal then takes Kiana away. This moment begins a series of events that would place Mei on a path leading towards World Serpent. When the two meet again on Coral Island, they agree to work together against a common enemy. When the Herrscher breaks loose, Mei and Durandal work together to subdue it. The two are shown to have a mutual respect for the other's ability.\n\n--\n\nRaven\nThe two meet as enemies, with Raven attempting to kill Kiana multiple times. In Nagazora, the two begin an uneasy truce to deal with Benares and get the orphans out of the ruins. When the truce ends the two battle. Raven at first believed that Mei is a weakling due to her losing her Herrscher powers, however Mei manages to muster strength from the residual power still within her. This turns the fight in her favor and Raven backs off to allow Mei to retrieve Kiana. Raven tells World Serpent that Mei could be a viable member.\n\nAfter Mei becomes a member, she suddenly treats Raven with as much coldness as anyone else. Even so, she is shown to worry about Raven when she is wounded by Owl. Raven is shown to trust Mei enough to go along with her secret plan. When the two are seen again in the Herrscher of Domination arc, they are much closer, with them stopping in at Raven's bar for a drink before visiting the orphanage together. They also share personal stories during a car ride and a walk on the beach. Their trust in battle is also shown when they are both dragged into the Theater of Domination.\n\n--\n\nElysia\nAfter Mei is recruited by Kevin to join World Serpent, Kevin sends her to the Elysian Realm, telling her that the Realm contains information regarding the nature of the Honkai. Upon entering the Realm, Mei is greeted by a simulation of Elysia, who introduces herself to Mei as the 2nd of the Previous Era's Thirteen Flame-Chasers, and that the Elysian Realm is a digital space hosting the simulated memories of those thirteen.\n\nMei is initially very wary of Elysia. This is due to her unusually cheerful and seemingly pure demeanour. This wariness is exacerbated as Mei meets more of the Flame-Chasers, who each have their own opinions about Elysia. One of which is Mobius, who openly labels Elysia as a “Traitor”.\n\nHowever, as Mei ventures deeper into the Realm, she comes to realise that the pure cheerfulness Elysia exudes is her nature. She begins to open up more to Elysia. At the end of the Elysian Realm's 3rd chapter, Elysia reveals to Mei that she is in fact the 13th Herrscher of the Previous Era. Despite that, the two remain strongly bonded. This is seen as Mei is actively involved in the search for Elysia after the latter is seemingly killed in Chapter 29 of the main story.\n\nThe two meet again for the last time in Chapter 31 after Eden reveals to Mei that Elysia was never the 13th Herrscher. Through Eden, Mei finds out that Elysia was born a Herrscher, and was actually the very first Herrscher to have existed. Mei finally meets Elysia in her Herrscher form and understands that Elysia’s sacrifice in the Previous Era yielded in her existence as a Herrscher who fought for humanity. The two bid farewell as Mei returns to the real world.\n\nHistory\n\nOn April 13th, 1997, Raiden Ryoma and his wife gave birth to Mei in Nagazora City (Honshu, Japan). A few years later, her mother died of cancer. The year she died is not specified. Later, her stigmata awoke, and Ryoma sealed it as best he could. Some terrorist organization kidnapped her in 2004, and it isn't clear how Ryoma got her back.\n\nMei underwent 3 years of therapy afterwards.\n\nOtherwise, Mei lived a cushy life. Servants would prepare her lunches, everyone showered her in attention, and even with her father often gone for business, she had kendo lessons with Mr. HOMU (who was actually her father) to keep her busy. Life was beautiful. Then, all of a sudden, everything changed. Her father was falsely accused of embezzling funds by Cocolia, and was put in prison in 2013. Ryoma had told her a strong heart is what will get you through battle. She thought her heart was the strongest, but when everything collapsed before her very eyes, she knew she was wrong. The ME Corp assets were frozen, and she no longer had servants to help her get by. This is when Cocolia took over the corporation herself.\n\nAt first, Mei's cooking was awful, as she had never cooked a meal in her life. This time, when she asked her classmates to sit with her, they rejected her. No one wanted to hang out with a \"criminal's daughter\" after all. She realized that because she was no longer an heiress, no one cared about her. All their enthusiasm was for their own benefit. Mei found the Mr. HOMU costume in the training room, and realized her father had been training her all along. Alone, she could not handle the hatred threatening to engulf her. Then, Kiana Kaslana came into her life. Despite Mei being cautious towards this underclassman, Kiana managed to worm her way into her heart. She defended Mei from bullies, ate lunch with her, and gave her more than she had ever experienced before. Mei finally found a real friend. Kiana's enthusiasm for Mei's homemade lunch started a long love for cooking. Mei realized cooking was no longer simply to survive. Kiana told her it didn't matter what her father may or may not have done. She was Mei, and only Mei. The two found solace in each other.\n\nThey lived peacefully until the Gem of Conquest was stimulated in Nagazora in 2014. This gem awoke the hidden powers in Mei's stigmata long sealed away. The burst of Honkai energy that arose from her eruption turned almost every citizen into zombies. Kiana was not affected by the Honkai poisoning that plagued everyone else. At that point, another personality took control over Mei: one that hated humanity, and that was much more violent than the mellow friend Kiana had made. Even so, Kiana did not waver, and beat the personality back, allowing Mei to come to her senses. When Mei awoke, she looked on in horror at what she had done, and tried to jump off of the very roof the battle took place. Kiana reached out her hand and told her not to give up. Even after Mei exhausted all of the worries she had, Kiana still urged her to take her hand. Mei took it, and thus her fate was changed.\n\nThere is another version of her awakening that Mihoyo has told. Everything is the same except Mei chooses to ascend as the 3rd Herrscher in an act of revenge against all those who harmed her. In this version, Kiana meets Mei as the Herrscher personality. Even though this personality has many chances to kill Kiana, she doesn't. Kiana is still as stubborn as before, and keeps insisting she will save Mei from herself. Eventually, the Herrscher personality grows scared of her kindness and decides to end her life. Kiana reaches out for the Herrscher, and she accepts her defeat. Mei awakens, and begs Kiana to let go, but Kiana refuses. Just like the other version, Mei ends up taking her hand.\n\nThe two headed off to explore the city and find a way to survive. During this time, Mei still had doubts welling up within her, and told Kiana to leave her behind. Kiana refused, and promised Mei if she ever lost herself to that personality again, she would beat her as many times as it takes. Mei called her an idiot, but she was comforted by those words. Soon they met Bronya Zaychik, and the three kept wandering until a few months later.\n\nManga Story\nSecond Eruption\nMei briefly appears as a baby crying in her mother's arms as she watches a news report on a television screen in a city.\n\nEscape from Nagazora\nIn the midst of a Honkai attack, Kiana took a fatal blow for Mei, which caused her other personality to take control. The Herrscher personality made it clear that she wanted to kill Kiana herself, so she wouldn't let her die here. Schicksal, having already noticed the spike in Honkai energy, sent the battleship Hyperion to check out the situation. Among the crew was Murata Himeko. The two fought each other for only a little bit of time before Mei managed to heavily damage the battleship. Right when she was on the cusp of winning, the Kaslana in her arms woke up. To everyone's surprise, she shattered the wings of the Herrscher, thus putting that personality to rest once more.\n\nThe three girls were taken onto the Hyperion, and were offered the chance to be Schicksal Valkyries. At first, Mei opposed the idea, as she thought the Herrscher power inside her was too dangerous: if she were to be taken over again, the results would be catastrophic. She asked Himeko to simply kill her and get rid of the problem, but Himeko refused. She told Mei that if she's willing to give up her life, she should give it to saving people. Schicksal planted a bomb next to Mei's heart: one that would explode if her Herrscher powers were used for more than 5 minutes. This made Mei feel safer about attending.\n\nAE Invasion\nCocolia from Anti-Entropy wanted Mei's power, so she sent one of her clones of Welt Joyce to kidnap her. Neither Bronya nor Fu Hua could stop him, but Kiana swooped in just in time. Mei's Herrscher persona lent Kiana her power, and thus made the Moonlight Empress battlesuit, an alternate version of the Knight Moonbeam battlesuit. The two of them defeated the clone, and he ran off.\n\nIn this part of the story we learn that Mei's Herrscher personality actually cares about Kiana, and is afraid of hurting her. However, the Herrscher would never admit it out loud, and keeps up a mask of aggression.\n\nGame Story\nThe girls were on a mission to investigate and find the control room of a battleship named Selene that was flying over a big city. Shortly after Kiana and Mei met up on the aircraft, a Honkai beast Kiana thought she had defeated came back to fight. Kiana was injured, and Mei held off the beast with her sword. Desperate to save Kiana and herself, she let her other personality take over.\n\nThe stress on her body was too much, and she collapsed soon after.\n\nMei, Kiana, and Bronya headed to the first destination on their list: New Zealand, where the Gem of Desire was located. As it turns out, they met a girl named Wendy, who had the gem implanted in one of her legs in a similar fashion to Mei's own implant. The only difference is that the Honkai energy left her unable to walk, and that caused her to hate Schicksal, thus leading to her awakening as the Herrscher of Wind. The girls tried their best to fight her off, but during the battle, Anti Entropy titans (sent by Cocolia) came and subdued both Mei and Wendy. They took off with the two girls, Bronya assisting them (not by her own will).\n\nMei was kept hostage in the ME Corp, and is saved by Bronya, who destroyed the bio chip in her brain to stop following Cocolia's orders. When she wakes up, she was shocked to find Bronya in critical condition, and fights off the MSR-7 Wotan with Kiana, Theresa Apocalypse, and Murata Himeko.\n\nMei mostly stayed by Bronya's side, watching over her recovery. She rested for a while, but was awoken to the news of Kiana's capture. Once Kiana was confirmed to be captured by Schicksal, she and the Hyperion crew defected from the organization. The bomb was disabled per her request. She was exhausted, but remarked that she could only think of Kiana as she fought her way through the Schicksal defenses. Mei tried to fight the Herrscher of the Void (HoV), but to no avail. HoV ripped the Conquest gem from her body and nearly killed her in the process.\n\nNext, the crew of Hyperion, including the newly aligned Anti Entropy, set off for Arc City. There they were supposed to meet Grey Serpent, an intel dealer, for news of Kiana's whereabouts. Mei encountered Rita Rossweisse, who had taken out the dealer prior to their landing. She tried to fight her off, but had to run away, as she was too strong of an opponent. They couldn't find Kiana.\n\nAfter the events in Arc City, Dr. Einstein and Dr. Nikola Tesla (Anti Entropy leaders) informed the group that there were two options to take. One was to continue searching for Kiana, and the other was to head to the Anti Entropy base in the Pacific Ocean to retrieve the Gem of Desire. They ended up deciding to do both. Despite Mei wanting to talk to Cocolia about her kidnappings, she decided she would rather go look for Kiana. Einstein, Theresa, and Bronya would go to the base, while Tesla and Mei headed to Anti Entropy headquarters to repair the Ningyo that they found in Arc City. After completing their first task, Mei and Tesla headed back to Arc City to look for Kiana.\n\nMei found Rita, who was gathering intel in Heliopolis. With her blade to Rita's neck, she demanded to know where Kiana was located. She also took back the eye Rita cut out of Gray Serpent. This would be useful for the Ningyo's reawakening. Once she got what she wanted, she immediately rushed to Kiana.\n\nIn the basement of Heliopolis, the two reunited. Mei rushed to embrace her, but Kiana's quiet resolve shook Mei to her core. Kiana explained that she didn't want to put anyone in danger, and that she would not be leaving with her. They headed outside, where Mei got injured by Raven. Mei watched as Kiana beat Raven, but spared her life. Then, she could only watch as Kiana defused the bomb and fell from the sky. Durandal, who had caught Kiana with the powers of the Sixth Divine Key (Abyss Flower), obliterated Mei in the fight for Kiana. She burst off into the distance and Mei chased her, but to no avail. Mei, exhausted and weak, could only cling to Kiana's jacket as she watched her be taken away. Feelings of uselessness swelled in her heart as she cried.\n\nAbout three days after the incident, Mei and Tesla caught a strong Honkai signal from Nagazora. Believing it to be Kiana, they arrived as fast as they could. In the midst of their search for Kiana, they stumbled upon Sora, who led them to her home. There, Mei learned there were actually survivors in Nagazora, and that they had someone looking after them. Sora talked about that person's impact on her, and how she was given a reason to go on by her kindness. Mei reminisced in the past, opening up to Sora about Kiana's importance to her. Sora said it sounded like Kiana was like her own teacher was to her. That teacher ended up being Raven, who saved the two from Benares.\n\nFor Mei, the 4 months before she found Kiana had brought her to the realization that she hadn't changed. She was still the weak girl who couldn't do anything. She was the one who wasn't strong enough to protect her loved ones. After a confrontation with Raven, her Herrscher powers arose, despite not having the gem within her. Raven backed off, telling her to go get Kiana before she changed her mind. Mei finally found Kiana, but Honkai poisoning had worked its way all over her body: she was on the brink of death.\n\nTesla managed to successfully save her, but told Mei that Kiana only had two more months to live. Kiana's pain, and the revelation she was going to die, made Mei unable to sleep. She stayed awake until Kiana finally woke up. Mei pushed down her fears and walked into the medical bay, only to see Kiana looking up at her. Despite how happy she was to see her, Mei also scolded Kiana for running away and not even telling them where she was. Kiana tried to lighten up conversation with a compliment, but eventually apologized. Mei informed Kiana of everything that had happened these past 4 months. After a bit of chatting, Kiana said she wanted to go outside. Mei reluctantly accepted and let her go, but also made sure to come along. The two went for a walk around Nagazora, and chatted about their previous travelling through the city. They bickered back and forth, but eventually the mood became serious. Kiana told her that she was K-423, and Mei told her it didn't matter. No matter what, she and the others would stay by her side.\n\nAfterwards, Tesla and Einstein told Mei what their thoughts were on the matter: as Kiana's problem is Sirin herself, they cannot do anything to cure or prevent her death. Basically, it would be up to Kiana alone. Einstein said for now, they wanted to move her to a base and prepare for the worst. Mei asked for elaboration, and Einstein did not answer, but the silence answered for her. They would have to kill Kiana if worst came to worst. Sora arrived right afterward, wanting to say goodbye to Mei, but Mei couldn't muster up the will to smile at her. Feeling bad, she walked Sora back to the Nest, where Raven said World Serpent had a way to cure Kiana's condition, and to come back alone in two hours if she was interested.\n\nLater on, she overheard Tesla and Einstein talking to Kiana about her condition. Kiana expressed immense regret for the hurt she had caused everyone, but especially Mei. She said she took everything Mei had wanted away from her. She asked the doctors to not let her friends come near her if things went south, and that she didn't want to cause them any more grief. Mei could only shed a tear; Kiana had been putting on a mask for her.\n\nMei's despair swelled when Kiana lied to her about being able to taste the curry she made for her. The one she wanted to help would not even rely on her, so she took matters into her own hands. She met Raven at the Nest and then met Kevin Kaslana. He told her if she became the true Herrscher of Thunder, she would be able to give Kiana more time to live. He told her she would not lose herself this time. Kevin added that he has seen people like Kiana before, and that she would never stop trying to be a hero. He said the only true way to save her was by joining World Serpent and stopping the threats before Kiana could. Mei agreed to his offer.\n\nA while later, she woke up in the streets and ran into Kiana, who was covered in wounds. Kiana told Mei to head back to Helios. She stated that she wanted to use her void powers to close the portal in the sky, and Mei tried to tell her off, but Kiana said she didn't care if she died. Mei looked on in horror as Kiana summoned Benares to fly to the source of the Honkai energy, with Mei left chasing her once again. After running wildly through the city, Mei stumbled upon a wounded Benares, with a sword impaling it. Nihilus, the creature that owned said sword, proceeded to fight her. Although it took forever to defeat, and Mei was heavily injured, she won against it. Suddenly, though, it turned back time and came back. It charged at Mei, and swung its sword down onto her. Benares took the blow, and died in the process. Mei fell unconscious.\n\nThis is when she entered a place familiar to her. A void with only purple light. She knew where she was. Her Herrscher personality was surprised Mei came to her first, and asked if she was sure she wanted to become the real Herrscher of Thunder. Mei was resolved. She would save Kiana. Thus, she took up her power alone: the Conquest gem leaving Kiana and transferring into her strength. She took the remains of Benares, creating a new life and renaming it Kurikara. Mei fought Kiana when she refused to let her go with Kevin. When Kiana began to use the powers that were killing her, Mei beat her down quickly. Mei explained it wasn't right for Kiana to suffer in silence, dying for her heroism. Kiana dismissed it, saying this was simply her mission. With an exclamation of her true feelings, Mei broke the lances surrounding her and chased after Kiana. She was quick enough to catch up to her this time. She defeated her and left with World Serpent.\n\nTrivia\nHer family name (Raiden) is a reference to the Shinto god of lightning, thunder, and storms (Raijin)."

          "content": "Bronya Zaychik (full name Bronya Alexeievna Zaychik) is a protagonist of the series along with Kiana Kaslana and Raiden Mei. She is a member of the St. Freya team and a former Valkyrie of Schicksal Squad V. She is also Welt Yang's successor as the Herrscher of Reason.\n\nAppearance\nBronya is a short young girl and has light gray hair and darker gray eyes.

She also has black shorts, and gray and yellow prosthesis legs with what appears to be built in \"boots\" as part of the prosthetic.\nWolf’s Dawn: Bronya wears black-brown ribbons with white polka dots on her hair, a dark brown jacket with yellow cuffs and silver clasps, and an orange vest beneath it with gold buttons and a brown gold-buckled belt. Beneath the vest she wears a white collared shirt with black stripes with a large yellow bow with a silver decal in the middle tied into the shirt's collar. She also has white gloves on her hands, as well as brown shorts over gray and yellow prosthesis legs.\nYamabuki Armor: Bronya wears yellow ribbons with black outlines on her hair, a one-piece yellow, black and silver garment with a white collar with a yellow HOMU doll head on it, black, white, yellow and silver gloves and white and black prosthesis legs.\nDrive Kometa: Bronya wears red, black and white accessories on her hair, a white dress with numerous black and red embellishments, black and red gloves and red stockings with a black pattern on it over her prosthesis legs.\nDimension Breaker: Bronya wears\nBlack Nucleus: Bronya wears\nHerrscher of Reason: Bronya wears\nHerrscher of Truth: Bronya wears\nHaxxor Bunny: The appearance of her alternate universe self, Bronie. She wears\nSilverwing: N-EX: The appearance of Bronya far into the future. She wears\nHistory\nBorn some time in the year 2000, Bronya’s parents are both presumed dead, with her father's having been confirmed earlier. Somehow ending up in the hands of Russian gangs, Bronya was forced to become a sniper.\n\nPersonality\nBronya is emotionally stunted as a result of Project X-10, speaking in a deadpan tone with a matching expression. Bronya rarely shows empathy or acts in accordance with others. Despite this, she adores both the HOMU franchise and Seele, and sympathises with Wendy. When she became the Herrscher of Reason, the Core of Reason repaired both her legs and brain, allowing her to walk and feel the emotions she had lost. She has a grown-up personality, and a very logical way of thinking, although she has trouble understanding concepts based on intuition, which is what Kiana often acts upon.\n\nShe refers to herself in the third person as \"The Bronya\" and often refers to others as \"subject\", with the only exceptions being Seele and Mei. She can be quite competitive when it comes to what she is passionate about, particularly video games. While she takes pleasure in defeating an overconfident Kiana, she is seen on one occasion to purposely let Mei win.\n\nBronya is attached to Mei, seeing her as an older sister, and remarks on how Mei is one of the only people who truly accepted her. She loves Mei enough to sacrifice her life for her, as seen when she burns the bio-chip in her brain to avoid hurting Mei.\n\nBronya cares for Seele greatly, as shown when she sacrifices herself in the Sea of Quanta to allow Seele to escape. Their relationship is hinted to have romantic undertones, as Seele kisses Bronya in the Azure Waters manga. Bronya sticks to her promise to protect Seele and take her to the sea, the two being shown to deeply trust each other.\n\nManga Story\nAzure Waters\nOn a mission to kill Cocolia, all of the gang members were wiped out except Bronya. She awoke in Cocolia's Orphanage, being told that Cocolia doesn’t kill kids. Bronya was quickly adopted into the family, and had a close relationship with a girl named Seele Vollerei. The two had even promised to go to the beach together.\n\nBronya showed great promise with Honkai adaptability, making a girl named Sin Mal become jealous and break Bronya’s legs. However, Bronya didn’t turn her in.\n\nWhen Seele was kidnapped by another Russian gang, Bronya staged a one-woman raid, and killed everyone, setting her reputation as the ‘Silver Wolf of the Urals’ in stone.\n\nBronya was going to take the X-10 test, but to protect her, Seele took it in her place. However, she disappeared, causing Bronya to demand to take it as well. During the test, Bronya briefly appeared in the quantum state where Seele was. Bronya knew this wasn't something she could return from unharmed. She wanted to stay with Seele, even if that meant her own death. Seele refused to let her do so; she told Bronya that she was strong, the strongest person in her life. Seele urged her to leave, saying she was her only hope of return. Bronya pinky-promised to look for a way to take Seele out of there, and that she’d never give up. Before Bronya had to leave, Seele gave her a “gift” from the previous civilization — a mecha Bronya named “Project Bunny” that followed her every command. She kissed Bronya, saying she would have to return it when they meet again.\n\nUpon exiting the test, Bronya was in much worse condition though: due to her legs being broken and her extended amount of time in the X-10 trial, Bronya was left without the use of her legs and the destruction of her limbic system, leaving her without the ability to feel emotion. She now needed prosthetics to walk.\n\nEscape from Nagazora\nBronya was sent to capture Raiden Mei, after Cocolia unleashed her stigma in 2014.\n\nAfter joining both Mei and her traveling partner Kiana Kaslana, she ended up following them onto the Hyperion and to St. Freya Academy.\n\nSt. Freya High\nAfter arriving at St. Freya, Bronya agreed to enroll. During Kiana Kaslana’s studying, Bronya assisted her with a virtual reality simulation showing Kallen Kaslana’s execution. While they attempted to save her, they failed.\n\nAE Invasion\nBronya tried to stop one of the Joyce Welt clone, but was defeated after Project Bunny was destroyed. It’s unknown how it got fixed.\n\nGame Story\nTrivia\nThe pronunciation of her name in Chinese sounds similar to the word 板鸭 bǎnyā, meaning \"salted duck.\"\nBronya's favorite toy is her HOMU plush.\nIn Cooking with Valkyries, Bronya is revealed to have a secret stash of canned beef under her bed to use as emergency rations.\nIn the Summer Memories event storyline, Bronya is known to possess over 1 million gold in stock due to her superior stock-trading skills and her purchase of miHoYo from Liu Wei."

Honkai corresponds to the advancement of that civilization, meaning that the more it progresses, the more Honkai progresses as well. The force behind Honkai is the Will of Honkai.\n\nIn the larger scheme of things, Honkai is a form of natural selection, \"pruning\" weak worlds from the branches of the Imaginary Tree, to ensure that only strong worlds survive.\n\nIn truth, Honkai was not exactly a test to remove weak worlds from the branches of the Imaginary Tree, with the weak worlds sinking to the bottom of the Sea of Quanta. One interpretation of what Honkai is, given by Tesla and Kevin, is that Honkai is a \"test\" for humanity to evolve enough for the Finality to \"embrace\" through trial and error. In this context, \"embrace\" means that humanity and civilization assimilate into the Finality, which will then seek out other worlds in the Imaginary Tree and force other worlds to assimilate into it. Dr. MEI speculates that the Finality is some sort of higher being, a higher civilization, or a higher existence, though it has no tangible form. Instead, it projects itself as a \"Cocoon\" into the Honkai universe.\n\nIn Chapter 33, Kevin reveals to Fu Hua the truth about Earth's civilization and the truth of the Finality: The Finality's true power is time. Using its powers, the planet becomes trapped in a 50,000-year reincarnation time loop. After 50,000 years have passed and the \"embrace\" fails, the Final Herrscher will reset the world—and civilization—back to the beginning to try again.\n\nRegarding bubble universes, in Chapter 32, Dr. MEI states that when the world is reset, the power of the Finality creates bubble universes based on the influence of the world it resets.

It is the origin of life itself, as all universes and bubble worlds are born there.\n\nSummary\nThe Imaginary Tree emerged from Sea of Quanta. Since the Imaginary Tree and Sea Of Quanta are alone in the universe, they have an unending rivalry. The Sea Of Quanta swells while the Imaginary Tree extends its roots. The Sea Of Quanta wants to flood the Tree. Meanwhile, the Imaginary Tree wants to absorb the Sea.\n\nThe Tree has drank from the Sea, endured an asamkhya (innumerable amount of time), and grown a nayuta (numerical unit of one hundred billion or ten million) of branches and leaves. During this seemingly endless time, a branch grew a new bud. This was the birth of human civilization. Time flows in the trunk of the Imaginary Tree and branches out into an infinity of worlds. Every branch is a form of civilization, while every bud is their past and present etched onto the dimension of time. Each twig is a world line and each leaf is a bubble universe."

The Tree wishes to absorb the Sea, while the Sea wishes to drown the Tree. In order to facilitate this cycle, worlds \"grow\" as leaves of the Tree, and when they fail to persist, \"fall\" from the Tree and into the Sea. These worlds become fragmented versions of themselves, called bubble universes, with some having more stability than others.\n\nMore On Bubble Universes\nThe Sea of Quanta is a place that doesn't follow contemporary rules. Some people's memories are enough to create entirely new bubble universes, as was the case with the one Kevin Kaslana created to \"teach\" Seele Vollerei in Chapter 12, Plain of Vigrid. Some can be artificially created, such as the bubble universe Durandal and Rita visit. It was created by mankind in the Previous Era, and maintains stability through its Ether Anchor.\n\nEther Anchor\nSimply put, an Ether Anchor is what tethers and holds a bubble universe together.

            "Honkai Energy"
          ],
          "content": "The Honkai: A Cosmic Force\n\nThe Honkai is a cosmic force of nature that permeates the shared multiverse of Honkai Impact 3rd.\nHonkai Energy is the primary byproduct of all Honkai manifestations across the universes. Sufficient concentrations of Honkai Energy radiation can cause various adverse effects on all living beings, particularly those with human intellect. While the required concentrations vary from person to person due to innate resistance to Honkai, a successful infection is referred to as Honkai Corruption.\nHonkai as a Universal Energy System\nHonkai Energy is used by all combatants in the universe and aids them in many ways. The section below explains how Honkai Energy qualifies as a Universal Energy System. And given its feats and mechanics, the following abilities are granted by default to any user: Energy Absorption, Stat Amplification, and Damage Increase.\n\nUniversal Usage\n\nHonkai Energy is used by everything in the setting, from reactors, vehicles, mechs, and civilizations, to individuals who can freely manipulate it, be it Valkyries through their stigmas, MANTIS and Honkai beasts through the Honkai in their genes, and Herrschers through their cores and bodies filled with Honkai Energy. In addition, individuals with resistance to Honkai can also manipulate it.\nIt boosts all abilities, from battlesuits, weapons, and powers, some examples are: Honkai Energy being used to manipulate matter, Kiana/Sirin using Honkai Energy to cause spatial curvatures, Ana Schariac using Honkai Energy for her ice manipulation, Herrscher of Sentience's illusions releasing Honkai Energy, Honkai beasts using Honkai Energy to create acid storms.\n\nEmpowerment\n\nHonkai Energy and its users have demonstrated several feats in terms of amplification, be it increasing the user's physique, speed, or abilities, both passively and actively.\nExamples of passive strengthening are the enhancements received by Valkyries through their stigmata, making their body one of the best vessels for Honkai Energy, MANTIS through the genes of Honkai beasts increasing their strength and speed, with the strongest MANTIS as Flame-Chasers reaching Herrscher levels, with the latter also having Honkai Energy within their bodies.\nIt is also possible to absorb Honkai Energy, something noted as possible for all Valkyrie, to strengthen both one's physique and abilities in the process. Supplying more Honkai Energy causes enhanced resistances to be bypassed, and has also increased the potency of matter manipulation from atomic to subatomic. Additionally, Swara, the Edge of Taixuan, is capable of not only strengthening the body, but also launching attacks, and works by supplying more Honkai Energy. Honkai Energy also enhances battlesuits and melee weapons such as swords, which also empower the wielder in the process, or firearms such as pistols. Deterioration The reverse of the above is also true, with several demonstrations of users losing their strength, speed, failing to use their powers, and even dying. For starters, there is an anti-Honkai serum, which is capable of deactivating Honkai Energy; this serum was able to weaken a Honkai beast, resulting in its inability to control Honkai Energy, which caused its death. Valkyries also lost their ability to use Honkai, and were reduced to human levels of strength. Zombies went into a state of panic and rage, and even lost consciousness.\nLosing or having less Honkai Energy causes the user to become slower, affecting both their travel speed, reaction speed, and attack speed, while a lack of Honkai Energy causes powers to fail.\nThe Nature of Honkai\nThe mechanisms and abilities by which Honkai Energy works and how it manifests in the world, which can be actively used depending on the user's Honkai adaptability. Honkai Energy innately possesses the following abilities:\n* Information Manipulation (Type 2), Higher Dimensional Manipulation and Chaos Manipulation (Honkai is a force of chaos, its origin being a phenomenon that emanates from the Imaginary Space, capable of destabilizing it and having a strong interrelation with information, allowing it to increase and decrease the entropy of systems, which is described as informational asymmetries between chaotic and ordered information, expressing it through higher dimensional functions. Additionally, Honkai composes all the fundamental information of the Stigmata)\n* Non-Physical Interaction (Spirits, Incorporeality, Memories, Dreams, Empathy, Limited Data, Abstract Thoughts, Information (Type 2), Concept (Type 1) and Non-existence (Nature Type 1); Can interact with Honkai Energy, as well as with Higokumaru, who is a spirit. Void Beings/Quantum States that are part of from the Sea of Quanta that exists as imaginary possibilities and concepts, the dreamscape, a blank space of nothingness and information that is said to be a higher-dimensional concept. They are also a projection of it, which are born from the cognition of emotions, desires, memories, and thoughts, as they are formless and non-corporeal, they are incapable of being harmed by any conventional real-world attack. Furthermore, Honkai energy can also interact with Stigma spaces, being the same as the Imaginary Space, a realm that is absolute nothingness, a void without any meaning or common sense, devoid of time being the opposite of reality; and affect the internal data of computers. Furthermore, it is stated that Honkai Energy is even more effective on non-physical entities than on physical ones)\n\nStandard Effects\n\nHonkai Energy causes corruption to everything it comes into contact with and brings about several negative effects just by its exposure and nature, which are listed below:\n\n* Corruption (Types 1 and 2; Honkai is a corrupting force, capable of corrupting humans and animals, even Valkyries, inherently resistant to Honkai Energy due to their stigmas, can succumb to its influences. Corruption can spread by touching weapons energized with Honkai Energy, or through exposure and non-physical contact, the consequences of a successful infection are also diverse, ranging from victims transforming into a partial or even complete Honkai beast, creatures devoid of intelligence, driven solely by the instinct to gather under the command of the Herrschers. It can also induce zombification in individuals and, at its peak, transform them into Herrschers, being potent enough to impact even individuals like Kiana Kaslana, who through sheer force of will, mastered her Herrscher powers, powers that were effectively corroding her mind and even capable of possessing her, and yet her supernatural willpower was useless against Honkai infections. Honkai also has a corrupting effect on entities devoid of biological bodies, such as mechs or even those that lack a tangible physical form, such as the disembodied consciousness of the Herrscher of Sentience)\n* Biological Manipulation, Empathic Manipulation, and Disease Manipulation (Lower levels of Honkai infection can cause brain damage, and infected areas become incapacitated, such as Bronya's leg, which required an exoskeleton prosthesis to function after the X-10 experiment. Said infection was able to affect her emotions, such as removing joy, sadness, emotional centers, and emotions in general. Honkai also acts like a disease, capable of transmission by mere exposure, causing multiple organ failure, such as acute heart failure, and has a 100% mortality rate despite medical efforts)\n* Mental Manipulation, Soul Manipulation, Information Manipulation (Type 2), and Conceptual Manipulation (Type 1; Honkai Energy can control people by inducing mental corruption, infecting both the mind, their ego, and merging with the consciousness. Welt Yang was intrigued to realize that Bronya's mind was still human despite having corrupted her, and people who are corrupted to a certain degree Herrscher's characters also have to fight for their minds and bodies against the Herrscher persona. A person's mind is considered their soul and is composed of fundamental information, the latter of which shapes reality and life like a line of code, being conceptual in nature)\n* Madness Manipulation (Types 1 and 2; Honkai Energy can drive people insane, compelling them to engage in aggressive behavior, including attacking each other. Kiana, having her mind corrupted and eroded by the Herrscher corruption, is described as breaking free from impending insanity upon releasing it; additionally, Honkai Energy also causes loss of sanity and sense of self)\n* Corrosion Induction (Honkai is a phenomenon and condition that disintegrates and corrodes the composition of all materials, being able to induce corrosion in objects and erode structural integrity)\n* Perception Manipulation (Honkai infections cause major sensory loss, impacting vision, causing blurriness and compromising visual clarity. Tesla, after being infected by Honkai Energy, also began to hallucinate)\n* Energy Manipulation (Sufficient Honkai Energy can cause people to suffocate, vaporize, or even die upon contact)\n* Necromancy (Honkai corruption has the ability to revive corpses as zombies)\n* Life Manipulation (Honkai can corrode the life of a life form)\n* Limited Memory Manipulation (Honkai infections are capable of causing memory loss and deterioration)\n* Limited Pain Manipulation (Being injected with Honkai Energy induces pain and a burning sensation within the body)\n* Limited Age Manipulation (Honkai has negative effects on lifespan, such as reduced lifespan and premature mortality)\n\nHonkai Energy Manipulation\nThis section is dedicated to explaining and assigning the powers, abilities, scaling, and mastery of each user type. These abilities most often need to be actively used by the user. \n\nLow-Level Manipulation\nThose with a resistance to Honkai Energy, such as Valkyries, most Blade Mantra users, Artificial Stigma users, and common MANTIS soldiers can exert some level of control over it when trained, granting them the use of its standard effects and a low level of manipulation over it.\nSkills and Resistances\n* Energy Absorption, Stat Amplification, and Damage Increase (Honkai Energy can be used and absorbed to strengthen and energize the body, increase the user's speed, enhance weapons such as pistols, swords, and armor, both passively, as in the natural enhancements received by Valkyries through the stigmata, incorporated into their own physiology and used since the Previous Era or MANTIS soldiers, and actively, as in the users of the Blade Mantra of the Taixuan Edge, in addition to the absorption of Honkai Energy, something that every Valkyrie can do, which is also capable of strengthening the user. More Honkai Energy also strengthens powers, Sirin previously could not send things to her dimension due to lack of energy, but after gaining more by absorbing the reactor and extra cores, she was able to not only send, but also create her dimension once again. Likewise, the Gem of Serenity, powered by additional Honkai Energy, was able to bypass the enhanced resistances of the Dr. Magi, and also allowed Seele to increase the level of her matter manipulation)\n* Energy Manipulation (Honkai Energy empowers weapons, which if sufficiently contaminated, begin to radiate pure Honkai Energy, mechas, battlesuits, and abilities. Basic manipulation allows users to concentrate, restrict their energy to the smallest possible space, release powerful beams of Honkai Energy, or transfer their energy, allowing one to utilize the donor's energy and experience the power flowing and resonating within them, empowering Kiana's Gugnir enough to severely injure a clone of Joyce, even though Gugnir could not do so before without the boost)\n* Life Manipulation (Honkai Energy can be used as food and was able to animate Fu Hua's sentience, which at the time was the feathers of Fenghuang Down, acting as a nucleus. Fu Hua could also absorb Hua's Honkai Energy to keep from fading away or dying, and releases of Honkai Energy are able to make plants grow)\n* Limited Power Nullification (Honkai Energy can disable minor things like radars and satellite guidance, rendering them useless, and sensors passively. As well as actively, as applying Honkai Energy to seals caused them to be undone, seals that effectively expelled anyone who attempted to make contact with it)\nHigh-Level Manipulation\nThose with near-perfect or perfect resistance to Honkai Energy, such as Blade Mantra masters, Flame-Chasers, high-level Valkyries, true Stigma Awakeners, natural Stigma wielders, successful subjects of Experiment X-10, as well as Herrschers and Pseudo-Herrschers are able to manipulate Honkai Energy to a much greater extent, granting them the following abilities:\nAbilities and Resistances\n* Reality Warping, Spacetime Manipulation, Physics Manipulation, Law Manipulation, and BFR (High concentrations of Honkai Energy cause curvatures in spacetime, and with enough energy it is possible to warp spacetime itself and warp targets to the Sea of Quanta. This spacetime distortion effect caused by Honkai Energy is known as the \"Reality Warping Field\", as it influences and mutates all the physical rules of spacetime, causing all sorts of supernatural phenomena, such as parallel worlds and time reversals)\n* Existence Erasure (Due to its users being able to BFR things to the Sea of Quanta, they have this ability by proxy, as the Sea of Quanta erases the existence of anything within it to the very information that composes it)\n* Matter Manipulation (Subatomic), Transmutation, Quantum Manipulation (High-level manipulation of Honkai Energy allows the user to manipulate matter on a subatomic level, allowing them to change and manipulate the form of matter, and also cause quantization to instantly collapse one's physical integrity, effectively dematerializing the target, causing them to disappear into the unknown, losing and destabilizing their physical existence into a quantum form that exists as a pure consciousness, being neither alive nor dead)\n* Self-Sustenance (All Types); Space Survival and Spaceflight (Herrschers do not need to eat, drink, rest and can breathe, live and fly in outer space without any problems)\n* Fate Manipulation (Only in the Sea of Quanta; Can decide the outcome of the future, which can guarantee a fortunate outcome. Destinies all timelines to align with one's will, can manifest a future based on one's desire to rewrite destiny)\n* Higher Dimensional Manipulation (Honkai energy can create anchors, which are special types of higher dimensional structures. La Niña, through Honkai energy, was able to affect the Aether Anchor, the source of all dimensions in the Sea of Quanta, and would have destroyed it) \n* Electromagnetic Manipulation (Honkai Energy can create electromagnetic field to penetrate armor and pulses to cause abnormalities, leaving the bodies of its victims unstable and susceptible to fainting)\n* Law Manipulation, Conceptual Manipulation (Type 1) and Pocket Reality Manipulation (High Honkai Energy manipulation can intervene in quantum quantity and draw power from the Quantum Sea, which grants the ability to harm abstract entities such as Quantum Shadow or even control them at one's command (Tialoc was created by Kevin). Additionally, the Quantum Sea's function is a projection of information and form that stabilizes the existence of bubble universes (imaginary possibilities) of a higher-dimensional phenomenon that operates on a different set of laws, and is stated to possess an infinite amount of concepts. Furthermore, all said byproducts are spawns of desires, thoughts, memories or emotions from cognition about reality. The user may be able to create their own separate dimension like bubble universes with an infinite space and limitless landscape via cognitive thought and can define their own natural laws that can ignore some types of basic reasons and laws based on their will (Dreams here are referred to an idea space/a bubble universe, as they were materialized from the artist's cognition and are not just mere dreams))\nHerrschers\nIn addition to possessing all of the above abilities and resistances, in Honkai Impact 3rd, there are 14 individual Herrschers and 12 Divine Keys, not counting transformations and variants. While each possesses their own unique powers, they all possess a set of abilities and resistances inherent to simply being a Herrscher or having access to a Herrscher Authority through a Divine Key, which are listed below: \nHerrscher Physiology\nHerrschers are humans corrupted by Honkai, their bodies are filled with Honkai energy, and they are the ultimate manifestation of Honkai adaptability. Due to the physiological differences between Herrschers and Divine Key users, this is only applicable to those who were born or corrupted into Herrschers at some point in their lives. Abilities and Resistances\n* Immortality (Types 1, 2, 6, 7, and 8; Herrschers can live for a thousand years, and due to being the final manifestations of the Honkai, they should be superior to both the Honkai beasts and the genes, which possess immortal bodies that do not grow beyond a specific age. Herrschers can survive having their limbs severed without lasting damage, and are able to remain conscious after having their torso separated from their legs. Herrschers can transfer their consciousness into their Herrscher cores to remain alive without a host/body, and are able to possess those who touch the core. Herrschers can only be killed when their Herrscher core is destroyed or removed)\n* Abstract Existence (Type 1) and Conceptual Manipulation (Type 1; Herrschers are imaginary concepts, born through Imaginary energy as abstract concepts that hold authority over something. As an example, the Herrscher of Finality has authority over time and is not affected by it as a result)\n* Aura (Overwhelming; Even unconscious, Herrschers passively radiate enough Honkai energy that the effects listed under \"Standard Effects\" occur extremely quickly, unless said Honkai energy is controlled. For example, humans would quickly turn into zombies just by being near the 3rd Herrscher when it first awakened. Additionally, 1000HW is enough for Honkai energy to kill on contact; Herrschers are born with at least 1000HW and are sometimes capable of reaching over 4000HW)\n* Blessed and Supernatural Luck (Herrschers are protected by the Will of the Honkai, granting them the ability to turn the tide even in desperate situations due to a massive increase in their luck. Herrschers and Divine Keys are also directly channeled with the Imaginary Tree as the source of their powers, and they themselves are a mimic of GOD's power)\n* Manipulation Higher Dimensional, Time Manipulation, and Causality Manipulation (The Herrschers' ability to control higher dimensional space can be used to manipulate time—past, present, and future—which is a primordial abstract concept that acts as sequence and causality, which also has its own concepts and laws outside of the universe)\n* Self-Sustenance (All Types), Space Survival, and Spaceflight (Herrschers do not need to eat, drink, or rest, and can breathe, live, and fly in outer space without issue)\n* Enhanced Spatial Manipulation (Herrschers are linked to the Imaginary Tree, which has allowed them to tear apart space and the very fabric of reality through normal attacks)\n* Dimensional Travel (Through their cores, Herrschers can enter and exit higher dimensional realms such as the Sea of Quanta, though the latter is only accessible through portals.)\n* Limited Fusionism and Power Absorption (Herrschers can merge as one, and can consume the each other's cores to gain their powers)\n* Invulnerability (Due to their powers that defy the laws of physics, Herrschers and high-level Honkai beasts are beings of transcendental logic that cannot be harmed by regular weaponry.)\n* Animal Manipulation (Herrschers can control Honkai beasts)\nHerrscher Authority\nHerrschers and Divine Keys have access to extra powers stemming from Herrscher authorities derived from imaginary concepts, granting them powers akin to large-scale reality distortion. Abilities and Resistances\n* Reality Warping, Dimensional Manipulation, Mathematical Manipulation, Portal Creation, Summoning, Spatial Manipulation, Sealing and Matter Manipulation (Quantum; Imaginary Singularities are a fundamental attribute of Herrscher cores, being this a mathematically impossible structure that can trigger all supernatural phenomena, existing in all dimensions simultaneously. These singularities are pending signs of dimensional bleeding, which continually leak Honkai Energy even in dormancy, corrupting the world into a multidimensional anomaly in its space-time, assimilating it into an Imaginary Space, a space built on imaginary numbers. Herrschers and their singularities are linked to the Imaginary Tree, and can summon Imaginary constructs. Herrschers can also create spatial singularities that can trap people in quantum wells, even those with the Genius, a device that allows travel through space-time, the Sea of Quanta, and even Imaginary Space)\n* Law Manipulation, Conceptual Manipulation (Type 1) and Subjective Reality (The Herrschers' Honkai Energy comes from the realm of Imaginary Space, a place without common sense, capable of defying the laws of reality and physical constants, causing phenomena impossible in reality to be common in this realm, being directly linked to Honkai eruptions, as these eruptions are caused by Honkai Energy leaking from Imaginary Space into reality, events described as paranormal phenomena. It is also noted that the very nature of Honkai in Imaginary Space causes the laws of Real Space to fail. Herrschers not only create eruptions with their births, but are automatically linked to Imaginary Space through their cores, allowing them to access, control and extract their Honkai Energy. It is also where their powers to defy the laws of physics come from, allowing them to break, bend, twist and change the laws of physics, logic and reality altogether, as the laws of the universe serve them, imposing (these non-existent phenomena and their authority over the world through their thoughts becoming reality)\nPower, Range, and Resistance\nHonkai Energy is a phenomenon with its origin being the Imaginary Space, with the latter existing beyond the Sea of Quanta, being infinite even in a transfinite sense as absolute infinity. Furthermore, Honkai energy also supports the Sea of Quanta and the Aether Anchor, with the latter being 11-dimensional, with higher dimensions and its inhabitants being able to easily destroy lower-dimensional realms as if they were a book and are completely unaffected by everything that comes from them, with Honkai also having a connection to it. La Niña was also able to corrode and destroy the Aether Anchor using her Honkai energy.\nHigh-level users of Honkai Energy draw it directly from the Sea of Quanta, and they have enough Honkai resistance to withstand the Sea; furthermore, this resistance is what allows the manipulation of Honkai energy, with such mastery allowing its user to send people into the Sea of Quanta. For more information on the tiers of Honkai Energy and who obtains it, check out this blog. For a better and more detailed explanation of the cosmology, check out this one.\nHonkai Energy qualifies for Hyperverse-level (1-B) potency and resistances due to its nature and feats listed above; and High Complex Multiverse-level (High 1-C) reach, as its users can send things into the Sea of Quanta, and users can also draw and resist Honkai energy from the same realms as supporting evidence.

          "content": "A Herrscher — also known as a Lawman, Lawmaker, or Ruler — is an envoy, or rather apostle of the Honkai, who inhabit human vessels that are capable of adapting to it, manifesting out of the host's negative emotions. They are powered via a Herrscher Core, which is essential to their entire existence. In the Current Era, Herrscher Cores are in an alive state, so if the Core is not neutralized when the body is destroyed, the Herrscher can take over another person as a vessel, provided that vessel has the Core implanted.\n\nHerrschers, as their title suggests, have become more than human, effortlessly transcending human capabilities. They are capable of bending worldly laws to their whim and command entire armies of zombies and Honkai Beasts, to overwhelm and destroy human civilization, the goal of the Honkai.\n\nOne Herrscher alone is quite powerful, but against humanity's technology, it often takes more than one of them to actually destroy the world. Additionally, as humanity adapts, the Honkai adapts, and the Herrschers adapt too. Two Herrschers of the Previous Era were able to bring destruction to civilization with abilities engineered specifically to counter them, while lacking the ability to contend with the destructive capability of other Herrschers.\n\nIn Chapter 34, Tesla states that the Herrschers that descend upon humanity are not 'true' Herrschers. Instead, their Herrscher Cores are projections of the Cocoon of Finality's powers through different dimensions, thus making them appear in reality. The Cocoon of Finality is the only imaginary singularity and the one and only 'true' Herrscher core. Thus the Cocoon of Finality is the only 'true' Herrscher, while the other Herrschers are shadows, or fractions, of Finality.\n\nFortunately, not all Herrschers are against humanity, as in rare cases they can conquer the will of the Herrscher inside them that is making them succumb to their hatred against other humans, or can become allies instead. This \"will\" can also align with its host, like the case with Raiden Mei and the \"voice\" inside her head.\n\nThe Herrscher of Sentience formed in Fu Hua but instead of becoming instantly destructive like a regular Herrscher, Fu Hua's memories of more than 50,000 years diluted the Herrscher personality, making it want to fight the Honkai and resenting it for destroying everything she loves. The Herrscher of Sentience initially even assumes that it was the new and improved Fu Hua until it realised its error and went off the grid after returning Fu Hua's body.\n\nKiana is also mostly able to suppress Sirin and even retains her personality while fighting off Honkai and even saving people as she did in Arc City. A few people even admire her for her bravery as shown in the CG of Chapter 23.\n\nHerrschers\nIn addition to possessing all of the above abilities and resistances, in Honkai Impact 3rd, there are 14 individual Herrschers and 12 Divine Keys, not counting transformations and variants.

            "Schicksal"
          ],
          "content": "Schicksal is one of the two main organizations that lead the fight against the Honkai. It was established in the fifth century and has been active ever since. Unlike its rival organization based in North America, Schicksal's influence is far greater and extends over its homeland.\n\nThe organization is currently led by Otto Apocalypse and was first established in Europe. In modern day, their power extends throughout all of Eurasia, with the HQ being somewhere above the Mediterranean Sea.\n\nHistory: In 1470, Schicksal stood as the largest anti-Honkai entity in the world. Schicksal was able to spread itself far by offering “protection” from the Honkai to various European countries, such as Italy, which eventually lead to their capital being stationed in Vienna. Nikolas Apocalypse became consumed by greed in his old age. Under his command, Schicksal started aiming its sight towards conquering more and more land. This goal brought them to conflict with the armies of Ming in Shenzhou, China.\n\nManga Story: Elan Palatinus\nIn 1475, the forces of Schicksal and Ming fought each other on Kipchak Steppe. Initially evenly matched, Schicksal soon brought out weapons powered by Honkai to turn the tide. However, using these weapons lead soldiers to lethal Honkai infection. The Ming army was just about to be defeated, until they brought out their secret weapon—a being known as the \"Immortal Celestial”.\n\nThis being had many legends surrounding her, but the Schicksal armies were unfazed and tried to kill her. They failed, as The Celestial used Fenghuang Down. Schicksal decided to bring out their own Legend—Kallen Kaslana, who wielded a Divine Key known as the Oath of Judah. However, Kallen failed as well. The battle ended with Schicksal’s total defeat and the crusaders went back to Europe afterwards. This battle became known as the Battle of Shenzhou.\n\nTo pay for their losses, Schicksal began selling required “indulgences”, which “absolved the buyer of their mortal sins”. They also raised taxes by an incredible amount. Due to this, the people of Western Europe began to hate Schicksal. Their corruption was made obvious when a priest tried to kidnap a woman’s child. He was stopped by Otto Apocalypse and Kallen. Shortly after, the two pass by a performer known as Shakespeare, who was openly denouncing Schicksal. The guards attempt to arrest Shakespeare for slander, but a disguised Kallen swoops in to save her.\n\nThroughout this manga, it is shown that Schicksal had kidnapped many young girls, experimenting on them to try and open a mysterious black box. It apparently held a cure for the again rising plague. When the Overseer opens the black box, Kallen invades, and takes it with her. Thus, their star Valkyrie was no longer on their side.\n\nThe Schicksal Civil War: Risa Apocalypse was the leading force in the events that led up to the war. She wanted power, and she was willing to do anything to reach that goal: even if it meant manipulating her nephew or killing her father. In 1477, she decided it was time for Nikolas's death. It is unclear whether she poisoned him herself or made someone else do it, however. Using Kallen's upcoming execution as leverage, she manipulated her youngest brother Otto into helping her in exchange for him and Kallen escaping. Despite their plans, Kallen died to one of the Honkai Beasts released as a diversion at the time of her execution. Otto left the country by boat, wracked with guilt.\n\nWith no one left to oppose Risa, Marseille Apocalypse took up the position as Overseer. This was according to Nikolas's will, but his daughter didn't plan on doing what he wanted. Schicksal grew all the crueler, with killings left and right, and the capture of citizens who \"crossed the line\". These citizens were then put into jail to be experimented on, which very few survived. This only increased with the rebellion years later.\n\nAfter 14 years of terror under the reign of Marseille, Otto came back. He and some of his followers organized a rebel army in 1491 to overthrow him. This army consisted of normal townsfolk, the Schicksal Eradication Society (a rebel group), and students of St. Michael's Abbey: an orphanage that Otto had built in the 14 years away. These students had Stigmata, and thus would be the final gambit in the battle. Normal citizens looked to Kallen Kaslana as The Holy Maid and wished to fight for her image. Together, everyone defeated Risa and Marseille. Otto was given the position of Overseer.\n\nEveryone rejoiced, not knowing that their savior would morph into humanity's worst nightmare.\n\nAnti-Entropy: In 1952, the first Herrscher, Welt Joyce, was born. His awakening destroyed the epicenter of Berlin and killed 300,000 people.\n\nThe odd thing about him was that he woke up an amnesiac. Schicksal captured him for study, but couldn't get many answers from him. For three years he was subjected to being only a test subject -- not even given a name. He was transferred to the Schicksal 42nd Lab in London, where he met Einstein and Tesla. Einstein gave him a name on the spot: Welt Joyce.\n\nThem and a researcher nicknamed Finn decided to travel to the North American branch per Schrodinger's request. A Previous Era site had been discovered. The most powerful Schicksal Valkyrie at the time, Reanna Brigantia, was sent to accompany them. Tensions were already high between the North American branch and Otto at this point, but their discovery would make the pot boil over. Through translating ancient texts and searching the Previous Era site, they found the Star of Eden and information on technology known as \"the Moonlight Throne\".\n\nEdison, Schrodinger, and Finns were on the cusp of recreating it, but something went awry. It turned out that Otto was aware that what they were going to make would be a threat to his authority, and wanted to interfere with their experiment. He blackmailed Finns with his son Joachim's safety in exchange for sabotaging the project. This succeeded, and Edison died trying to get the massive amount of Honkai energy away from the city. Half of Schrodinger's body turned to Honkai carapace as well. Otto forcefully took control over Reanna and stabbed Finns when he tried to tell everyone the truth.\n\nWith Void Archives, Otto managed to wound almost everyone, including Welt, Einstein, and Tesla. Otto had actually tried to kill off Joachim first, but Welt took the blow for him. Schrodinger used Abyss Flower's Zeroth power to heal the three, causing her to de-stabilize, and Reanna took control over her body again. Otto decided it was best to eradicate all of them at once -- and ordered fission missiles to be fired to their location (New York). Welt, heavily wounded, stopped the bombs with Reanna. The two of them perished in this effort.\n\nIn the aftermath, the North American branch officially cut ties with Schicksal and became what is now known as Anti-Entropy. Otto marked them as a terrorist organization, and the two have been at war since.\n\nThe Three Houses: Within the organization exists the Three Noble Houses or Branch Families. They bear the highest prestige and respect from its members, and those belonging to these three families are often the strongest and most powerful combatants against the Honkai.\n\nHouse Schariac: The Schariac have excellent control over Honkai energies, and its fighters mainly consisted of women. Their role in Schicksal is the \"Divine Maiden\".\n\nHouse Kaslana: The Kaslana were born with excellent resistance against the Honkai, a parallel of the Schariac. Its fighters mainly consisted of men, and its patriarchs are often considered the most powerful members of the lineage. Their role in Schicksal is the \"Knight\".\n\nHouse Apocalypse: The Apocalypse that govern Schicksal completely lack strength and power to fight against the Honkai, unlike the Schariac or the Kaslana., and instead only govern the organization and facilitate its activities with their intelligence. Their role in Schicksal is the \"Overseer\".\n\nValkyries: Valkyries and Knights are powerful warriors and the main combat power of Schicksal against the Honkai.\n\nAnti-Honkai Special Force: The Anti-Honkai Special Force are special Schicksal squads.\n\nTrivia:\nSchicksal means fate in German.\nSchicksal as an organization may be based of the Catholic Church,\nSchicksal has many church motifs.\nIt is a global organization\nIt held religious authority\n\n"

The trauma of killing displaced him morally .\n\t•\tThe Entity’s Manipulation: The Entity used Philip’s spiritual guilt and tribal belief, offering a way to atone by delivering more sacrifices.

He was fed through a wall-hole and never acknowledged or named by his parents.  ￼\n\t•\tTurning Point: Upon escaping confinement, he brutally murdered his parents in vengeance, then tormented livestock and killed authority figures, including deputies and a corrupt sheriff, as offering for their cruel treatment.

His most iconic feature is a blank, pale white mask with black hair visible atop. The mask has a smooth, emotionless surface with hollow, endless black eye sockets. His hair is short, dark, and unkempt—sometimes varying in shade depending on cosmetic skins—but the default DLC model shows a single patch of slightly wavy blond hair peeking from the mask as an add-on collectible  ￼.\n\t•\tAge & Ethnicity: Canonically American; adult Michael appears in his mid-30s (born in 1957 in lore), though Dead by Daylight doesn’t specify exact age.

This bond is used to fuel his perks like “Dying Light” or “Play With Your Food,” turning it into a perverse hunt dynamic  ￼ ￼.\n\nAbilities & Gameplay Mechanics\nHis power, Evil Within, progresses through three tiers based on stalking survivors:\n\t1.\tTier I: Reduced speed and lunge, no terror radius, invisible to survivors—focus on stalking.\n\t2.\tTier II: Normal movement, reduced terror radius, stealth still maintained.\n\t3.\tTier III: Gain a powerful instant-down lunge and noticeably more aggressive; duration extends with add-ons. After this, he then reverts to Tier II due to power drain  ￼ ￼.\n\nImportant add-ons (all tied to Evil Within):\n\t•\tBlond Hair: +10 s to Tier III, & ups threshold to enter it  ￼.\n\t•\tMemorial Flower / J. Myers Memorial: Buff stalk speed significantly  ￼.\n\t•\tGlass Fragment / Mirror Shard: Reveal survivors’ auras after stalking  ￼.\n\t•\tTombstone Piece / Judith’s Tombstone: Grants killing power at Tier III but drastically raises thresholds  ￼.\n\t•\tReflective Fragment: Grants minor aura-reading in Tier II  ￼.\n\nWeapons & Audio\n\t•\tWeapon: Standard kitchen knife, used for lethal basic attacks and powerful lunges.\n\t•\tSound FX: Iconic heavy breathing and creeping footsteps define his terror presence  ￼.\n\nLore Background & Ethnicity\nOriginally from Haddonfield, Illinois, Michael killed his sister Judith at age six and returned 15 years later to continue his killing spree  ￼. He embodies an inexplicable evil—described as possessed, cursed by a soul named Edna in fan lore, compelled to replay his ritual of slaughter  ￼. Licensed into Dead by Daylight via the HALLOWEEN® Chapter, he stands as one of the purest licensed horror killers, revered for staying authentic to franchise history  ￼.\n\nPersonality & Favorite Things\n\t•\tFavorite “Things”: The hunt itself. Silence, stalking, and fear. He draws power from terror.\n\t•\tPersonality Traits: Emotionless assassin—silent, patient, chillingly methodical, utterly devoid of empathy.\n\nModel Design & Visual Details\nThe in-game model closely mirrors the original film look: tall, slender physique, 6’2″–6’3″ build, rigid posture, slight head tilt, shoutless yet breathing-laden presence . There exists community demand for rework to align graphics with newer Killer quality, but the existing design remains faithful and functional in gameplay"

You're no god. You're just a person. You don't need to serve anyone. You can be the one to choose.\nEREN YEAGER URGES YMIR TO BE FREE\n\nYmir Fritz (ユミル・フリッツ Yumiru Furittsu?) was the first person to obtain the power of the Titans.[5][6] She was a slave of the Eldian king, who abused her power to bring prosperity to Eldia while devastating Marley and the rest of the world. Thirteen years after awakening her power, she died protecting the king; her corpse was then forcibly cannibalized by their daughters, Maria, Rose, and Sheena. Her powers then split into what eventually became known as the Nine Titans.[5][7][8]\n\nUpon her death, Ymir was transported to the Coordinate, where she molded Titans out of the sands and obeyed the royal family whenever they sought the Founder's power.[9]\n\nAppearance\n\nHuman\n\nYmir Fritz was small in stature with light hair. She had straight cut bangs with shoulder-length hair that later grew down to her shoulder blades with age. As a slave, she wore tattered clothing with a cloth headband, sash belt, and leather sandals laced above her ankles. After entering the favor of the Eldian King in adolescence and adulthood, Ymir wore a sleeveless dress with thin decorative bands around each arm. Like all slaves of the Eldian tribe, her tongue was cut out when she was captured, though it may have regenerated after acquiring the power of the Titans.\n\nIn posthumous illustrations depicting Ymir Fritz, she is shown as a young girl wearing white robes. In the book Frieda Reiss reads to Historia Reiss, Ymir is dark-haired, whereas in the book Yeager reads to Grisha Yeager, she is fair-haired.\n\nTitan\n\nYmir Fritz's Titan form was enormous in size with light hair, a typically female figure, and long, protruding ribs. Her Titan's face possessed no apparent skin, musculature or eyes, leaving only a visible skull.\n\nIn posthumous illustrations, Ymir's Titan form is highly romanticized with more human features.\n\nPersonality\n\nBeing a subject of ancient history, there are various interpretations of who Ymir really was. Frieda Reiss described Ymir as a kind girl who was always thinking of others.[2][10] Eldians speak of Ymir with great reverence, praising her accomplishments for their people. On the other hand, the Marleyan propaganda maintains that Ymir was a pawn of the Devil, with whom she had made a deal, causing her and all her subjects to be despised by much of the world.\n\nIn reality, she was a slave with no will of her own.[11] She submitted to the Eldian king in life, building him his empire, brutally destroying his enemies, and bearing his children as he commanded.[12] Ymir even went so far as to sacrifice her own life for his.[13] Even in death, her soul remained blindly obedient to the Eldian royal family, creating Titans by hand for about 2,000 years in the unknown land surrounding the Coordinate.[11]\n\nDespite not being able to fully understand her, Eren states that Ymir loved Fritz despite his poor treatment of her and his responsibility for destroying her hometown which led to the death of her parents. She was also willing to carry out his will for generations while waiting for someone to release her from the agony of love and yearned for that freedom.[14]\nHistory\n\nEldia enslaving Ymir's village\nYmir was enslaved by the Eldians\nAround 2,000 years ago, Ymir's village was attacked and enslaved by the Eldians, who also murdered her parents and cut out the tongues of the survivors.[15][3]\n\nOne night, Ymir opened the gate to a pen, allowing for some pigs to escape.[16] Later, the tribe's ruler, Fritz, questioned the slaves on the culprit. The slaves pointed to Ymir, who was released only to be hunted down for sport.[17]\n\nWounded and desperate, Ymir found an unusually large tree with a chasm at its base. Seeking shelter, she stepped inside and, not knowing of the sinkhole beneath, fell down into a pool of liquid. There, a mysterious spine-like creature fused with her and turned her into the first Titan.[18]\n\nWith her newfound power, Ymir returned to serve Fritz and used her Titan to cultivate the land, build bridges, and amass wealth for the Eldians. Under his command, she also vanquished the armies of Eldia's rival, Marley. To \"reward\" Ymir for her service, Fritz took her as his concubine and together, they had three children: Maria, Rose, and Sheena.[19] It was speculated that during this time, Ymir grew to genuinely love and care for Fritz despite his behavior and attitude towards her.[3]\n\nMaria, Rose, and Sheena cannibalize Ymir\nYmir's corpse was forcibly cannibalized by her daughters\nThirteen years after acquiring the power of the Titans, Ymir died while thwarting an assassination attempt on Fritz, but then found herself in a mysterious, barren land. King Fritz then forced his daughters to eat their mother's corpse in an attempt to preserve the power of the Titans. He commanded his daughters to continuously reproduce, to have their children eat their spines upon their deaths and perpetuate this ritual from child to child so that Ymir's blood would not die out and Eldia could rule forever with its Titans.\n\nYmir's power was divided into the Nine Titans; and she continued to serve her descendants, building them Titans whenever they invoked the power of the Titans.[9][20]\nMythology\n\nYmir Fritz makes a deal with the Devil\nMarleyan interpretation of Ymir\nBy the Eldians, Ymir's existence is hailed as a god-given miracle.[21] The Restorationists claimed that she and all Subjects of Ymir are \"the chosen children of God\"[22] and that any atrocities Marley claims Eldia had committed could not have been possible because Ymir would not have allowed it.[23] There was even an Eldian cult that worshiped Ymir as a goddess.[24]\n\nOn the other hand, the Marleyans believe she received her powers from a deal with the \"Devil of All Earth\"[5] and used this to ostracize the Eldians.\n\nThere are also those who believe that Ymir contacted the \"source of all living matter\" to gain her power. This theory is relatively unheard of, as Grisha Yeager was unaware of it until Eren Kruger told him.[6]\n\nYmir Fritz's story\n\"Krista\" in Frieda's storybook\nMany centuries later, Frieda Reiss would visit her half-sister Historia Reiss on the farm where she was raised. During some of her visits, Frieda told Historia the story of Ymir's deal with the Devil; however, in the book she showed her, Ymir is named \"Krista\".[1] Frieda advised Historia that she must be lady-like, as \"Krista\" was. She spoke of \"Krista\" as being an altruistic girl and urged Historia to be loving and beloved like her when she is grown. However, Historia did not remember these visits since Frieda used the Founding Titan's power to erase her memories after every visit. Historia would only recall vague images of \"Krista\" in the years to come.[25][26]\n\nLegacy\n\nReturn to Shiganshina arc\n\nNine Titans\nYmir Fritz stands above the Nine Titans\nSome years later, when the Survey Corps discovers Grisha Yeager's basement, they find three journals.[27] Within Grisha's writings, he recounts his childhood when he was told the story of Ymir and her people by his father.[28] Grisha writes of joining the Eldian Restorationists in the nation of Marley several years afterward, learning of the supposed great accomplishments achieved in Ymir's time. Together with the resistance, Grisha declares that they must venture to Paradis Island, where Ymir's descendants had fled eighty years ago, in order to retrieve the Founding Titan and bring back the nation of Eldia.[29]\n\nWar for Paradis arc\n\nWhile on the verge of death from Levi's Thunder Spear, Zeke Yeager would awaken in an unknown land to discover Ymir resculpting his damaged body with earth.[30]\n\nDuring the assault on Shiganshina, Zeke and his younger half-brother Eren Yeager are able to make contact with each other and activate the Founder before awakening in the Paths. As Ymir approaches, Eren notices her presence. Zeke explains that she is in fact the Founder herself. He then asks Eren to go ahead with the Euthanasia Plan. Eren refuses and demands that Ymir lend him her strength, but his pleas are ignored. Zeke subsequently reveals he has nullified the vow to renounce war through Ymir, who obeys only the royal family, her descendants. She promptly restrains Eren with her chains.[31]\n\nAfter Zeke shows Eren the memories of their father Grisha, Zeke realizes that Eren was responsible for Grisha's actions against the Reiss family and that his ultimate goal is inevitable. In a panic, Zeke orders Ymir to sterilize the Subjects of Ymir; and Ymir approaches the Coordinate of converging paths to fulfill Zeke's will.[32]\n\nYmir is freed\nYmir chooses to help Eren\nEren manages to break free from his chains and reach Ymir before Zeke. Realizing that Ymir has a will of her own, Eren embraces her and asks her to help him rather than try to order her. As Zeke desperately tries to stop them, Eren asks Ymir if she was the one who called him to the Coordinate, musing that she has been waiting 2000 years for him to arrive. Ymir begins crying.\n\nBack in Shiganshina, Eren's head is reconnected to his body. As everyone looks on in shock, the Wall crumbles, releasing a horde of Colossus Titans as Eren forms a new Titan body.[33]\n\nA while later, as Eren leads the Titans in the Rumbling, an apparition of Ymir is seen by a boy in the moment he is crushed to death under a Titan's foot.[34]\n\nAs Eren converses with his friends in the Paths, Ymir emerges next to Eren in the Coordinate, symbolizing their cooperation.[35]\n\nAs the Warrior unit along with members of Survey Corps engage numerous Titans on top the Founding Titan in an attempt to reach Eren at Fort Salta, Ymir appears and is briefly seen by Armin Arlert who speculates she is the one summoning the previous incarnations of the Nine Titans.[36]\n\nMikasa kisses Eren goodbye\nYmir is freed following Mikasa's choice to kill the one she loves\nAfter Mikasa Ackerman kills Eren, Ymir appears behind her, smiling as she watches Mikasa kiss Eren farewell.[37]\n\nImmediately afterwards, Ymir relinquishes the Power of the Titans from the world. Watching Mikasa kill the one she loves was enough to release Ymir from the love she had for Fritz, who only wanted to exploit her power.[38]\n\nAs Mikasa departs from the battlefield, Ymir appears to her. Mikasa understands that Ymir's love for Fritz was a nightmare that she cannot undo; she instead thanks Ymir for bringing the life into the world which allowed for her to be born. Ymir then envisions a different outcome where she lets King Fritz get impaled by the spear, consoling her three daughters, and subsequently vanishes at last.[39]\n\nAbilities\n\nPower of the Titans\n\nThe first Titan\nYmir's gigantic Titan\nYmir was the very first Titan and the only one to ever possess the complete power of the Titans; all who came after her merely possessed fragments of her power. Her Titan body was immense, even by Titan standards, and easily towered above the treeline. Using her immense strength, she effortlessly wiped out Marley's forces. She was also very skilled at controlling her Titan, as she performed complex tasks such as building bridges across mountains and cultivating the fields.[40]\n\nIt is said that nobody could surpass Ymir, and that because Ymir died 13 years after awakening her powers, no one was allowed to live beyond that; this phenomenon was known as the \"Curse of Ymir.\"[7]\n\nYmir sculps the Wall Titans\nYmir building the Wall Titans for Karl Fritz\nAfter Ymir's death, her spirit lived on in a world where the Coordinate resides.[41] She was responsible for all Titan transformations throughout history: whenever the power of the Titans was invoked, she built the Titan bodies out of the otherworldly sand.[9] She was also responsible for regeneration and re-sculpted Zeke's body after he was blown up.[42] It reportedly took Ymir a very long time to create these bodies: Zeke said it took her \"years\" to build him a single human body, but because the world in which she lived transcends time, the process was almost an instant in the physical world.[42] According to Zeke, Ymir could create anything, even chains that represent the \"vow of renouncing war.\"[43]\n\nYmir was also the source of the Founding Titan's power. From controlling other Titans to creating the Wall Titans to altering the bodies of the Subjects of Ymir, all of the Founding Titan's feats were done by Ymir after she was given the order, either by a scream or in person through the world where Ymir resided.[44] However, because Ymir was Fritz's slave, she only listened to the commands of the royal family; thus, only the royal family could use the Founder's power.[11]\n\nEren Yeager became the exception to this, as he invoked the Founder on two occasions. The first was when he punched Dina Fritz's Pure Titan and commanded Ymir to make the surrounding Titans attack Dina; after she was killed, he turned them against Reiner Braun.[45] The second was when Eren convinced Ymir that she had a will of her own, freeing her from the royal family's control, and she lent her power to Eren instead of Zeke"

He was the main protagonist of Attack on Titan. He lived in Shiganshina District with his parents until the fall of Wall Maria, where he impotently witnessed his mother being eaten by a Titan.[33] This event would lead to Eren's intense hatred towards the Titans as he swore to wipe all of them off the face of the Earth.[34]\n\nSoon afterward, his father, Grisha Yeager, found him and gave him the key to his basement, instructing Eren to find it at all costs and retake Wall Maria.[35] He then injected Eren with a Titan serum.[35]\n\nIn the year 847, Eren, Mikasa Ackerman, and Armin Arlert joined the 104th Training Corps. The three graduated with Eren ranking 5th best,[36] and they joined the Survey Corps following the battle of Trost District.[37]\n\nAfter finding the basement and unlocking his father's memories, Eren learned about the truth of what the Titans are, as well as the history of Eldia and Marley. Eren then vowed to free his home from their true enemy: the rest of humanity that lives across the ocean.[38]\n\nEren possessed the power of three Titans. From his father, Eren inherited the Attack and Founding Titans.[39] After eating Lara Tybur during the Raid on Liberio, he gained the War Hammer Titan as well.[8]\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n00:00\n\n41:20\n\nHuman form\n\nEren's appearance in manga\nEren shortly before graduating the 104th Training Corps\nEren was a young man of average height and muscular build. His facial features strongly resembled his mother's; he had a reasonably long, rounded face and sizable, expressive, gray eyes. His hair was short and black, and his bangs fell in a natural, middle-parted, curtain-type style. After his training and during his time as a soldier, he became very physically fit and muscular, although this was often unseen due to his relatively baggy clothing.[40] After the four-year time skip, Eren grew his hair down to his neck.\n\nEren was first seen wearing typical townsfolk attire that consisted of brown trousers, a green shirt with string tassels at the collar, a reddish-brown coat, and simple brown shoes. A few years before the fall of Wall Maria, he also wore a black scarf, which he gave to Mikasa Ackerman the day they met. As a teenager, he was often seen in the typical Survey Corps uniform while training. His casual attire consisted of a long beige shirt identical to the one he wore in his first appearance, a maroon sash around his waist, white trousers, and brown knee-high boots. He always kept the key given to him by his father dangling around his neck on a string.[41]\n\nBy the time Eren infiltrates Marley in the year 854, Eren had grown visibly taller, and his hair has grown down to shoulder length. He had a slight mustache and goatee, as well as bandages that cover his forehead and left eye. To maintain his cover, he wore the Eldian armband around his left arm, though he had initially worn the armband around his right arm before it got corrected by Falco Grice.[42] After returning to Paradis Island, Eren discarded his Survey Corps attire and began wearing a white shirt with dark pants underneath a simple black mantle.[43] He tied his hair back into a bun and shaved off his mustache and goatee.[44]\n\nAttack Titan form\n\nArmin and Titan Eren\nEren as a Titan\nEren's appearance changes quite drastically when he transformed into the Attack Titan. His height increased to 15 m, his hair grew long enough to graze his shoulders, and his tongue and ears became elongated. His facial features also underwent a transformation; he developed a prominent, hooked nose, his eyes became deeply sunken within their sockets, and his mouth took on an unusual, jagged shape that was unsuited for intelligible speech. Despite this, he was capable of howling and roaring in order to express his exhaustion and anger. In addition, he also lacked lips and flesh on his cheeks, so his teeth were exposed.\n\nSimilarly to past Attack Titan holders, Eren's Titan form was well-proportioned and physically fit, sporting a well-defined, lean, and muscular appearance in lieu of the more common pot-bellied or emaciated appearances of regular Titans.[45]\n\nFounding Titan form\n\nEren's Founding Titan, dubbed the End Titan[9], was drastically different than Ymir Fritz's Founding Titan, or any other Titan for that matter. Initially, much of the Titan was shrouded by the steam from the Wall Titans, but its sheer size was immediately noted, towering over the horde of Wall Titans. What appeared to be the torso was devoid of flesh, resembling an enormous ribcage. The knobs of the backbone and ribs were grossly lengthened; the ribs reaching the ground while the arch of the spine extended far into the sky. The pelvis and legs were greatly undersized however, seemingly useless. Despite this, they were still taller than any Wall Titan. [46]\n\nThe upper body seemed proportional with the legs, meaning that they were dwarfed by the \"ribcage\" (although it was revealed that the \"ribcage\" arose from the lower back). The head was the only part of the body with much flesh, although it was significantly deformed: both the ears and hair were greatly elongated; the cheeks were missing, exposing the molars; and the bottom jaw was nearly bare, only the lips and chin being present. Like a puppet, the upper body was suspended by sinew, supported by the vertebral knobs like a suspension bridge. Inside the Titan, Eren's head was disconnected from his torso; having been decapitated and rejoined by Ymir's power, it was connected by additional vertebrae to what presumably was his body. Some sinew supports his scalp.\n\nThe Titan walked with its \"ribcage\", undulating the ribs like a millipede's legs. It was fast enough to keep within view of the Rumbling.[47]\n\nPure Titan form\n\nEren's Pure Titan form was much shorter than his current Titan form. It was 4 m[12] tall with short, rugged hair and a jagged, lipless mouth that exposed his teeth. His Pure Titan form also had a big head, elongated ears, and an overall stocky build.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nEren vows to kill all the Titans\nEren expresses his desire to kill the Titans\nEren was best described as hardheaded, strong-willed, passionate, and impulsive, which are attributes of both his strong determination to protect mankind and, eventually, his equally strong determination to escape the Walls. Even as a young child, he was so intent on joining the Survey Corps that he argued with and shouted at his mother, referring to the people in the village as \"silly\" and comparing them to complacent livestock.[48]\n\nEren cared deeply for his friends and family, risking harm and even death in order to protect them. As a child, he took on larger boys who bullied Armin Arlert and, more tragically, he attempted to lift the rubble that crushed his mother during the Titans' assault in Shiganshina.[49] Eren was also capable of displaying violent behavior in defense of people he did not even know. This was highlighted when he attempted to rescue Mikasa Ackerman by brutally slaughtering two of the human traffickers who had captured her.[50]\n\nAfter Armin showed Eren a book depicting the wonders of the outside world, he grew to share his friend's curiosity of the world beyond the Walls and decided to see it for himself.[51] This led Eren to develop a scornful attitude towards anyone who was content to live and die within the Walls' confines without ever setting foot outside. As a result of this, he greatly admired the soldiers of the Survey Corps, regarding them as \"heroes\" and wishing to join their ranks as soon as he became eligible for enrollment. He was quick to take offense when anyone spoke badly of the Corps, and his determination to join them caused friction between himself, his mother, and to a lesser extent, Mikasa.[52]\n\nEren has a marked lack of self-restraint that often led him into trouble, causing his friends and family to worry about him.[53] His limited self-control was evident in his temper, which often caused him to act recklessly in anger, or say things he himself knew he should not have. This was exacerbated by his tendency to view the world in terms of black and white, where individuals who deny others their freedom were worthless scum, unfit to be left alive.[54] Though he had great compassion, Eren had little in the way of empathy and was prone to taking things at face value, evaluating situations or ideas solely by his own arbitrary perspective and rarely ever thought deeper about them unless someone else pointed things out for him.[55]\n\nThough Eren spoke about eradicating the Titans with seemingly great confidence, his bravado hid deep insecurities. He was often ready to blame himself and his incompetence whenever something went wrong, believing a course of action he took - or failed to take - was the reason for the disastrous results. This was most evident when he blamed himself for the death of the Special Operations Squad at the hands of the Female Titan, and for the deaths of the many veterans that perished in the rescue operation after he had been kidnapped by Reiner Braun and Bertolt Hoover.\n\nEren asking Historia to eat him\nEren asks Historia to eat him and save humanity\nEren's ordeals since the coup d'état have mellowed his personality considerably. When he discovered the truth about where his father had been the night Wall Maria fell, he was willing to ask Historia Reiss to eat him for the good of humanity.[56] He admitted that he viewed himself as weak, and that his reliance on the Attack Titan proved it. It took a lot of encouragement from his friends for him to overcome this state of despair and regain his passion.\n\nBy the time he found out from his father's books that Titans were actually humans who were forced to transform by the Marleyan Government, he seemed to have let go of his hatred against them. When passing by a slow-moving Titan en route to the ocean, he showed no signs of anger or unrest, and instead calmly called the Titan an \"Eldian.\"[57]\n\nEren possesses great amounts of perseverance, fortitude, and determination. As such, he managed to master the basics of vertical maneuvering equipment, even when his equipment was damaged,[58] and graduate as fifth top trainee in his class despite his lack of natural talent.[59]\n\nEren had been noted to be quite charismatic and had a talent for delivering impassioned speeches, often unwittingly managing to persuade the mass of his listeners to sympathize with his point of view. Even Jean Kirstein, his bitter rival, had admitted this, as he convinced over half a dozen recruits to consider joining the Survey Corps before the Battle of Trost.[60] Four years later, he made use of this skill consciously, as shown when he easily lifted Falco's spirits and convinced him to deliver a letter outside of Liberio, despite the fact that Eldians were usually forbidden from leaving the internment zone.[61]\n\nEren locates Willy's sister\nEren figures out the true location of the War Hammer Titan\nIn the years since the recovery of Shiganshina, Eren had shown remarkable progress in his analytical and tactical skills, both in and outside of battle. Apart from maintaining his cover as a Marleyan soldier for an extended period of time and procuring a method of transporting his letters to the Survey Corps, Eren accurately guessed the source of Falco Grice's injuries and the reason why he wanted to become the next Armored Titan.[62] Later on, he successfully led Reiner into a trap, and in his battle against Lara Tybur, he quickly deduced the true location of the War Hammer Titan.[63] When he was unable to crack the crystal encasing her with his Attack Titan's jaws, he was resourceful enough to use the Jaw Titan's jaws as an improvised nutcracker to kill her and obtain the War Hammer Titan.[64]\n\nEren was aided in this by his unnervingly stoic and calm demeanor he developed since infiltrating Marley, never losing his composure and usually wearing a blank expression on his face, no matter how dire or stressful the situation may be. Although he admitted to becoming angry when Koslow traumatized Eldian soldiers, he remained outwardly unfazed during the incident. Additionally, he appeared to have become less proud overall, thanking Mikasa for helping him, which he normally used to dislike and criticize her for.[65]\n\nHis infiltration of Marley had given him a change in perspective regarding his enemies. After spending time as a Marleyan soldier, he came to understand that his enemies were people no different from his own. Because of this, he deeply empathized with Reiner and the other Warriors who were sent to Paradis Island, letting go of his desire to kill them in revenge for attacking his home and stating that they were simply victims. Nevertheless, he still prioritized his personal mission of destroying Paradis' enemies for the sake of his and his people's freedom,[66] regardless of how many lives were lost on either side. Furthermore, this personal mission had driven him enough that he unleashed all of the Wall Titans and declared he will trample the entire world to exterminate all life outside of the island\n\nEren was ready and willing to use many unethical means to achieve his goals, such as when he declared war against Marley, making the entire world his enemy. Eren abused the young child Falco's trust, fully aware of his family's precarious situation, and eventually killed numerous of innocent Eldian civilians (including children) as collateral damage in a surprise attack on Willy Tybur.[68]\n\nIn spite of this, he seemed to have developed a dislike for war, referring to it as \"hell.\" He believed that, with good reason, no one would want to go to war if they knew the suffering it would put them through.[69] He also showed sympathy for the Eldians living in the world's internment zones, as well as towards Ramzi and his refugee family living without freedom in Marley. While walking through Marley he expressed regret and inner conflict with his future actions towards people outside the Walls as he recognized many of them were innocent people.\n\nEren's time-serving in the Marley Mid-East War also seemed to have had an effect on his psyche to some extent. While he had shown great sorrow for comrades who have died on expeditions,[70] and had demonstrated a great amount of compassion for his fellow graduates from the 104th,[71] he laughed upon hearing that Sasha Blouse's final words were \"meat;\" although he changed his reaction and was seen about to cry after Jean Kirstein accused him of being responsible for her death and remembered Sasha's conviction that they would have more sheep and cows after recovering Wall Maria."

There are those who would get in my way. But I'm fine playing the role of the lunatic who kills people like that. I have to be ready to rearrange some faces. Because I choose the hell of humans killing each other over the hell of being eaten.\nLEVI EXPLAINS HIS MENTALITY TO HIS SQUAD\n\nLevi Ackerman (リヴァイ・アッカーマン Rivai Akkāman?), often formally referred to as Captain Levi (リヴァイ兵長 Rivai Heichō?), is the squad captain (兵士長 Heishichō?, lit. \"leader of the soldiers\") of the Special Operations Squad within the Survey Corps and is widely known as humanity's strongest soldier.[1]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nLevi has short, straight black hair styled in an undercut curtain, as well as narrow, intimidating dull gray eyes with dark circles under them and a deceptively youthful face. He is quite short, but his physique is well-developed in musculature from extensive vertical maneuvering equipment usage. He is usually either frowning or expressionless; that, plus his extremely calm demeanor, often makes it difficult for others to guess what he is thinking.\n\nHe is most often seen in his Survey Corps uniform, with a light gray button-up shirt underneath, along with his trademark white ascot. When embarking on expeditions outside the Walls, he also wears the Survey Corps' green hooded cloak. Once, when forced to take leave from his duties due to injury, Levi was seen in a black suit, plain white shirt, ascot, and dress shoes.[18] However, since the beginning of the coup d'état, he has left the ascot off. For most of the time during which the Survey Corps was on the run from the military and monarchy, he simply wore his vertical maneuvering equipment harness over casual clothes.[19]\n\nAfter a close-encounter explosion from a Thunder Spear set off by Zeke Yeager,[20] Levi now has several scars across his face including one across his right eye and is missing both the index and middle fingers on his right hand.[21]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nAs a result of his early childhood years, Levi is described as a \"clean freak\" by those who know him personally as he prefers his environment and himself to be spotlessly clean. He is averse to having either himself or his equipment soiled, and has been known to wipe down his blood-smeared blades while still on the battlefield. However, he will not hesitate to touch filth if he deems it necessary.[22][23]\n\nLevi is serious about cleaning\nLevi shows his obsession with cleaning\nDespite his preoccupation with cleanliness, Levi is not very approachable. He rarely shows emotion, giving a cold impression to others. His manner of speaking tends to be very blunt, even insulting, and his comments are often coarse or inappropriate. He is not above provoking or belittling those who oppose or irritate him. His sense of humor tends toward the vulgar, insulting, and dark. All of this makes him unsettling to a great number of people.\n\nIn his pre-Survey Corps criminal life, when he lived in the Underground City, Levi refused to take orders from anyone (as Petra Ral tells Eren), though he placed a great trust in his comrades, something he would later do with his subordinates. However, after he joined the Survey Corps, he came to greatly respect Commander Erwin Smith, whose orders he follows willingly because he trusts in Erwin's vision for the Corps.\n\nLevi's obedience is strictly limited to individuals he respects, and he has no problem showing open disdain for authority from anyone outside of this circle. At Eren's tribunal, he insulted the merchants by calling them \"pigs\" and told the Military Police that they were not competent enough to handle Eren,[24] mocking several MPs by observing that they have never battled or even seen a single Titan. He even sardonically suggests that they join the Survey Corps, which caused them to back off. He openly resents most of the MPs for their continual attempts to undermine the Survey Corps, and also presumably because of the criminal life he led before he joined the Corps.\n\nAlthough he rarely shows it, Levi has a strong sense of morality and empathy. One of his most defining characteristics is the great value he places on preserving human life; this is especially shown when it was revealed that all Titans might have once been human themselves. The thought that he had unknowingly been killing humans all this time disturbs him greatly. Though Levi bore no malice against Eren, he was willing to resort to violence in order to save his life at his tribunal, eventually asking Eren whether he resented him for the beating. Levi himself has stated that he hates unnecessary casualties, and he tells his subordinates to use their judgment so that they can avoid blunders that may cost them their lives.\n\nLevi beats Eren\nLevi beats up Eren at the military tribunal\nBecause of their hazardous profession and his personal values, he cares greatly for his subordinates' welfare. This is seen several times: when ordered to retreat early to Wall Rose at the end of the disastrous 57th Expedition, Levi was visibly distressed that so many of his soldiers had died on a fruitless mission. Later, he risked his life against the Female Titan in order to retrieve Eren from her mouth and also to protect to Mikasa, who had gone after her recklessly looking for vengeance. As they re-entered the gate, Petra's father approached him, cheerfully talking about his daughter and her unwavering devotion to the Survey Corps. Unbeknownst to him, his daughter had just been killed; Levi remained silent, he was too overcome with grief to reply. Levi was visibly affected by the loss of his entire original Special Operations Squad at the hands of the Female Titan, stating that he carries the will of his fallen comrades, and that their collective grudge against the Titans further strengthens his resolve to continue to fight.\n\nDespite his obedience to Erwin, Levi operates rather independently. Many of his Titan kills are solo, accomplished with little direct cooperation from other soldiers (due to him usually assigning them to hunt other Titans in the vicinity). Although he is looked up to by many, and he does not hesitate to give orders when necessary, Levi does not see himself as a leader in the same way Erwin is. He does not seem to have much use for hierarchy in general, and he leaves decisions up to his subordinates as often as he can.\n\nThough Levi is aware that his battle skill is in a different league from that of almost any other human soldier alive, he is not arrogant about it, as he knows from experience that no human soldier is invulnerable. Few will argue with his claims that only he can handle certain difficult tasks, because he has proven his ability to accomplish them.\n\nWhile Levi shows loyalty and empathy for his comrades, he shows no mercy towards the Titans, slaughtering them indiscriminately with obvious indifference. However, when the Titans are former friends and subordinates, Levi can briefly hesitate and wonder if they are still aware of their actions while trapped inside their Titan forms; regardless, Levi has displayed no problem in killing them. When dealing with individuals he perceives to be enemies to mankind, Levi is capable of behaving sadistically, even vindictively. For example, when the Female Titan was captured, Levi relayed his enjoyment at watching her suffer and described in chilling detail how he intended to mutilate her human body. He has also tortured Djel Sannes with Hange Zoë, punching him and twisting his already broken nose. After defeating Zeke Yeager a second time, he sadistically made it clear that he was going to torture Zeke for his crimes against Paradis and the Survey Corps, impaling him with a Thunder Spear. Levi displays no emotion during these times aside from bloodlust, shown by his methodically slicing apart Zeke's legs.[25]\n\nLevi is occasionally known to lose his calm demeanor and to use threats or violence to get others to listen to him, even if they are fellow members of the corps. An example of such behavior was shown when he directly ordered Historia Reiss to take on the role of queen when the question was presented to her. When she shakily says she is unfit, he grabs her and lifts her off the ground, choking her and telling her to fight back if she does not like it. He then drops her and yells at her to make her decision, but is however calm once again when she complies with his demands.[26]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHistory\n\nKenny meets Levi\nA young Levi and Kenny met\nLevi was born the son of Kuchel Ackerman, a prostitute who worked in the Underground and was made pregnant by one of her clients. One day, Kenny Ackerman, Kuchel's older brother, came to the city to see her only to find that she was dead.[27] There, he found a young and squalid Levi sitting in front of his mother's bed.\n\nIn a rare showing of compassion, Kenny decided to take care of him. He raised Levi as well as he could: teaching him knife skills, how to get along with people, and violent behavior. Levi also learned to use his own inner power that he possessed as a member of the Ackerman clan.[28]\n\nFollowing his mother's death, Levi attempted to steal back a tea set she had sold in order to pay for food. He was caught in the act and the merchants, after apprehending him, considered selling him into slavery. Levi, disgusted by their behavior, attempted to resist and was nearly beaten to death. However, before the merchants could finish him off his Ackerman blood awakened and he killed all of them in a moment of blind rage. After calming down, he was confronted by the sole surviving merchant who attempted to blackmail Levi into sparing his by arguing that his friends would hunt Levi down and kill him in retribution unless he left the merchant alive to talk them down. Levi simply retorted that no one would believe that a child had killed them before throwing the merchant to his death.\n\nReturning to his home, Levi made himself a cup of tea using her set. However, when he attempted to drink it the handle broke, causing him to drop and shatter the cup. From that point on, Levi refused to hold cups by their handles, choosing to hold them by their brims instead.[29]\n\nTime passed and eventually, Kenny taught Levi everything he knew. However, he did not consider himself as a good father figure.[30][31] One day, in the subterranean city, Levi started a fight which he won easily. At that moment, Kenny decided to leave him behind, satisfied that he had taught Levi the skills he needed to survive.[32]\n\nLater, he became a notorious thug in the underground but eventually left the place to join the Survey Corps.[3] Although at one point he was at odds with Erwin Smith,[33] he ended up becoming one of his most trusted men."

And yet...so beautiful....\nMIKASA'S PERSONAL OUTLOOK ON THE WORLD\n\nMikasa Ackerman (ミカサ・アッカーマン Mikasa Akkāman?) is one of the two deuteragonists of the series, along with Armin Arlert.\n\nAfter her parents were murdered by human traffickers, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager and lived with him and his parents, Grisha and Carla, before the fall of Wall Maria. She is the last descendant of the Shogun clan that stayed on Paradis Island, thereby related to the Azumabito family, and holds significant political power in Hizuru.[12]\n\nThough she desires only to live a peaceful life, Mikasa entered into the military—where she is considered the best soldier among the 104th Training Corps. She later enlists in the Survey Corps to follow and protect Eren, becoming one of its greatest assets. She is currently serving as an officer (上官 Jōkan?) in the Corps.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\nMikasa is a fairly tall and well-toned woman. She is of partial Asian heritage, with pale skin, gray eyes, and shaggy black hair that was long until she cut it to chin-length. By the year 854, her hair is shorter and cut up to the back of her neck, though she simultaneously wears noticeably longer bangs. She bears a tattoo of the Azumabito family crest on the outside of her right wrist. There is a small scar below her right eye, which was due to an injury delivered by Eren's Titan during the Battle of Trost District.[13] By 857, Mikasa's hair grew noticeably long and is tied in a ponytail.[14]\n\nMikasa often wears the original Survey Corps uniform, whose equipment is horizontally at her hips, with a white blouse underneath and a black scarf that she almost always wears.[15] She also wears a green cape with the wings of freedom on the back during some missions.\n\nWhen off duty, Mikasa's casual attire consists of a simple knee-length white dress, a light cardigan, brown boots, and her signature black scarf.\n\nWhile in Marley, Mikasa wears a black Survey Corps uniform, which features a breastplate with the Survey Corps symbol; many belts to accommodate all the different gear; support rods around her chest for the gas canister; and tall black boots. She also carries guns, thunder spears, an additional gas tank, and canisters running vertically down her legs.[16]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nBefore living with the Yeager family, Mikasa appeared to be a cheerful, outgoing, and gentle child. Her innocence allowed her to push anxious thoughts to the back of her mind, continuing to live with her parents and loved ones happily. Growing up, Mikasa has become emotionally withdrawn and noticeably dangerous, sometimes intimidating her enemies or even her comrades. She is quite stoic and level headed, rarely seen to lose her cool or be at a loss of what to do, no matter how bleak the situation seems to be. Her will is remarkably strong, demonstrated when she managed to remain so outwardly calm when Eren was presumed dead; only Armin could tell that she was battling with the pain of losing him.[17]\n\nMikasa cares deeply for her friends and caretakers, seeing them as the last remnants of a family she cannot afford to lose.[18] She also appears to have a soft spot for children, evidenced by her bowing to a young girl she saved and her instantly saving a Marleyan soldier, despite the latter having earlier killed one of her comrades. Mikasa is not completely immune to the effects of her emotions, however: Her strong feelings for her beloved ones, particularly when they are in harm's way, does at times cloud her judgment in fury—sometimes to the endangerment of herself and others.[19] A notable example was when Mikasa briefly gave in to her grief over Eren's apparent demise and lost the will to live, forgetting her responsibility for the lives of the soldiers she took upon herself to lead in the process. However, she was reawakened by her memories of Eren and a made decision to never give up again, as her memories would die with her.\n\nMikasa worries for Eren\nMikasa's protective attitude towards Eren\nFrom an early age, Mikasa was unusually perceptive, aware of the harshness of nature by witnessing the manner in which predators hunt and kill weaker prey. Her peace was shattered when a band of criminals brutally murdered her parents before her eyes in a failed kidnapping attempt, only saving herself and her rescuer when she managed to abandon all inhibition and hesitation to kill one of her assailants.[20] Following this traumatic event, Mikasa would gain a generally cynical outlook on life and accept the world as a cruel place where only those who are strong are able to survive.[21] Her determination to protect her beloved ones as much as possible has contributed greatly to her phenomenal skills as a soldier. Though being among the best of the best, she remains humble and refrains from putting on airs or displaying arrogance.\n\nMikasa has a strong sense of right and wrong, doing everything she can to make her most impulsive friends follow what she thinks is the right track.[22] In spite of this, she is well aware that she cannot always sway them in decisions and makes it a point to follow them wherever they go, just so that she can be around to help out when trouble arises.[23] The sole reason she enlisted in the military and joined the Survey Corps after her graduation was to keep an eye on Eren, despite the fact that she truly wished to live out the rest of her days in relative peace within the Walls alongside him.\n\nMikasa's bond with Eren is undoubtedly her most important relationship and the one that defines her. Her personality as a teenager was very much influenced by Eren, who told her she stood no chance of survival if she did not fight for it.[24] His words continued to stay with her, and she automatically recalled them to spur her on when she was close to death. Mikasa wears the black scarf Eren gave her when they first met, holding on to it as a source of strength and comfort when she is upset.[25] She had openly wept tears of relief at his safety and developed vengeful grudges towards those who harm him, from enemies to her own superiors. She blushed when it was insinuated she and Eren were lovers;[26] furthermore, after he insulted her and stated that he had always hated her, she was visibly hurt and eventually left behind the scarf he had given her.[27]\n\nWhile she would regain the scarf from Louise,[28] Mikasa would not wear it again until moments before confronting Eren following his initiation of the Rumbling.[29] Mikasa's sacrifice of a life with her beloved Eren and choosing to defy and kill him is ultimately the reason Ymir Fritz was freed and the Titans vanishing from the world.[30] Mikasa grieves for Eren as she visits his grave,[14] and would continue to regularly visit it with her new family for several decades until passing away of old age while wearing the scarf.[31]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHistory\n\nMikasa was born to an Asian mother, and her father was a member of the Ackerman clan.[32] She lived peacefully with her parents in the farmlands of Wall Maria, helping them since a young age. Mikasa underwent a painful scarring ritual from her mother, who cut into her skin the mark of their family.[33]\n\nEren gives Mikasa his scarf\nEren gave Mikasa his scarf\nBeing the last of their race made her mother and Mikasa high value targets to robbers. When she was only 9 years old, a group of traffickers killed her parents and attempted to kidnap her for the purpose of selling her in the human-trading market of the Capital's Underground.[32] Frightened and shocked, Mikasa was rescued by Eren Yeager, the son of her family's doctor. He tricked and killed two of the kidnappers, but he was overwhelmed by the third trafficker and on the verge of being strangled. Eren desperately urged Mikasa to fight to win, who came to realize that the world can be callous and merciless before dispatching the robber from behind, who was trying to kill him.\n\nWhen Grisha Yeager arrived with members of the Military Police Brigade, Mikasa was given the scarf by Eren and accepted into his family. This event awakened the fighting instincts and perfect self-control that runs in the Ackerman clan.[34] Mikasa then went to live with Eren's family until the Fall of Wall Maria.[35]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStory\n\nPrologue arc\n\nMikasa wakes up Eren\nMikasa wakes Eren up\nMikasa appears for the first time in year 845 somewhere inside Wall Maria. She is seen waking Eren up, telling him that they need to return to home. She is surprised to see tears in his eyes and asks why he was crying.[36] On their way home, they meet Hannes. Mikasa watches as Eren complains about the soldiers slacking off while on duty.[37] Later, both Eren and Mikasa watch the return of the Survey Corps forces, witnessing yet another failure of their expedition.[38] After returning home, Mikasa tells on Eren, revealing to his parents his desire to join the Survey Corps. Annoyed, Eren leaves, with Mikasa following him. They save Armin, who is being beaten by local bullies and together discuss their desire to go outside the Walls.[39]\n\nEren, Mikasa, and Armin see the Colossus Titan\nMikasa, Eren and Armin see the Colossus Titan\nAt that moment, the three kids witness the sudden appearance of an extremely tall Titan peering over the top of Wall Maria. The three are stunned to see one that large, only coming back to their senses when the Titan breaches the Wall's gate.[40][41] Mikasa and Eren run back to their home to find it crushed and Carla trapped under the debris.[42] In spite of their attempts, Mikasa and Eren are unable to free her, Hannes rescues them as a Titan devours Eren's mother.[43] Mikasa and Eren are placed on a ship just as the Armored Titan breaks through the inner gate, letting the Titans inside Wall Maria. She witnesses Eren's vow to kill all the Titans as they are transported to safety.[44]\n\n104th Training Corps arc\n\nAfter the events of the Wall Maria's destruction, the government's desperate attempt to reclaim the lands using the refugees leads to nothing but more casualties. This prompts Mikasa, Eren, and Armin to enroll with the army and become members of the 104th Training Corps.[45]\n\nDuring their training, Mikasa helps Eren as much as she can as he initially fails to grasp the basics of the vertical maneuvering equipment.[46] They manage to pass the qualifying tests, Mikasa quickly proving her skills and is praised as one of the best trainees in military history.[47] At one point, Mikasa asks Annie Leonhart, a fellow trainee with exceptional skill, to teach her a self-defense technique that she was teaching Eren, which eventually calls for a bet with the 104th Training Corps to see who is the stronger fighter.[48] Their fight is eventually interrupted by an instructor, and ends in a draw.[49]\n\nAt the 104th Training Corps' graduation, she is ranked first in the class.[3]\n\nWall Sealing arc\n\nAs the Survey Corps parade through the street on its way to the gates, Mikasa, Eren and Armin stare at Captain Levi in amazement.[50]\n\nLater that day, before having the chance to fully apply in the Survey Corps so she can keep Eren safe, the Colossus Titan breaches Wall Rose the same way it did with Wall Maria.[51] Much to her dismay, Mikasa is assigned to the rear guard to help fend off the Titans while the civilians escape into the safety of Wall Sheena.[52] Before fulfilling her duty, she makes Eren promise her not to do anything reckless.[53]\n\nMikasa kills a Titan\nMikasa kills the abnormal Titan\nLater on, as an abnormal Titan approaches the escaping civilians who are blocked at the gate. Mikasa kills it, saving everyone.[54] She then witnesses why the civilians are taking too long to escape; an overloaded cargo cart is blocking the way. Mikasa asks the businessman to move the cart so that the people could escape, but when he refuses, she has to resort threatening him after knocking his guards unconscious, which scares the man enough to relent and move his goods.[55] Seeing a mother and daughter show their gratitude for saving them, Mikasa flashes back to the time she lost her own parents and realizes that Eren is the only family she has left.[56] With the evacuation of Trost District citizens complete, she heads to the front guard in order to aid her comrades.[57]\n\nMikasa finds that, because the supply team has barricaded itself inside the military headquarters, the surviving trainees no longer have enough gas to retreat.[58] Noticing that Eren is not present, Mikasa confronts Armin and learns that Eren was devoured by a Titan. Despite his clear regret, Mikasa calmly comforts Armin and explains that they must not get emotional in their present predicament. Mikasa rallies the remaining trainees and leads them in a last ditch effort to reach the headquarters.[59]\n\nBecause of her grief over Eren's death, Mikasa rushes ahead of her comrades and quickly expends all of her gas, stranding herself in the middle of Trost.[17] As two Titans close in on her, she contemplates giving up but is motivated to keep fighting by memories of Eren.[60] When Mikasa stands up to kill the Titan in front of her, another Titan comes running from behind and saves her.[61] This Titan, which ignores Mikasa, gives Armin enough time to rescue Mikasa and they both continue heading to the supply HQ.[62] As they watch the Attack Titan continue killing other Titans, they hatch a plan to lure it to the HQ and relieve the siege there.[63] With its help, the trainees manage to successfully refill their gas tanks and have clear access to the Wall"

I...to give countless people joy, I gave up my life. But from that time, there was a wish I held in my heart. If someday, I was given a second chance at life...this time...I would live for no one but myself.\nYMIR ABOUT HER PAST LIFE\n\nYmir (ユミル Yumiru?) was a graduate of the 104th Cadet Corps and a former member of the Scout Regiment. She also had the ability to transform into the Jaw Titan, and had knowledge about the true nature of Titans and the history of the world outside the Walls.[7]\n\n\nAppearance\n\n\nHuman form\n\nYmir was a tall, slender young woman with intimidating brown eyes and middle-parted hair often styled into a ponytail with long bangs at the sides framing her face. She has disheveled-looking brown hair held back with a red tie and usually wears the uniform of the Scout Regiment. During her final days on Paradis Island and leading up to her death, Ymir wore dark pants and a white long sleeve shirt.\n\nWhen Ymir was revered as a goddess, she wore a pale halter dress with a belt and her hair down.\n\nJaw Titan form\n\nYmir's Titan form, the Jaw Titan, was considerably smaller than most Titans, standing at 5 m[8] and is the second shortest intelligent Titan thus far. It had rugged dark hair, small black eyes, a large nose, small pointed ears, and long arms. Its most distinct traits were sharp fangs and claws. Unlike others with the power of the Titans, the body is not well-proportioned because her head is too big. Unlike the Female Titan, her Titan form possesses no distinct, feminine features. Overall, it lacks the distinct similarity to her human form that the majority of other intelligent Titans show.\n\nPure Titan form\n\nPrior to eating Marcel Galliard, her Titan form was noticeably thinner, and her rib cage was more pronounced, her teeth were also straight and not sharp.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nInitially, Ymir appears selfish, cynical, uncooperative, exploitative and confrontational, but later reveals kindness, especially around Historia. She often criticized people for being untrue to themselves, as when she berated Sasha Braus, who developed an extremely polite and formal way of speaking to hide her native accent.\n\nAfter regaining her human form, she resolved to proudly live for herself only, thinking it as the best revenge against all those who hated her for her mere existence, and those who had used Ymir for their own purposes. While not completely willing to trust Reiner and Bertholdt, she betrayed the Scouts in exchange for Christa's safety. Due to their similar background and painful experiences, Historia was one of the few people she truly cares about, wishing to protect her at any cost.\n\nYmir was extremely perceptive and could discern the nature of the people around her with alarming accuracy, such as Historia's martyrdom mentality, Reiner's split personality disorder, and Sasha's desire to look good in front of her peers by hiding her native accent and developing an extremely polite and formal way of speaking. Due to her experiences and belief in self-pride, she tended to rudely criticize people for being untrue to themselves.\n\nOddly, her personality appeared to be a foil of Christa. Due to her dark past, Christa often pretends to be a sweet girl so that others will remember her fondly. However, her true nature is darker, more depressing, and lonely. Ymir's true persona appears to be much more selfless and quite emotional, which is shown when she accepted Reiner and Bertholdt's offer to return to their hometown in exchange for Christa's safety. She saves Erwin Smith's life, even though she blames him for her plan to ensure Christa's future failing. It should also be noted that she shows considerable regret over devouring Marcel, who was Reiner Braun, Bertholdt Hoover and Annie Leonhart's friend, regardless of the fact she did not do it consciously and showed gratitude to them later on since their arrival is what caused her to regain her human form.\n\nWhile Ymir was not arrogant, her pride was what defined her character the most. She repeatedly claimed to only do things for herself, often rejecting the notion that she is putting herself out there or at risk for others' sake. Her pride prevented her from revealing her Titan ability and any extremely valuable information to the Scout Regiment.\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHistory\n\nSubjects of Ymir\nYmir was given a false name and followers\nMany decades ago, a nameless, homeless, Eldian girl lived in the streets of Marley as a beggar. When she was four years old,[9] she was found by a man who gave her the name \"Ymir,\" after the ancient Ymir Fritz and brought her into a cult dedicated to the worship of Ymir. She was worshiped by many Eldians in the cult, and Ymir chose to abide by her new role in order to bring happiness to those around her. However, when she was eleven years old,[9] the cult was discovered by the Marley Public Security, and the man who named her claimed she had deceived him. Ymir chose to abide by her given name, and she was arrested with the other cultists. After being paraded around Marley and stoned by angry citizens, the cultists were taken to the borderline of Paradis Island and forcibly turned into Pure Titans.[10]\n\nYmir wandered through the country outside of the Walls for about sixty years searching for humans to consume. Eventually, Ymir fell into a ditch and was slowly submerged in the earth as it settled over her and would remain in this state for an unknown length of time.[10]\n\nYmir's freedom\nYmir woke up human again\nIn the year 845, Ymir sensed and encountered the Warriors Reiner Braun, Bertholdt Hoover, Annie Leonhart and Marcel Galliard as they were venturing to the Walls, and emerged from her imprisonment to feed on them. Ymir tried to consume Reiner, but at the last moment, Marcel pushed him away as Ymir grabbed and consumed him instead, as Reiner and Bertholdt watched in horror. Later that night Ymir reverted back to her human form as a result of consuming Marcel in a desert, and when she saw the beautiful night sky she laughed for the first time in years. Eventually, Ymir found her way to the Walls and became a street thief within the interior.[10]\n\nSometime later, while scavenging for food in a church she overheard a conversation between members of the Order of the Walls, regarding an illegitimate child of the royal family who was given the name \"Christa Lenz\" and sent off to the Cadet Corps. Upon hearing one of them express annoyance at her very existence Ymir felt pity for Christa, sympathizing with her position.[10] In the year 847 Ymir enlisted in the 104th Cadet Corps to find Christa.[11]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nStory\n\nIlse's Notebook: Notes from a Scout Regiment Member\n\nIn the year 849, Ilse Langnar, a member of the Scout Regiment that resembled Ymir, encountered a Titan that spoke of her as a \"subject of Ymir.\" This Titan mistook Ilse for Ymir, and bowed before her while referring to her as \"Lady Ymir.\" Ilse's notes of the encounter were later discovered by Hange Zoë and are the first hints of Ymir's true nature.[12]\n\nHumanity's Comeback arc\n\nOn the first day of training, Ymir and Christa venture outside and fetch refreshments for Sasha after her 5 hour-long run as a punishment. Ymir acts apathetic and shows little care for Sasha's well-being, telling Christa that she could use Sasha's stupidity to her advantage.[11]\n\nYmir confronts Sasha\nYmir confronts Sasha\nAt a later time during their training, Ymir confronts Sasha about speaking in an overly polite tone, rather than her home's dialect. Ymir begins to criticize her for it, and Christa scolds her and claims that Sasha should speak however she wants to.[13]\n\nAt some point during training, the cadets complete a snowstorm training exercise, arriving at a base at the foot of a mountain. After their fellow cadet Daz loses consciousness during the exercise, Christa elects to try to pull his body along on a cot, despite Ymir's protests. Ymir argues that they will only survive if they abandon Daz and head for base together, but Christa insists that they could all survive if Ymir goes ahead of her. Noticing that Christa has not asked for help during their entire course, Ymir deduces Christa has no intention of saving Daz nor herself, and that she is using their situation as an excuse to die in a heroic way.\n\nYmir overhear Christa's case\nYmir overhears Christa's case\nYmir reveals that she is aware of Christa's true past, having heard officials from the Order of the Walls discussing her existence. Christa asks if Ymir joined the Cadet Corps in order to find her, and Ymir proposes that it may be due to her own past being similar. Christa asks if Ymir originally wanted to befriend her, but Ymir says that they are nothing alike, as Ymir kept her old name after starting a new life, because abandoning her name would be to admit defeat. By living for herself, she robbed her enemies of their power. Ymir scolds Christa for looking for death rather than directing her feelings towards her enemies, and Christa says that there is no longer any way for all three of them to survive their mission.\n\nYmir leads Christa to a cliff overlooking the base at the foot of the mountain and proposes tossing Daz over the edge so that she and Christa can make it to the base alive while Daz could be searched for later. When Christa objects, Ymir takes matters into her own hands and throws her aside into a snowbank. She then transforms, and uses her Titan form to carry Daz down the mountain to base camp.\n\nYmir and Christa making their promise\nYmir pleads with Christa to make a promise\nWhen Christa arrives, Ymir shows her that Daz was safe indoors. Ymir decides to reveal to Christa how she saved Daz, but only if she promises to live by her true name when her secret eventually becomes known to everyone.[3]\n\nYmir graduates in the 104th Cadet Corps outside the top 10, which Christa deems that she deserved to be there more than her. It is implied that she intentionally gives less than her full effort so that Christa could have the 10th slot. After graduation, she follows Christa into the Scout Regiment.[14]\n\nThe Struggle for Trost arc\n\nYmir jokes with Historia\nYmir asks Historia to marry her\nYmir is stationed in Trost District when the Colossal Titan breaches Wall Rose. During the battle, her squad discovers a catatonic Armin. Conny Springer tries to get Armin to tell them what happened, and Ymir observes that Armin is likely the only survivor of his squad. She callously declares that Armin's survival was not worth losing the rest of his squad mates. Conny grows angry at her attitude and Christa is forced to mediate between them. In response, Ymir requests that Christa marry her once the battle is over.[15]\n\nYmir and Christa volunteer to help supply other soldiers during the battle and are split up from Conny. They are eventually placed on standby with other surviving cadets, where Conny fills them in on what happened to the cadets at the military's headquarters. She is surprised to see that Mikasa is not present among the survivors, but when the group asks Jean what happened to her, he claims that he was ordered not to tell.\n\nEve of the Counterattack arc\n\nYmir is present among other cadets during Commander Erwin Smith's speech to join the Scout Regiment. After the commander tells about the grim future that awaits new Scout members, many cadets leave. She is among the few that remain and get accepted into the regiment. She tells Christa to leave when she sees her about to cry.[16]\n\nThe 57th Exterior Scouting Mission arc\n\nYmir participates in the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission. In the Forest of Giant Trees, she is positioned atop the trees with other soldiers to prevent Titans from entering the forest.[17] She asks Bertholdt about Christa's location, to which he says he does not know. After a loud Titan scream is heard from the forest, Ymir is shocked to see hordes of Titans rush into it. Sometime later, she sees the retreat signal for the mission.[18] Ymir safely returns to Wall Rose with the remainder Scouts from the failed expedition.[19]\n\nClash of the Titans arc\n\nAfter Nanaba reports that Wall Rose has been breached, the Scouts are ordered to go on horseback and evacuate local citizens near-by. Ymir is seen next to Christa Lenz on her horse, accompanied by Nanaba and Henning. Both the recruits are devoid of their omni-directional mobility gear and Ymir initially voices refusal to be a part of the team as being unarmed would make them extremely vulnerable to Titans.[20]\n\nYmir transforms into a Titan\nYmir transforms into a Titan\nAfter the Western and Southern teams take refuge inside Utgard Castle, Ymir comes under suspicion by Reiner when she is able to read the label of a herring can in an unknown writing correctly and he comes to suspect that she may know more than what she is letting on.[7] When the castle comes under attack by Titans capable of moving at night, the four equipped Scouts are killed and the remaining rookies are left under danger of the tower collapsing. Resolving to use her Titan to save her comrades, Ymir orders Christa to live a life she will be proud of and asks her to remember a promise that they made earlier before Ymir jumping from the tower and cutting herself with the knife to trigger her transformation.[7]\n\nYmir battles at Utgard\nYmir battles the Titans at Utgard Castle\nYmir fights the Titans strategically, utilizing her speed and agility to avoid attacks and aim for Titans' napes. However, she is forced to hamper her movement to avoid doing any more damage to the tower. Christa, realizing that Ymir is risking her life to save them, orders Ymir to tear the wall down and Ymir complies. As the tower collapses, Ymir orders her comrades to grab her Titan so that they will be safe. The tower completely collapses, burying the Titans under the rubble.[3]\n\nTitans devouring Ymir's Titan form\nThe Titans begin to devour Ymir\nWhen the Titans begin to emerge from the wreckage, Ymir immediately reengages them. However, she is pushed to her limit and the Titans overpower her and begin devouring her. Christa runs to the Titan horde, begging Ymir to stay alive so that Christa could reveal her real name. Ymir and the recruits are saved by the timely arrival of Hange's squad, which proceeds to slay all the remaining Titans in the vicinity. Before Ymir passes out in the aftermath, Christa reveals that her true name is \"Historia.\"[3]\n\nHistoria holds Ymir\nHistoria cradles a wounded Ymir\nThe Scouts regroup atop Wall Rose and Ymir is brought up via a lift. Historia speaks to Hange on Ymir's behalf, claiming that she is undoubtedly an ally to humanity. While Hange is skeptical, they note that it would obviously be for the best if they could all get along and work together, stating that Ymir's information could be a treasure to humanity.[21] Shortly after, Reiner and Bertholdt reveal themselves as the Armored and Colossal Titans. While Reiner fights Eren, Bertholdt partially transforms into the Colossal Titan[21] and swallows Ymir and another soldier.[22] He and Reiner manages to escape with Ymir and Eren.[23]\n\nAfterward, Reiner and Bertholdt arrive at a forest and take a break high in the branches. Ymir waits for her limbs to grow back while Eren regains consciousness, missing both of his arms.[23] He is impatient and wants to fight his way out, but Ymir pragmatically points out that he does not have much of a chance. They are surrounded by Titans at the base of the trees and Reiner and Bertholdt are the only ones with omni-directional mobility gear.[24] Ymir asks Reiner why he stopped rather than going all the way to Wall Maria. He does not answer, but she deduces that he is waiting for night when the Titans will be less active.[24]\n\nYmir figures out Reiner's personality\nYmir figures out Reiner's split personality\nAs they wait for sunset, Reiner begins talking strangely about promotions and how hard they have been working. Ymir realizes that Reiner has fractured his personality to cope with the guilt over being friends with the people he is trying to kill and begins mocking him.[24] Ymir asks if Reiner and Bertholdt are trying to meet up with the \"monkey\" they saw back at Utgard Castle, positing that they might need it to return home. Eren realizes that Ymir knows much more than he does and pushes her for answers, but before she can say anything Reiner offers her a deal. They cannot promise her safety, but they are willing to work with her in order to protect Christa.[24]\n\nWhile the sun is still up, Reiner and Bertholdt prepare to move out without explanation. Bertholdt asks Ymir if she remembers who she ate when she regained her human form. She admits she does not but apologizes when she realizes that it was probably a comrade of his. Bertholdt is surprisingly understanding, saying that he similarly does not remember. He asks her how long she had been wandering as a Titan and Ymir says it was about sixty years, like she was stuck in a nightmare that would never end.[10]\n\nThe group flees using their ODM with Reiner carrying an unconscious Eren and Bertholdt carrying Ymir. As they leave, Ymir looks back and sees the signal flares announcing the arrival of the Scout Regiment. Believing that Christa is too good-natured to not be among the rescuers, Ymir tells them this is their chance to grab her. Reiner refuses, saying that their chances of succeeding are too low, but Ymir fears she will be eaten by another Warrior before that happens and she will never have another chance to see Christa. Bertholdt and Reiner try to reassure her that they will rescue Christa later, but Ymir wonders if accepting that means she will be lying to herself again.[10] Ymir interferes with Bertholdt's maneuvering and threatens to take Eren back to the Scouts if she does not get her way.[10]\n\nYmir takes Historia\nYmir kidnaps Historia\nYmir transforms and meets the pursuing soldiers alone in the forest, where Conny recognizes her and tells the others not to attack. She looks around until she spots Christa, who she captures in her mouth. Ymir then turns around and swings from tree to tree to escape. Reiner and Bertholdt are waiting for her at the edge of the forest. On seeing her, Reiner transforms into the Armored Titan and begins running while Bertholdt grapples onto his shoulder with Eren. Ymir jumps onto his back and he carries them away.[10] As they flee, Ymir removes Christa from her Titan's mouth and partially emerges from the nape. She calls apologizes for eating her and tells her that she is going with Reiner and Bertholdt for her safety.[4]\n\nHistoria tells Ymir she is not making sense\nHistoria tells Ymir she is not making sense\nHistoria does not believe Ymir and offers to help her fight off Reiner and Bertholdt, saying she will always be her ally. Though Ymir wavers, she decides she cannot let Historia go. Ymir expects she will be killed to retrieve the power of the Titans she stole, but if she hands Historia over Reiner and Bertholdt, they will speak on Ymir's behalf. She calls herself pathetic for doing this to save her own life, but Historia reassures her that she will still be on her side.[4]\n\nCommander Erwin Smith leads a horde of Titans into Reiner to stop him and Ymir is forced to defend Historia. In the chaos they are separated from Reiner and Bertholdt, but they manage to kill a Titan together.[4] As the battle intensifies, Ymir questions whether she is better off siding with the Warriors or the Scouts, but any way she looks at it, the chances inside the Walls are bleak.[25] They join Sasha and Conny in fending off the Titans around them when a newly freed Eren strikes a particular Titan with his bare hand, triggering a power which causes all the Pure Titans present to drop what they are doing in favor of devouring the one that had attacked Eren. As he runs away he screams and sends the Titans after Reiner and Bertholdt.[25]\n\nYmir with no regrets\nYmir reflects on her time as a goddess\nRealizing that Eren's power might guarantee a future for the Walls, Ymir looks back to see Reiner and Bertholdt are about to be overwhelmed. She apologizes to Historia and returns to help them, arriving in time to stop a Titan from eating Bertholdt. With her assistance, the three make it back to Wall Maria where Reiner asks her why she came back to them. Ymir calls herself an idiot, but that she will be a souvenir so they do not return empty-handed. If they had not come to break the Wall, she would never have woken from her nightmare, so she is going to return what she borrowed.[25]\n\nReturn to Shiganshina arc\n\nYmir writes a letter to Historia\nYmir writes a letter to Historia\nUpon being brought back to Marley by the Warriors, Ymir writes a letter for Historia explaining her past and asks that Reiner deliver it to her when he returns to Paradis Island.[26]\n\nAfter reading the letter, Historia receives a vision of Ymir chained in front of an unidentified person in a cave similar to the one under the Reiss family's chapel.[27]\n\nMarley arc\n\nYmir is about to be eaten\nYmir is about to be eaten\nAfter being brought back to Marley, Ymir willingly allowed herself to be killed and was eaten by Marcel Galliard's brother, Porco Galliard, transferring the power of the Jaw Titan to him. Porco mentions that when receiving Ymir's memories, Reiner appeared to be a very different person on Paradis Island than on Marley, accusing him of imitating Marcel's Warrior-like personality, which Reiner does not deny.[28]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nLegacy\n\nWar for Paradis arc\n\nThe deceased Titan possessors in the Paths\nYmir in the Paths\nYmir is one of the many Titan inheritors whose Titan is created by Ymir Fritz to defend Eren Jaeger while he is attempting to Rumble the world.[29] In the middle of the fighting Ymir and a handful of other inheritors are reawakened in the Path world by Zeke Jaeger. Zeke asks Ymir and the other inheritors to lend their strength to him and his allies.\n\nTaking control of her Titan, Ymir helps fend off the myriad Titans which are attempting to defend Eren. Ymir saves Reiner from death at the hands of a War Hammer Titan and continues to fight until Eren's nape is destroyed.[29]\n\nAbilities\n\nYmir possessed great physical ability in her human form - she had shown to be fully capable in combat and use of weapons. During her time as a cadet, it has been rumored that she started slacking off to ensure Historia a spot in the top ten.\nPower of the Titans\n\nYmir was able to transform herself into the Jaw Titan (顎の巨人 Agito no Kyojin?), a 5-meter Titan. She gained this ability after she ate Marcel, a Warrior from Marley, in the year 845.\n\nJaw: Her Titan form's sharp teeth allowed her to easily tear into a Titan's flesh.\nYmir's Titan agility\nYmir's Titan agility\nSpeed: Despite her small size, her Titan form had above average speed and agility, which made it easy for her to climb walls and trees in order to dispatch multiple enemies in quick succession by biting them in their nape while using her claws and sharp teeth, a tactic used several times by her. Against humans or other Titans in a forest, she had the advantage, as she would swiftly outmaneuver them. However, her small size has proven to be a problem, since she is easily overpowered by Titans not long after her transformation at Utgard Castle.[3]\nRegeneration: Like others with the power of the Titans, Ymir possessed the ability to automatically heal any injury and even regrow entire limbs. After she loses her right arm and leg at the battle of Utgard Castle, she is able to regenerate them in a matter of hours.[24]\nPartial Transformation: Ymir also possessed the ability to partially emerge from the nape of her Titan form, allowing her to interact with others while still transformed. This shows that she is skillful at controlling her Titan form.[4]\nCommunication: While others with the power of the Titans are unable to form words while transformed, she seems to be skilled enough to talk and being capable of coherent speech in her Titan form, though not as eloquently as Zeke Jaeger's Beast Titan or Pieck's Cart Titan.[20][30] She seems to find it difficult because she only says limited and short phrases, pausing between the words.[3]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRelationships\n\nHistoria Reiss - Ymir was romantically attracted to Historia, and utterly devoted to her. Historia was one of the few people Ymir truly cared about, and her primary goal was to protect her no matter the cost. The two had a strong connection, and deeply trusted each other even while keeping secrets. While not completely willing to trust Reiner and Bertholdt, she betrayed the Eldians of Paradis Island in exchange for Historia's safety. Even though doing so may endanger Historia's life, Ymir stated she was a horrible person that wanted to see her one more time, but only left her behind when she thought that Historia would be safe inside the Walls. Ymir actively worked to discourage Historia's martyr complex, and encouraged Historia to embrace her true identity and living her life with pride. Her influence in Historia was so strong that she even rejected to inherit the Founding Titan and fought her father. In her letter to Historia, Ymir says her only regret was being unable to marry her."

He was seen wearing no shirt, loose pants, combat boots, and circular glasses. After his return to Marley, and the four-year time skip, Zeke began to sport a much more clean-cut look, contrasting his look while on Paradis Island. He had his hair cut much shorter, so that it no longer fell into his eyes, and sported a thinner beard.[20]\n\nTitan form\n\nIn his Titan form, Zeke was an extremely unusual specimen, having a distinct, ape-like appearance. However, his posture was closer to that of a human's; like typical Titans, he walked bipedally. He stood at a previously unseen 17 meters in height. Dark fur covered a large part of his body, growing on his upper torso, shoulders, limbs, and groin, while also forming a beard and covering his scalp. His face, ears, extremities, and stomach were bare. He possessed pointed ears and teeth, unlike most Titans. The proportions of his upper body were similar to those of the Colossus Titan, possessing a very broad chest which dwarfed his head, as well as disproportionately slim arms. Additionally, his arms were elongated, with long fingers and very dexterous thumbs, allowing him to easily pick up delicate objects off the ground.[21] His Titan's eyes possessed dark sclera and irises, making it difficult to determine where he was looking at any given moment.[22]\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nZeke was a very intelligent and curious man. He tried to communicate with Mike Zacharias in order to get information about the vertical maneuvering equipment and learn about Mike's language, though such curiosity was often characterized by a marked callous detachment.[23]\n\nHe displayed the traits of a leader, giving orders and telling other people, sometimes even Titans, what to do. While he was talking with Mike, he told the Titan that was eating him to hold him instead of devouring him.[24] If his orders were not followed, he did not hesitate to use brute force. This was seen when he crushed the head of the Titan that was eating Mike as soon as it disobeyed him,[25] or when he beat Reiner to make him and Bertolt focus on acquiring the Founding Titan instead of saving Annie.[26]  His decision to prioritize the capture of the Founding Titan over rescuing Annie, and his deduction that she was not really being tortured by her captors, demonstrates an ability to think tactically and prioritize mission objectives over sentimentality.[27]\n\nZeke also seemed to be a cold, ruthless and sarcastic individual, though not explicitly sadistic. He has killed human soldiers without hesitation and let a group of Titans eat Mike when the latter had exhausted his usefulness, outwardly indifferent to the pain that he was about to endure. Instead, he mused over them speaking the same language.[28]\n\nHowever, in spite of Zeke's savage tendencies, he had been shown to take pity on the citizens living within the Walls. He had expressed that it is a \"tragedy\" that they continually sacrifice their lives trying to leave the Walls because their memories of the world have been taken away, viewing it as ultimately pointless. Zeke's condescending pity towards Paradis was strong enough to have driven him to outbursts of anger at times. To deal with these doubts, he often reminded himself during battle to not get worked up, and to find the \"enjoyment\" in life.[29]\n\nZeke's views on the Eldians' prospects in society were extremely negative and nihilistic likely as a result of his childhood and lack of attention from both of his parents, and abuses from Marleyans. As a teenager, he expressed his belief that it would have been better for the Subjects of Ymir to never have been born.[30] He planned to free the world from its fear of the Titans and the Eldians from their suffering by using the Founding Titan's abilities to sterilize all Subjects of Ymir, thus leading to their eventual extinction within 100 years.[31]\n\nZeke threatens Reiner\nZeke threatens Reiner after the latter continues to question his orders\nDuring Zeke's twenty-plus years of service as a Warrior (and later captain), he was known to be particularly efficient and ruthless. He acted highly militaristic towards the Warriors underneath him: he had no problem inflicting punishment or abandoning them if they should fail. Zeke would threaten Reiner with death if he continued his disobedience and, in the case of Bertolt, chose to simply cut his losses and left his subordinate to die in order to escape.\n\nOutside of the battlefield, Zeke displayed a drastically different demeanor characterized by a much warmer, more affable exterior and a kind of quiet charisma, acting humble around his superiors and being prone to cracking jokes. Zeke also appeared to share a friendly relationship with his fellow Warriors, though Pieck would later remark on how duplicitous and secretive he always seemed. Ultimately, Eren seems to be the only person he truly cared about, as he feels that they were both victims of their father.[32] Zeke promised to \"save\" him before, which Pieck would note as the only time she could tell that he was not lying.[33][34] Zeke's affection towards Eren had since developed into a desire to have his sentiments validated by his half-brother to the point where he was willing to postpone the sterilization of the Eldians until Eren agreed with him.[35] However, this affection for his brother appeared to have faded after learning the way that Eren manipulated their father through the Attack Titan's future memory ability, disgusted by the way Eren influenced Grisha to kill the Reiss family, and subsequently abandoned his attempt to try and get Eren to join his cause.[36]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHistory\n\nGrisha holds Zeke\nZeke was born to Grisha and Dina\nZeke Yeager was born to Grisha Yeager and Dina Fritz,[37] who were planning to overthrow the Marley government and put the Eldians back in power.[38] Grisha was among the rebels when the Marley government announced the Warrior program, asking for Eldian children between the ages of five to seven to serve as potential Warriors, with the promise that their families would be given the title of Honorary Marleyans and be ensured freedom within the country.[39] Grisha then decided to enter Zeke into the program to play the role of a spy for his cause.\n\nAt home, Zeke was routinely sent to his grandparents while both Dina and Grisha attended Eldian Restorationist meetings, with most of his visits being spent listening to his grandfather recounting stories of the Eldian race's crimes against the world.[40] Over time, his parents' preoccupation with the Eldian Restorationists led them growing continuously distant with Zeke, with Grisha in particular showing very little investment in his son's life outside of his studies and performance as a Warrior candidate.\n\nZeke training to be a Warrior\nZeke trained to be a Warrior\nInitially, Zeke did not perform impressively as a Warrior Candidate, and his trouble keeping pace with his fellow candidates caused him to be ostracized by his peers and his instructor. However, he did manage to make one friend during his training: Tom Ksaver. After a day of routine training, Zeke happened to meet Ksaver while the man was in the middle of playing catch by himself. After some prodding from Ksaver, Zeke joined him in the game, and was thrilled to hear Ksaver complimenting him on his pitching skill.[41] After returning home, Zeke tried to tell his parents about the experience, but found them in the middle of a meeting with a fellow restorationist. Zeke tried eavesdropping on the conversation, and listening in as his parents reassured Grice that he had the ability to save Eldia.\n\nZeke fails at training\nZeke disappointed his parents\nDuring another public training event, Zeke was once again outperformed by all of the other candidates. To his distress, Zeke observed that both his parents had come to watch, and was dismayed to see his father storm away from the field in frustration. That night, he cried in his room while listening to his parents argue over what to do about his poor performance.\n\nAfter the training event, Ksaver tried to cheer him up during one of their games of catch, before joking that Zeke becoming a Warrior would be a dumb idea. Surprised to hear a Warrior slandering the Warrior Program, Zeke asked to know why Ksaver had chosen to become one. Ksaver's explanation, that he had wanted the opportunity to study the Titans scientifically, surprised Zeke but he agreed with Ksaver's assertion that neither of them were meant to be soldiers.[42]\n\nWhile cleaning the halls of the Warriors' headquarters, Zeke overheard that the Marleyan Authorities were close to discovering the location of the Eldian Restorationists. Knowing that this would sentence his entire family and himself to the border of Paradis to be converted to Pure Titans,[43][44] Zeke went to his parents and begged them to stop, but was met only with their insistence that what they were doing needed to be done for the good of all Eldians. In a desperate attempt to appeal to his father, Zeke reminded him of Faye and asked if he would be okay with his own son meeting the same fate: this only managed to enrage Grisha. Terrified, Zeke tried to remind his parents that their whole family would be sent to Paradis if they were discovered, but Grisha only reiterated his previous statement that they needed to win back the rights that Marley had taken, in order to make sure that no one else met the same fate as Faye. Emotionally drained from the argument, Zeke pointed out that Faye only died because Grisha took her outside of Liberio without permission.\n\nWith no one else to turn to, Zeke revealed everything to Ksaver. Although Zeke had resigned himself to being sent to Paradis and spend an eternity as a Titan, Ksaver suggested that he turn his parents in so that only they would be punished; this would allow Zeke and his grandparents to go free. Zeke initially protested the idea but Ksaver insisted that there was no other way, reminding Zeke of all of the turmoil and strife he had experienced on account of his parents forcing their ideals on him without thought for his own feelings.[45] After some thought, Zeke agreed and turned in his parents to secure his status in Marley's eyes as a loyal Warrior. Soon after, Grisha and Dina were sent to Paradis Island to be transformed into Pure Titans. Still not knowing the truth of Zeke's heritage, Marley sent him to be raised by his grandparents.[46]\n\nDespite believing he sent his father and mother to their deaths, Zeke sympathized with their goal to free the Eldian race. Thus, Zeke continued his parents' cause by operating from the shadows to secure the Eldians' freedom from Marley in his own way. Zeke continued playing catch with Ksaver regularly during his time in the Warrior program, often using the games as a time to have long discussions with him. During one such game, Ksaver revealed that the Founding Titan had the power not only to affect the memories of Subjects of Ymir, but also to change the composition of their bodies. Inspired by this, Zeke theorized that a holder of the Founding Titan might be able to use it to render all Subjects of Ymir sterile, so that they would die out within 100 years without a need for mass genocide. Noticing Ksaver not immediately tossing back the baseball, Zeke heard Ksaver reveal that he once had a family with a Marleyan woman who had killed herself and their son after learning he was an Eldian. Listening to his mentor lament his own birth, Zeke vowed to Ksaver that he would take back the Founding Titan from Paradis, and keep it out of Marley's hands to ensure that it could not be used to hurt anyone again.[47] Soon after, Zeke was told the key in the planned euthanasia of the Eldians, the Founding Titan, must be in possession of someone who will agree to the plan and be in physical contact with a Titan descended from the royal family. Ksaver asked Zeke to find someone who is willing to go through with the plan.[48]"

I wanted people's respect! It's my fault! Your mom was eaten by a Titan because of me! I'm sick of this... of myself! Just kill me!\nREINER TO EREN\n\nReiner Braun (ライナー・ブラウン Rainā Buraun?) is the Eldian Vice Chief (副長 Fukuchō?) of the Warriors and the main protagonist of Attack on Titan from the Marleyan perspective. He is the illegitimate son of an Eldian mother and a Marleyan father who grew up in Liberio's internment zone. Eventually, he was selected as a child to become one of Marley's Warriors. From a young age, he inherited the power of the Armored Titan.\n\nIn the year 845, he infiltrated Paradis Island alongside Bertholdt Hoover, Annie Leonhart, and Marcel Galliard as part of an operation to reclaim the Founding Titan. He joined the Scout Regiment after graduating 2nd in the 104th Cadet Corps.\n\nAppearance\n\nHuman form\n\nReiner 854 appearance\nReiner's appearance in 854\nReiner has short blond hair, gold eyes, and a defined facial structure. His large height, broad shoulders, and serious expression give him an intimidating presence. As a member of the Scout Regiment, he wears the wings of freedom jacket over his standard military uniform, with a green shirt underneath. In casual attire, Reiner wears a dark gray button-down shirt with rolled up sleeves and dark green pants with a brown belt.\n\nIn the year 854, Reiner has a short goatee and has lost weight, making his cheekbones appear more defined. He has also grown taller. He is first seen wearing a military uniform in Marley. Later when they infiltrate at Shiganshina, Reiner wears another military uniform with a bulletproof vest before transforming in his Armored Titan form.\n\nAfter recovering from his coma, he is not seen wearing his military jacket to reveal his white long sleeved button-up shirt with black suspenders and a gray tank top within his white military pants and black combat boots.\n\nHe later wears a gray long sleeved shirt with the sleeves reach through his elbows along with a shoulder holster and a revamped black pants worn by the 104th Cadet Corps when he is sided with their group to stop Eren.\n\nArmored Titan form\n\nReiner's Armored Titan form was 15 meters tall and had plates of hardened skin[11] covering the entirety of its body, except for muscles in its cheeks that became exposed when it opened its lipless jaw, as well as the muscle tissue behind its knees, elbows, and feet. Its eyes were covered by white, organic lenses, and it had short, silver hair. While fighting Eren, it has been noted that it had high agility and was capable of moving at a fast momentum, despite its seemingly heavy weight and being low on stamina.\n\nPersonality\n\nAs a child, Reiner was rather quiet and meek yet at the same time very loyal and driven. Because of his motivation, Reiner was very desperate to become a Warrior, even going as far as to accuse Porco Galliard of being an Eldian spy when he belittled him. However, after he was chosen to inherit the Armored Titan, Reiner gained a newfound self-confidence, though it was quickly shattered when Marcel revealed that he was not chosen for his abilities. Due to Marley's propaganda and his mother's influence, he believed the Eldians of Paradis Island to be \"devils\" and that he would become a hero by exterminating them. He was also very gullible, never doubting the words of his mother and superiors.[12]\n\nFollowing Marcel's death, Reiner began incorporating elements from his personality into his own. He became more decisive and assertive, even willing to threaten Annie and Bertholdt to ensure they followed his orders, yet also deeply caring and genuinely desiring to protect them. He also accepted that his belief that his father would return if he were to become a Warrior and defeat the Eldians was just a fantasy. In addition to this, Reiner started to develop a negative perception towards himself, believing he was supposed to have failed in becoming a Warrior and that he should have been the one to die instead of Marcel.[12]\n\nBy the time he joined the 104th Cadet Corps, Reiner had completely incorporated Marcel's personality into his own. He built up a reputation of being a passionate and honest person with a strong sense of duty who takes his role as a soldier very seriously and encourages others to do the same. However, he was also noted to have a kind heart and a tendency to always think of others before himself, taking on extra burdens for the sake of his comrades. He was stated to be the \"big brother\" of the other cadets.[4]\n\nHowever, beneath this facade, Reiner developed serious emotional and mental problems as a result of his actions and living a double-life. While still loyal to his true cause as a Warrior of Marley, he was unable to cope with the guilt he felt towards his actions and thus began to suppress his true memories in an effort to escape. Having to kill Marco seems to have been the final straw for him, causing him to snap and develop Dissociative Identity Disorder. During these times, he forgets his true identity and truly believes himself to be a soldier of \"humanity\". Even after blowing his and Bertholdt's cover, he initially still continued to shift between his two personas. However, after Bertholdt bluntly told him that he was not a \"soldier\" but a \"warrior\", Reiner was, though with some difficulty, able to set his priorities straight.\n\nWhile similar, there appear to be a few differences between Reiner's \"soldier\" persona and his true self. His \"Warrior\" self is more ruthless and fatalistic, though out of necessity. Even so, he continually places himself at risk in an effort to reach out to others and get to see things from their perspective, as seen when he trusted Eren and Ymir more than is wise.[13]\n\nFollowing the failure of the Paradis Island Operation and fighting in the Marley Mid-East War for four years, Reiner's personality has changed so much that both his mother and cousin noted that he seems like a completely different person. Despite the fact that they are enemies now, Reiner harbors little to no malice towards his former comrades, only sarcastically referring to them as \"devils\" while humanizing their actions and beliefs before his family.[8] He also suffers from constant nightmares about his near-death experiences and frequently sees memories of his childhood. Eventually, Reiner's negative perception towards himself reached its lowest point and caused him to contemplate committing suicide. However, despite stating that he wants to die, he cannot bring himself to, as his dedication toward his loved ones still exceeds his self-loathing.[12]\n\nHowever, in spite of all his emotional issues, Reiner is very intelligent with notable leadership qualities, able to think clearly, analyze situations, and formulate effective plans. As Eren himself confirmed, he is able to think ahead and in the long term, able to accurately predict the consequences depending on the course of action taken, all while maintaining his composure.[14] He understood the hidden meaning behind Zeke Jaeger's words when he indirectly implied that the Warriors' meeting was being bugged by their Marleyan superiors, and acted accordingly, quickly agreeing to his Captain's plan and intentionally cutting off Galliard before he could run his mouth too much. During their mission on Paradis Island, while it was Annie's job to gather the information, it was mostly Reiner who strategized, coming up with efficient multi-step plans not long after acquiring intel from her. As a leader, Reiner is also very devoted to his mission, to the point that he refused to talk and was ready to die when he was the Scout Regiment's prisoner and Hange Zoë threatened to kill him for not cooperating.[15]\nHistory\n\nReiner during Warrior training\nReiner during Warrior training\nReiner was born in the Liberio Internment Zone in Marley, to an Eldian mother, Karina Braun and a Marleyan father. Growing up, he was not allowed to see his father, as communication between the two ethnic groups were strictly forbidden. As a child, it was decided between him and his mother that he would become a Warrior candidate and potentially inherit one of the Nine Titans so that Reiner and his mother could become honorary Marleyans and reunite with Reiner's father.\n\nAfter joining the Warrior program Reiner and his fellow candidates learned from Zeke Jaeger that in a few years an operation to reclaim the Founding Titan would begin, and six new Warrior candidates would be chosen to inherit the power of the Titans. He was mocked by fellow candidate Porco Galliard for believing he would inherit a Titan, who claimed that Reiner would have to wait thirteen more years to inherit the Armored Titan.\n\nReiner quarrels with Porco\nReiner quarreled with Porco\nThis led to a fight that ended when Marcel pulled his brother back and the others left with Zeke. Bertholdt Hoover attempted to convince Reiner to give up his aspirations, but Reiner believed that even if he died young from the Curse of Ymir he would be remembered as a hero to the people of Marley and be the best son in the world.\n\nMarcel ultimately influenced the army, leading to Reiner being selected to inherit the Armored Titan in place of his brother Porco. Alongside the other Warriors, the six Titans crushed an entire nation, leading to them being regarded as a stronger group than their predecessors.\n\nReiner's father yells at him\nReiner met his father\nIn 845 at age twelve, Reiner, Bertholdt, Annie, and Marcel were tasked with retaking the Founding Titan in Paradis Island. Before they left Reiner found and confronted his father alone in a kitchen where the man worked. Reiner told his father he knew who he was and that because he and his mother were honorary Marleyans now they could all live together. Before he could finish his father cut him off, calling them Eldian devils and saying that his family would be done for if the truth about Reiner's parentage came out. To stop that, Reiner's father chose to run away.\n\nUpon traveling to the island, the Warriors parted ways with the army at the border and began traveling by horseback under the cover of night. While resting, Reiner learned of Marcel being the reason he was chosen to inherit the Armored Titan.[12]\n\nYmir devours Reiner and Bertholdt's friend\nReiner and Bertholdt fled from the Titan that devoured Marcel\nAs the sun began to rise, Marcel pushed Reiner out of the way of a Titan emerging from the ground, leading to the Warriors fleeing while Marcel was eaten.[16]\n\nAfter the loss of Marcel, Annie and Bertholdt wanted to cancel the operation but Reiner opted against it as he claimed to know the consequences. This prompted Annie to attack him for his cowardice. After getting beaten up, Reiner tackled her and declared his resolve to become the leader as Bertholdt agreed to continue the operation.[12]\nStory\n\nThe Fall of Shiganshina arc\n\nAn armored Titan destroys the gate\nReiner destroys Wall Maria\nShortly after the Colossal Titan first breaches Wall Maria via Shiganshina District, Reiner assumes his Armored Titan form and enters the city and makes his way across it to the interior gate of Wall Maria. Once there, he charges towards the gate as several Garrison members try to stop him with cannon fire. However the cannons have no effect and Reiner quickly smashes through the wall, allowing the other Titans to swarm Wall Maria.[17] Following this, Reiner, Bertholdt and Annie mix in with the survivors and flee to Wall Rose with them. The three pass themselves off as survivors of a small hunting village on the south side of Wall Maria to cover for their lack of family records which the destruction of Wall Maria, and the loss of vital documents during the chaos, helped contribute to.[4]\n\nShortly after the destruction of Wall Maria, Reiner and Bertholdt were among the many refugees that were informed of the food shortage.[17]\n\nAfter the attack, Reiner and his allies enter a refugee camp inside Wall Rose. While with the refugees, the three meet a man from a small village in the southeast of Wall Maria that was destroyed by the Titans. The man is later found having apparently killed himself, and the three decide to co-opt his story as their own.[12]\n\nHumanity's Comeback arc\n\nReiner and Bertholdt\nReiner and Bertholdt after enlisting\nTwo years after the destruction of Wall Maria, Reiner enlists in the military and becomes a member of the 104th Training Corps. On the first day of training, Reiner is one of the few students who the instructor Keith Sadies does not attempt to haze, as he is able to tell that Reiner has already been through a rite of passage. At a later stage, Keith does ask Reiner what he joined the military for and Reiner answers that he wants \"to save humanity.\"[18]\n\nAfter failing repeatedly to operate the omni-directional mobility gear, Eren seeks advice from his fellow cadets and is sent to Reiner and Bertholdt for help by Marco Bodt. Though initially unfriendly towards Eren and Armin, Reiner and Bertholdt quickly warm up to them after learning they are from Shiganshina District and are still willing to enlist in the Scout Regiment. Reiner is especially impressed with Eren's will to enlist despite watching his mother being devoured by a Titan. He shares his desire to return to his lost hometown and agrees to give Eren advice. The next day they witness Eren's last attempt to pass where he fails yet again until Sadies notices that his equipment is defective. Upon being resupplied, Eren passes the test as Reiner and Bertholdt watch impressed with Eren's determination.[18]\n\nOver the next three years, Reiner continued his training with his fellow cadets. Reiner was noted by Keith Sadies to have exceptional mental and physical fortitude, as well as a great ability to gain the confidence of his comrades. Eren also came to view him as a big brother to the 104th and came to idolize Reiner and aspired to be as strong as him one day.[19] However, the guilt of all the people who died because of him caused Reiner to develop physiological trauma and he developed dissociative identity disorder, developing an alter-ego that believed he really was a soldier and not a Warrior. Sometimes, Reiner would not be able to remember who he really was until Bertholdt reminded him which saddened his friend.[13]\n\nAt some point during their training, the cadets completed a snowstorm training exercise. However, Reiner quickly notes that Christa, Ymir, and Daz are still missing. Marco suggests they are with Thomas' squad but Reiner points out that his squad just completed their mission. The next morning when Eren, Mikasa, and Armin decide to go looking for them, Reiner and Bertholdt decide to accompany them, as well as Conny, Sasha, and Marco. However, they hear a loud almost thunder-like noise and head out to investigate but discover Ymir returning to camp with Daz who is tended to by the others indoors.[20]\n\nNearly five years into their mission Reiner, Annie, and Bertholdt have a meeting. Annie reports to Reiner that Kenny Ackermann surprised her while she was spying and that she narrowly avoided capture. Kenny might have seen her face so that if she joins the Interior Military Police Brigade she could be compromised. When Annie once more expresses her wish to return to Marley, Reiner again disagrees with her and decides to destroy Wall Rose to flush out the Founding Titan. Annie notes his plan will kill a lot of his new friends from the 104th Cadet Corps, but Reiner insists the other trainees are not their friends.\n\nSome time after that night, Reiner sees Eren take a bad fall while training with his ODM gear. He tells Eren to take a break, but Eren is afraid to do so. Eren does not want to die without having accomplished anything and asks what he can do to be like Reiner. Reiner tells him to simply do what he needs to and keep moving forward. He says that he is certain Eren will exterminate all the Titans."

I'm fully aware that I've commited irredeemable sins. But. If it's for returning to my father...I won't hesitate to repeat what I did.\nANNIE EXPRESSES HER CONVICTION\n\nAnnie Leonhart (アニ・レオンハート Ani Reonhāto?) is a graduate of the 104th Cadet Corps and former member of the Military Police Regiment. Her exceptional skill with swords and unarmed combat earned her the 4th rank, but she is noted to be a lone wolf that struggles to work with others.[4]\n\nShe possessed the ability to transform into a Titan known as the Female Titan. She trained from an early age by her father,[4] and is selected as one of Marley's Warriors. In the year 845, she is sent on a mission to retrieve the Founding Titan, along with her fellow Warriors Reiner Braun, Bertholdt Hoover, and Marcel Galliard. As the Female Titan, she served as a major antagonist prior to being exposed and defeated by the Scout Regiment. After her defeat, she crystallized herself and was left in a comatose state. She was held underground for approximately four years before escaping during a battle between the Military, the Jaegerists, and the forces of Marley.[8]\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\nHonest Trailers Commentary | Fast X\n\nUnmute\n\nAdvanced Settings\n\nFullscreen\n\nPlay\n\nRewind 10 Seconds\n\nUp Next\nBrand logo\n\n\nHuman form\n\nAnnie is a teenage girl of considerably short height with a small, yet very muscular build and physique. She has moderately short hair that is often tied at the back with her right fringe mainly draping over the right side of her face (though she tends to push it to the side on occasion; possibly for better visibility). She has an oval-shaped face, blonde hair, blue eyes, a\n\nRoman nose\n, and pale complexion. Her hair color is noticeably paler than most other blonde-haired characters and when untied, her hair reaches down the nape of her neck. Her eyes, although of considerable size and proportion, often have a sullen vibe to their appearance. Annie's casual attire mainly consists of a hooded sweatshirt underneath a jacket accompanied by dark gray pants. She is often seen in the Cadet Corps uniform and then the Military Police Regiment uniform after graduation. Though Annie often wears hooded sweatshirts as part of her standard attire, she also wears her signature white hooded sweatshirt as part of her standard military attire. During her missions as the Female Titan, it is implied that she always wears her ring which has a small, folding blade on her right index finger; using it as her primary source of causing self-injury in order to transform into her Female Titan form at any time.\n\nFour years later after being freed from her crystalized stasis, Annie no longer keeps her hair up and lets it hang loose. She still wears her Military Police uniform and gains a brown cloak. Later, she maintains her white hooded sweatshirt with a shoulder holster and a revamped black pants worn by the 104th Cadet Corps when she sided with the others to stop Eren.\n\nFemale Titan form\n\nAnnie's appearance as the Female Titan changed quite drastically, though her overall physique and facial features remained mostly the same. Her body consisted mainly of exposed muscle tissue, in which there was a noticeably limited amount of skin coverage across her body, and fingers made out of bone. Along with a massive increase in height, her face was laden with muscle lining, notably underneath her cheeks, giving her the capability to stretch her mouth far more than it seemed possible, along with yellowish teeth. Compared to the majority of other Titans encountered, Annie's Titan form seemed much more physically fit and stronger, bearing a lean build with visible muscle definition and a feminine form.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nPersonality\n\nAnnie is considered to be an isolated, exclusionary type; friendships do not come to her easily. She is rarely seen smiling and often has an emotionless expression. She is apathetic and somnolent, with little desire to put in any effort into meaningless disciplines or activities, and instead focuses exclusively on making it into the Military Police Regiment to obtain an easy life.[9] Yet, she somehow does seem to hold a strange fascination and even feelings of respect towards people that have a deep sense of duty and righteousness - in those people who do care and who can devote their lives and even die for causes they believe in.\n\nAnnie's sense of humor tends to be mocking, sarcastic, deadpan, and surprising. It also sometimes expresses a partial truth, and it happens mostly in intense situations. For example, when she was cornered by the Scouts in front of an underground passage.\n\nDespite Annie's usual cold and calm demeanor, she has been shown to emote her feelings in various ways. At the times she does lose her composure, she usually reacts with violence. She beats up Reiner Braun for his cowardice after Marcel was eaten and for trying to manipulate her to continue a mission that had, in her view, already failed.[10] She was clearly angered when Reiner teased her about her constant avoidance in hand-to-hand combat training.[4] Despite her seeming callousness, she has expressed a level of guilt and shock, most notably when apologizing to a certain corpse after the battle of Trost District.[11] Annie is also known to be very dedicated in her mission as a Warrior, to the point that she had killed many innocent people to reach her goal (also attempting to kill many of her former comrades), and shed tears when she failed to capture Eren.[12] However, she is not entirely remorseless; while she carried out her duty of disposing of her former comrade Marco, she did so with great distress and shed anguished tears at the sight of him being eaten. This incident would haunt her for some time afterwards. Though she is seemingly indifferent towards her capability as a competent hand-to-hand combat fighter, she remains proud of her skills and even appears to enjoy the very notion of fighting as deduced by Eren.[13]\n\nAnnie is highly intelligent, able to think deeply about situations, and has shown considerable problem-solving ability and a quick wit. These personality traits, in conjunction with her calm attitude and analytical skills, make her a good tactician. While undercover as a refugee, and later as a trainee, she does most of the spy work for the Warriors. Annie also realizes the contradictions of the military training system within the Walls and is not fooled by the Marleyan propaganda. However, she is a bad liar, being called out on this by both Eren and Kenny, the former regarding her apathy towards her martial arts prowess, and the latter when she lies about being his daughter, even sarcastically insisting further. On the other hand, she is very good at spotting the lies of other people, seen when she realizes Armin Arlelt's dishonesty far before they had even reached the underground tunnel, as well as Reiner's lie about befriending their fellow cadets as being nothing more than a pragmatic attempt to gain their trust.[14][10]\n\nShe is extremely practical and self-aware, being honest about her strengths and weaknesses, and is rarely ever prone to self-deception or emotional mistakes. Furthermore, she had a casual acceptance of her negative personality traits, freely admitting her faults even to almost-complete strangers such as Marlo Freudenberg, calling herself worthless and evil with no hint of self-loathing. She is nevertheless capable of self-loathing, as seen when she claimed to be as selfish as the Marleyan government.[10]\n\nNonetheless, what drives Annie more than anything is her desire for a normal life. Though she has no love for Marley itself, the only reason she is so concentrated on her mission is that it because it would allow her to go back home to her father, and she had urged Reiner several times before her eventual capture to return to Marley with the information they had gathered so far; despite her otherwise cynical and realist worldview, Annie managed to convince herself of the false notion that it would be enough to avoid punishment.[10] When she lost Eren due to the actions of both Mikasa and Levi in the Titan Forest, Annie saw the easiest chance to return to her father was gone and she began visibly crying in her Titan form.[12]\n\nAfter escaping her confinement, Annie undergoes a significant change in character, becoming more open about working with her former friends to stop the actions of Eren and the Jaegerists. She also freely acknowledges to Hitch that she has committed unforgivable acts, something Annie normally would have kept to herself. Later, as the Wall Titans trample through Marley, she admits to Armin that she genuinely appreciated him visiting her for the past four years she was enclosed inside her crystal. Annie also tells him she sees herself as a monster.[15]\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nHistory\n\nAnnie as a infant\nAnnie sometime after her birth\nAfter Annie's birth, her blood test revealed she was a Subject of Ymir, which suggested her mother had an affair with an Eldian man. While it is unknown what happened to her mother, Annie was deported to the internment zone and later adopted by Leonhart who was relocated for similar reasons. Her adoptive father intended to train her to become a Warrior so that he could live a privileged life. Thus, from a young age, Annie underwent rigorous combat training with Leonhart.[3]\n\nAnnie would eventually become as strong as he wanted; but in retaliation for all she had endured, she attacked him and left him permanently crippled. The brutal training she endured left her callous towards others, unable to find any value in whether one lived or died.[3]\n\nAnnie beats her father\nAnnie cripples her father\nIn her early childhood, Annie was relentlessly subjected to combat training in her hometown by her father, who reminded her often of the mission she was born to carry out.[16][14] At one point during Annie's training, her father pushed her too far during a training session, causing her to snap and attack him, savagely beating him while he was down to where she crippled him.[17][3] At some point, Annie was chosen by the Marleyan government to inherit the power of the Female Titan.\n\nAlongside the rest of her Warrior comrades, the six Titans in Marley's command used their powers to crush Mid East Forces, testing their abilities in the process. The six Warriors proved themselves to be more effective weapons than their predecessors, largely alleviating Marley's concerns about entrusting the upcoming Paradis Island Operation to children.[10]\n\nYoung Annie and her father\nAnnie's father apologized and made her promise to return home\nIn the year 845, Annie set out on a mission to exterminate humanity within the Walls and retrieve the Founding Titan, along with her childhood friends, Reiner Braun, Bertholdt Hoover and Marcel Galliard, the wielders of the Armored Titan, Colossal Titan, and Jaw Titan. Before her departure, her father apologized for his actions and asked for her to return home alive, assuring her that her father would always be on her side.[13]\n\nOn their journey, the four young Warriors were ambushed by a Titan slumbering in the earth that tried to devour Reiner. As he stood in fear, Reiner was almost killed until Marcel pushed him away but was grabbed and devoured instead while Reiner, Bertholdt, and Annie watched in horror.[18]\n\nAnnie beats up Reiner\nAnnie beat up Reiner\nAfter escaping from the Titan, Annie is able to find Reiner and angrily attacks him for his cowardice. She argues that they should retrieve the Jaw Titan's new wielder and return to Marley, but Reiner attempts to manipulate her into continuing the mission. Annie continues to beat him, saying that she never bought into Marley's brainwashing propaganda. Reiner manages to win the scuffle and forces Annie and Bertholdt to continue the mission, telling them that Marley would kill them if they flee now and that this was the only way they could ever go home"

Hange follows it deep into the forest and it stops within a field. After a brief delay, it begins banging its head on a tree within the center of the field. Hange and company get off their horses and tries to ask it what is its purpose is but is interrupted when it swings at them. After using their omni-directional mobility gear to escape to a tree, they again come down to the ground and try to talk to it before Oruo attempts to kill it. When Hange pleas him to stop he becomes distracted and is captured and almost eaten before Levi appears and cuts off its arm and then kills it.

It then addresses her, saying \"Ymir's people\" and \"Ymir-sama,\" greeting her with deep respect, and bows. She is thoroughly confused that the Titan can form speech, and writes in her diary that she has attempted communication. She first questions it about what the Titans are, and building up blind sadness, fear and rage, she angrily yells why Titans eat humans and what their objective is. The Titan appears more and more frustrated as it moans and tears at its cheeks, ripping off flesh and spraying blood. Ilse attempts to flee but is caught by the Titan, who is rapidly crushing her skull, and Ilse writes down her last few notes about the experience before being decapitated, while the Titan seemingly cries.

He was noted for always wearing thick-rimmed glasses with bands around his head, to prevent them from falling off in combat. His clothing consisted of the typical uniform of the Scout Regiment with the green cloak worn on expeditions.\nPersonality\n\nAbel was a serious man and a devoted Scout Regiment member, always acting bravely in battle and following his duties as a soldier. He seemed to be a loyal and reliable subordinate, since he was trusted to accompany high ranking members in critical situations.\nStory\n\nThe 57th Exterior Scouting Mission arc\n\nGoggles and his comrades begin to intercept the Titans\nAbel intercepts the Titans that are after the Female Titan\nDuring the 57th Exterior Scouting Mission, Abel serves as part of the cart guard team, transporting the special target restraining weapon.\n\nAfter the Female Titan is captured, it attracts several Titans with a loud screech. Erwin Smith orders the supplies guard unit to intercept the Titans, with Abel and several other soldiers trying to distract them. However, they are ignored by the wave of Titans as they go to eat the Female Titan.

He attempts to follow her as she flees the district, but is forced to end his pursuit when she enters an open area where he cannot use his ODM gear.[4]\n\nClash of the Titans arc\n\nAbel helps cover the Titan inside of Wall Sina, after Eren and Annie's battle exposes it. He then watches with the rest of his squad as Hange Zoë threatens Nick for answers.[5]\n\nGoggles listens to Hange's suspicions\nAbel listens to Hange's suspicions about Reiner and Bertholdt\nWhen Titans are reported to have invaded Wall Rose, Abel is among the Scout Regiment soldiers that Erwin Smith leads from Stohess District to the front lines.[6] They stop in Ehrmich District where Hange goes over a report about Annie Leonhart's background with a number of Scouts, including Abel.[7]\n\nAbel is among the soldiers that accompany Hange Zoë to rescue the 104th cadets trapped at Utgard Castle.[8] Afterward, Abel returns with the rest of the Scouts to Wall Rose to recover. When Hannes' Garrison squad arrives to report that there is no breach in the Wall, Hange calls for the Scouts to fall back to Trost. However, they are stopped by the sudden appearance of the Colossal and Armored Titans.[7]\n\nGoggles attacking the Colossal Titan\nAbel prepares to attack the Colossal Titan\nAbel and the other Scouts jump off the Wall to avoid the Colossal Titan's attack and Hange orders their soldiers to swarm it. They use their omni-directional mobility gear to swing around the Colossal Titan and as they dodge around its fist, Abel notes that though the Titan is big, that is all that it has going for it. However, before they can reach its nape, the Colossal Titan emits a scalding burst of steam that drives all of them back.[2]\n\nHange leaves three of the four squads with them to watch Bertholdt and takes the remaining squad, including Abel, to face the Armored Titan, which is fighting Eren in his Titan form. During the battle Abel sees Mikasa and Armin attempt to help Eren and orders them to stay back, as getting close would be dangerous. They follow him back to the Wall, and so does Eren.[2]\n\nKeiji and Goggles chase the Armored Titan\nAbel and Keiji follow the fight between Eren and the Armored Titan\nReiner charges after him, and when they next engage, Eren gains the upper hand. The Armored Titan roars in desperation and Abel quickly searches the area to see if it has attracted more Titans, before reporting to Hange that there are none.[2]\n\nRoyal Government arc\n\nAbel is present when Hange delivers news to the squads that Pastor Nick has been murdered. After Levi receives news that a freeze has been instated on all Scout activity and warrants have been issued for Eren and Historia's arrest, Abel is placed under Levi's command to help his squad smuggle Eren and Historia into Trost for safe harbor with Commander Pyxis.\n\nAbel's death\nAbel is shot in the head\nEntering Trost, Abel and Nifa keep watch over Keiji, Eren, and Historia as they proceed to the Garrison's headquarters.

This implies that he was among the few Scout Regiment members who knew about the true objective of the expedition, meaning that he had managed to stay alive for at least the past five years and that he was a trusted member of the Scouts."

It is where the user can select the transformation they want to become; initiate the process of transforming; and stay in said transformation. The actual usage time is 15 minutes at a time. However, different factors and actions performed by the user can severely diminish the available usage time: most commonly if the user, while transformed, changes to another form. If the user slamming the core, this affects the time limit of a transformation, as the user could stay transformed for hours.\n\nRecharge Mode\nWhen the Omnitrix's usage time is fully depleted (i.e. \"times out\"), it goes into Recharge Mode: firstly warning of the timing out; then detransforming the user and locking all functions of Active Mode while the Omnitrix recharges.\n\nTime Out\nThe Omnitrix is capable of detecting when it's host is in any sort of life-threatening distress. Specifically, it can instantly recharge to protect the user from a direct physical threat.\n\nIf the user is knocked out or hurt enough, the Omnitrix will revert them to their normal form.\n\nCollect Mode\nWhen a new DNA sample has been unlocked, or when the Omnitrix captures new DNA not present in the catalog, Collect Mode is activated. However, if the Omnitrix is far away from the detected sample, the Omnitrix's other functions will be disabled until the alien is scanned.\n\nThe Omnitrix symbol shooting green ray\nWhen in alien form, the Omnitrix shoots out a green ray from the dial.\n\nWhen the Omnitrix scans the DNA of an alien it doesn't have, it won't always be immediately unlocked in the arsenal.\n\nSelf-Destruct\nThe Omnitrix has a self-destruction mode. In this mode, the Omnitrix will begin a countdown, beeping as a warning that the mode has been activated. It can be enabled if settings are changed, and can be disabled if settings are changed again.\n\nRandomizer\nThe Omnitrix has a randomizer function that works in one of two ways: either the user will continuously change between different aliens every few minutes before timing out, or they will turn into one random alien for an inconsistently short period of time before changing back.\n\nMalfunctions\nIf the Omnitrix does mis-transform, it is because of the user slamming on the Omnitrix's core too hard and (inadvertently) the scroll pad.\nMuch like the Ultimatrix, the Omnitrix is not hack proof.\nMuch like the original Omnitrix, the Omnitrix does not have a failsafe against magic. If the Omnitrix symbol is bitten by magic creatures, such as rock monsters, the device will send a shockwave, distransform the user and will select only one alien.\nLike the original Omnitrix, on occasion any damage the user sustains was retained when said user times out.\nThe DNA Scanner of the Omnitrix will attempt to scan any new DNA in the vicinity. If the DNA sample is too far away, then the Omnitrix will shut down all its other functions until it scans the new sample.\nThe user can be prevented from transforming by the Forever Knights DNA Scanner which would scan the transformations DNA before reveting the user.\nToo many transformations and reversals will wear out the Omnitrix, causing it to go into a cooldown cycle.\nThe Omnitrix has no mind control protection.\nThe Omnitrix may stop working when frozen in time by a Chronosapien.\nIn addition to gaining all the powers and abilities of an alien, the user gains all the weaknesses of that alien as well. One common weakness includes being vulnerable to the alien's natural predator. The user is also susceptible to certain behaviors inherent to the alien he/she is transformed into, such as Swampfire's evolution, and the Swarm Gastronomy of Upchuck.\nUpon activating the Randomizer Function, the user will constantly switch transformations at the most inopportune times, thereby putting them into potentially dangerous situations.\nWhen exposed to electromagnetic interference from beings like Phil, it can make the Omnitrix transform the user into electrical aliens even when they select a different alien.\nThe genetics of some species can alter the user's personality, as occurs with Rath.\nIf tampered with by Eon, the Omnitrix can transfer the user's mind in cross-time to a younger version."

Due to the denouncement of his son and the kingdom's prince, Head Icon Dark Choco Cookie, Dark Cacao Cookie remains the sole member of the kingdom's royal family.\n\nThis kingdom's culture is strongly based on Joseon-era (Korean: 조선) Korea, whilst the environment is perhaps based on Tibet, located in the frigid Himalayas.\n\nThe Dark Cacao Kingdom is the focus of the Snow on the Black Wall and Citadel of the Frozen Cliff World Exploration: Crispia Episodes, and its Decoration Theme is the Kingdom of the Unwavering.\n\n~\n\nThe Dark Cacao Kingdom is located on the continent of Crispia in the Cookie Kingdom. It sits on the easternmost segment of the continent with the Jellyfish Ocean bordering it to the right and the Licorice Sea with an unlabeled offshoot river to the northeast. It is sheltered to the southwest by the frigid Giant Icing Ridge. Some adjacent landmarks are the Wish Tree, the Cream Cake Mountains, the Milkyway Lake, and what appears to be the Tower of Sweet Chaos. The nearest other kingdom is the Hollyberry Kingdom to the south-southeast.\n\nWhile the Licorice Sea is labeled only in gibberish text in the final Cookie Kingdom map, the draft map reveals its true name."

A traveler risks to lose their track quickly in this snow-covered land unless they carefully mark the road. If it did happen, all there is left is to pray Fortuna that a sugar mouse left its chocoball fruit stash somewhere nearby...\n\nPredatory Animals:\nPredators like the Cacao Eagle or the Dire Creamwolf hunt their prey in the Dark Cacao Kingdom’s wilderness. While most of the animals native to this land have a white coat to camouflage into the snowy environment, there are also dark-coated beasts. Be extremely careful if you spot one of them: the dark fur signifies that they are not afraid of their natural enemies.\n\nGeography & Environment:\nThe snow never stops falling high up in the mountains of the Giant Icing Ridge on the eastmost edge of Crispia. The Black Citadel towers above the edge of a cliff, watching over endless birch forests. Dire beasts of all kinds stalk this frigid wilderness, but they are harmless compared to the terrors of the Licorice Sea across the ridge. These creatures pose a constant threat to the Kingdom, but fortunately, it has been kept safe by the Great Chocolate Wall until now."

          "content": "Architecture:\nThe Dark Cacao Kingdom’s architecture is distinguished by its roof-supporting cylindrical columns topped with massive chocolate capitals. For wind protection, walls are often covered with chocolate panels with several layers of thick cream between them. Dark Cacao architects often address the motif of life and death by or interweaving black and white elements. Altars and shrines fashioned out of chocolate to commemorate the fallen can be found throughout the Kingdom.\n\nThe architecture of the Dark Cacao Kingdom strongly resembles that of Korea's Goryeo (Korean: 고려) (918-1392) and Joseon (Korean: 조선) (1392-1910) dynasties, leaning more towards the Joseon style of architecture.\n\nDuring the Goryeo period, Buddhism was at its most influential in Korea's history, and the importance of religion strongly affected the period's architecture. Numerous temples and pagodas were constructed to accommodate religious needs, with the vast majority of pagodas being made from stone due to the nation's abundance of granite.\n\nThe Joseon dynasty followed directly after the Goryeo dynasty and thus still had the previous period's architecture, though the change of those in influential positions caused the architectural style to change accordingly. Those in power stressed an importance of practicality and frugality similar to the Dark Cacao Kingdom's own sense of values.\n\nThe Black Citadel's design strikingly resembles Geunjeongjeon (Korean: 근정전), the throne hall in Gyeongbokgung (Korean: 경복궁). Both exteriors of the buildings are adorned with numerous sculptures of real and mythical creatures.\n\nCulture:\nHarsh climate doesn’t make for a developed sense of humor. What the Dark Cacao Cookies genuinely excel at is combat. From a young age they learn weapons or martial arts. When the time comes, an apprentice finally receives a sword to defeat a wolf on their own and complete the coming of age ritual, and although the Cookie was allowed sweet cocoa or delicate milk chocolate, it is only bitter food from this point on. The Dark Cacao consider bitter food a constant reminder of perils and death. As a result the Cookies are not afraid of crumbling, but rather despise dishonorable living.\n\nThe Kingdom of the Unwavering decoration theme is based on the Dark Cacao Kingdom and contains decorations described as simple, elegant, and modest. The description for the Royal Feast Table states that the kingdom's denizens value modesty above all and vastly prefer neat, simple looking things as opposed to fancy embellishments.\n\nThis Dark Cacao decor may be based off a Korean cultural ceremony known as Jesa (Korean: 제사), or ancestral rites. Jesa is a ceremony where Koreans act as if they are talking to their passed ancestors as they put food on the ceremony's table. Jesa is also usually celebrated at an anniversary of the ancestor's death, during which the dearly departed's favorite foods and drinks would be offered on the table.\n\nIn Citadel of the Frozen Cliff, the painting of The Sun, the Moon, and Five Peaks seems to be based on the real-life painting of the same name, or Irworobongdo (Korean: 일월오봉도). The painting is also set right behind the Phoenix Throne in Gyeongbokgung (Korean: 경복궁), upon which the Citadel is likely based.\n\nPhilosophy:\nThe Dark Cacao Kingdom largely adheres to the beliefs of Confucianism, aligning with the historical prevalence of Neo-Confucianism Joseon-era Korea. While distinct from one another, the traditions of the Dark Cacao Kingdom largely exist within the overlap between the two philosophies, making it difficult to place a definitive label. However, with the addition of Head Icon Mystic Flour Cookie, it can be assumed that the Dark Cacao Kingdom is retroactively intended to lean towards Neo-Confucianism; it is said to have emerged in direct response to the prevalence of Buddhism throughout east Asia. This concept of new ideals emerging from the groundwork of previous beliefs is particularly apt in the case of Head Icon Mystic Flour Cookie and Head Icon Dark Cacao Cookie, who are each respectively rooted in Chinese and Korean cultures that have experienced a similar relationship throughout history.\n\nConfucianism is at its core a rational and humanistic philosophy. It places great emphasis on an individual's actions with the end goal of social harmony, setting it apart from other philosophies and religions of its time by its relatively grounded, narrow lens. Rather than dictating tradition through the wishes of a higher power, such as the Buddhist beliefs of karma or nirvana, Confucianism believes that one should live a righteous life for the sake of themselves, their family, and those around them - hence the term \"humanistic\". This mindset appears to find itself within each citizen of the Dark Cacao Kingdom - even more so amongst Head Icon government and Head Icon military officials - who find their strength in banding together as a collective against the harsh and at times, dangerous environment the kingdom is situated in. In particular, citizens of the Milk Tribe are known for being \"stalwart and strong\", believing that Cookies should always help other Cookies, even towards strangers and especially in times of strife.\n\nThere is a deep loyalty and reliance upon the crown and its delegates, with even the lowest of citizens able to make direct requests to their king with the expectation of response. Such rapport, rarely seen within a monarchical structure, speaks great volumes to the humble collectivism fostered within the kingdom, circling back to the Confucianist ideal of harmony. The Dark Cacao Kingdom additionally goes out of its way to honor those who have gone above and beyond in this pursuit, particularly by giving their lives. They continue to be highly respected long after they are no more than spirits, never forgetting the sacrifices made in order to protect their land. Such an honorable fate is idealized to the point where even Head Icon Dark Cacao Cookie, the kingdom's reigning sovereign, aspires to one day be laid to rest amongst them. To a lesser extreme, all members of the Black Citadel appear unwaveringly loyal to their kingdom even if they are not combatants.\n\n-History:\nFounding:\nDark Cacao Kingdom was founded by Head Icon Dark Cacao Cookie on the edge of the Giant Icing Ridge, in the very place where with a single stroke, he had put an end to the many day-long battle between the White Dragon of the South and the Black Dragon of the North."

The Dark Cacao generally consist of physically fit, resilient Cookies with deep brown dough, black or brown hair with light streaks and various textures, and scars or other dough imperfections. The majority of the populace are chocolate-based, though races based on coffee, licorice, and milk are also prevalent in their society.\n\nThe Dark Cacao are often disciplined and humorless in demeanor due to their harsh environment and strict traditions, though lighter personalities exist despite the stringency of their world. They hold great pride in their way of life but remain modest in all other respects.\n\n-Known Denizens:\nCurrent Residents:\nDark Cacao Cookie, Caramel Arrow Cookie (The First Watcher), Crunchy Chip Cookie, The Second Watcher and many warriors and citizens.\n\nCookies of Dark Cacao Ancestry:\nMilk Cookie, Licorice Cookie, Espresso Cookie, Chess Choco Cookies.\n\nBanished, Ex-residents:\nDark Choco Cookie, Affogato Cookie.\n\nSwordsmen:\n검사 : 다크카카오 왕국의 대표적인 직업. 밤이 되면 중무장한 채 마을 주변을 순찰는 다크카카오 전사들을 심심치 않게 만날 수 있다.\n\nSwordsmen: A quintessential occupation of the Dark Cacao Kingdom.

They carry large chocolate medicine bags filled with various remedies. Without their dedication, the Cookies of the Dark Cacao Kingdom would catch a cold every day.\n\nDark Cacao pharmaceutical practices are near-identical to traditional Korean medicine. Its practitioners are modeled after uinyeo (Korean: 의녀)—though these Cookie uinyeo seem to neither be nor treat exclusively women[1] like real-life Joseon uinyeo—and treat citizens with identifiable methods like yakchim (Korean: 약침). The traveling, backpacked pharmacists of early concept art, whose real-life inspirations are unclear, appear to have been replaced by the uinyeo Cookies.\n\nTamers (including Crunchy Chip Cookie):\n조련사 : 야생동물을 길들여 파트너로 함께 싸우는 전사, 보통 카카오매나 크림늑대와 파트너일때가 많지만 종종 특이한 생물과 함께 다니는 쿠키도 보인다.\n\nTamers: Warriors who tame wild animals to fight alongside them as partners. These Cookies usually partner with Cacao Hawks or Cream Wolves, though some can be seen alongside more unusual creatures.\n\nThese wildlife tamer Cookies are seen chiefly in Head Icon Crunchy Chip Cookie and his Cream Wolves squadron, with the latter likely consisting of even more unseen Tamer Cookies.\n\nDisc Sledders:\n원반썰매꾼 : 온통 눈밭인 다크카카오 킹덤 주변을 빠르게 돌아다니고 싶다면 이들의 도움은 필수이다. 그들은 마법기계를 조종할 수 있는 외지인 마법사로 구성되어 있다.\n\nDisc Sledders: Their help is essential for quick travel across the snow-covered Dark Cacao Kingdom. They are made up of foreign sorcerers who can control magic machines.\n\nThe Disc Sledders appear to be absent altogether from the final version of the Dark Cacao Kingdom. Their real-life cultural inspiration, if any, is unknown.\n\n-Tribes & Villages:\nThe following are tribes and villages whose lands fall within this kingdom's borders.\n\nCoffee Tribe/Village:\nCookies of the Coffee Tribe live beside the Dark Cocoa Kingdom(sic) in their tent settlement. They are quick and agile and are known to last without sleep for several nights. These traits allow them to work as scouts, infiltrators, and messengers for the Kingdom. Due to the high caffeine content, their pupils are always constricted.\n\n-Affogato Cookie\n-Espresso Cookie (ancestral)\n\nMilk Tribe/Village:\nBefore the Great Chocolate Wall, the Dark Cacao Kingdom was open to invasions from the Licorice Sea. The Milk Village north of the Black Citadel was on the brink of extinction until the Dark Cacao warriors put an end to the monsters' attacks. The tribe survived, and its Cookies swore their friendship to the Kingdom.

          "content": "Outhrinia is a Germanic nation with territory spanning from eastern France to Poland, with borders on the Italian Alps, the English Channel, and the Mediterranean sea. It is a heavily militarized nation with some form of military service being mandatory with no exceptions, even for the former nobility, although such rules have been relaxed since the Second Great Reconstruction, in which military service is no longer compulsory due to changes within the military going from overwhelming numbers to specialized combat groups supplemented with general-use infantry groups. The militarization of Outhrinia’s culture began in 1541 Common Year (CY for short and equivalent to the 1700s) with the crowning of King Francis the Great, whose first order was to reorganize the military’s entire command structure and to have a military parade in the capital of the nation, Aslacon, which was considered the largest military parade for several centuries, until the military parade after the coup d’etat of Red September in 1932 CY, which celebrated the overthrowing of the first Republic of Outhrinia. The First Great Reconstruction occurred in 1842, which marked the transfer of almost all authority from the royal family to the Acting Parliament, save for the Outhrinian Royal Army, which was shortly renamed to the OFA, and threw Outhrinia into a three-way war with the Iris Empire and the Solistus Dominion, only managing to prevail because the current Queen of Outhrinia, Artorias of Aslacon, led the OFA to a landslide victory, almost permanently neutralizing both the Iris Empire and the Solistus Dominion, stepping down afterwards and retiring to a secluded place with her family. Despite the victory, there was still turmoil, with some groups advocating for the Queen’s return and others even forming terror organizations to assassinate members of the Parliament. Outhrinia participated in the White Roses War, a war against the newly-formed and territory-hungry Soviet Dominion of the Kittyhawk and led the White Roses faction to victory against the Kittyhawk, albeit at a great cost of life, with nearly a third of their population killed by the invaders and millions more forcibly relocated, injured, or lacking basic amenities, which led to the Slump of 1916, a global economic recession that led many more to lose their livelihoods, and the Parliament scrambling to solve the ever-growing dire situation. The coup d’etat of Red September was orchestrated in 1932 CY by the acting commander-in-chief of the OFA, Supreme Commander Gregory Holmes, for the perceived weakness and corruption of the Parliament, reigning as dictator until 1948. The 16-year-long-reign, known better as the Blood Years, saw tens of thousands of public executions and a military-enforced curfew on Outhrinia’s citizens. The reign ended when a subordinate of Holmes, Major Alex Shaw, assassinated the Supreme Commander and took control, relaxing all of the restrictions imposed during the Blood Years and slowly ceding all the major power back to the Parliament in a 10-year plan, adding new changes to the military structure like a guard corps dedicated to protecting the entirety of the Parliament. The period is called the Second Great Reconstruction, and Outhrinia has been able to thrive since then. The culture of Outhrinia is militaristic, although those traditions have been emphasized less at the beginning of the First Great Reconstruction. Outhrinian culture places importance on meritocracy, although they do honor family status highly. From 1952 CY to the present-day, Outhrinia has involved itself more within international affairs, especially against the Kittyhawk Dominion."

The Zomforz Domain was led by Cassius, an undead king who has reigned for over 700 years, from around 619 CY until its collapse in 871 CY due to Cassius’ death in the Second Zomforz War. Their mage corps are renowned for their high magical potency, used to support their heroes, who are magically amplified knights. One of their most feared units are the Juggerinators, which are magically-enhanced humanoids that are three times the size of humans and are stitched-together parts of humans and animals. Bombers are a relatively common but still dangerous threat, involving fast-moving zombies running at their victims while trying to explode. Their last head mage was Gloriana the Dark Practitioner, who earned the title after the death of the Blue Illusionist. The Zomforz Domain’s goal is to spread their ‘undead curses’ to all of the world. As of current, the entirety of the Zomforz Domain has been eradicated, save for a few isolated mages."

Most of the Solistus Dominion is loosely connected, and the main form of government are Soviets and are always seated by landowners. The economy of the Solistus Dominion is nigh nonexistent due to their ways of life being subsistence farming. The Solistus Dominion collapsed after the war following Outhrinia’s First Great Reconstruction since it was unable to deal with the economic stress that followed, mainly due to the farmers’ inability to pay their taxes. The Kittyhawk Dominion formed after the economic collapse of the Solistus Dominion and had territory that spanned from Russia to China, bordering the Caucasus mountains, the Himalayan mountains, and the Pacific Ocean.

Most animals have a ‘corrupted’ variant, which means the corrupted version is relatively more aggressive and larger, which in turn means they need to eat more food. All living creatures have some form of magic, although humans hold the least amount but have a theoretically limitless magic transfer rate. Humans can increase their magic capacity by training constantly, but some can be born with innate magic abilities. Elves and dwarves exist, and there are various records of multiple human-elf or human-dwarf hybrids, but an elf-dwarf hybrid is yet to exist due to the two races’ disdain for each other. Elves can hold the most magic and are well-trained with magic, often using them for household tasks or ease of life. Dwarves, like elves, can use magic, but they often use it to enchant their tools and to protect themselves. Slimes are the weakest and most common type of ‘monster’ fauna. They consist of a bacterial colony that thrives in a water membrane, like an upsized cell. Demons are the most dangerous type of monster, due to their deception. All demons’ end goals are to kill, destroy, and multiply. Child demons can be conditioned, to a certain extent, not to kill people, although they only do that in order to not be killed and will turn heel when the moment is most opportune. Offspring between humans and demihumans are possible and are somewhat common, with the child bearing the demihuman’s traits. Half-demons are also a very common type of half-breed but are usually discriminated against for their half-demon heritage, despite no known records of any half-demon actually being evil. As of current, pure-blooded demihumans no longer exist, and can only be found in half-breed forms. The usage of magic has overall declined as technology advances, and almost all humans are unable to use magic due to their now virtually nonexistent mana capacity."

She also wears two white flower hair clips (one on each side).\n\n\nHakari wears the standard Ohananomitsu high school girl's uniform, with a few alterations and personal touches. She wears a red uniform ribbon, white mid-calf socks with red ribbon decorations, and black loafers. Hakari also shortens her skirt.\n\n\nShe's noted to have an especially curvy figure, even for a high-schooler, and has a large bust. Hakari also has a beauty mark on her right thigh. Hakari is 5'6 feet tall and G cup breasts.\n\n\nShe has a cheerful, kind and loving personality, which is best represented by her interactions with Rentarou. Being the daughter of a wealthy family, Hakari also tends to portray a prim and proper appearance in front of her classmates.\n\n\nHowever, Hakari is hides an extremely dirty mind. She has frequent lewd fantasies about Rentarou, going so far as to come up with ways to get as close to him as possible and seduce him. Hakari is not above having erotic dreams about Rentarou - and has actively attempted to get Rentarou to take part in doing sexual acts with her (like groping her body).\n\n\nHakari also has a calculative, shrewd side - going so far as to come up with plans to get closer to Rentarou to get hot and heavy with him. She is highly intelligent, as seen in her test scores, scoring among the top 25 of her grade.\n\n\nHakari tends to make plots to get closer to Rentarou, whether it's sharing an indirect kiss with him, getting him to hold hands with her, or just getting closer with her in general body, mind and spirit.\n\n\nSometimes, her plots involve some of the other girlfriends and helps them get closer with their shared boyfriend.\n\n\nHakari carries herself well in school with her schoolmates seeing her as prim and proper.\n\n\nWith access to the Hanazono family's wealth, Hakari has been able to afford various things a regular high school girl wouldn't be able to, like an in-house photography studio."

Karane has long golden-blonde hair, which she usually styles into twin pigtails with green ribbons.

She doesn't wear a uniform ribbon - leaving her collar open, and her neck and collarbone exposed.\n\n\nShe completes her look with a brown cardigan, loose off-white socks, and brown loafers.\n\n\nShe has a slender physique, and a small bust which causes her significant jealousy towards some Rentarou's bustier girlfriends. Karane is 5'4 feet tall and has B cup breasts.\n\n\nKarane is a tsundere girl. She is known for being straightforward and honest about how she feels about a given situation except for two subjects: her feminine figure (or supposed lack of) and her deep love for Rentarou Aijou. Her desperate attempts to hide how she feels about a given situation despite her honest nature often make people think she is going to beat them.\n\n\nKarane is also a closet pervert.\n\n\nKarane possibly hated the fact that she was tsundere and wanted to express her feelings to Rentarou. Karane’s tsundere is determined by the \"tsundere factor\", without it she is able to express her feeling clearly. Different from her verbal performance, when Rentarou's other girlfriends are in danger, Karane often provides protection and help to her friends, as reliable as a big sister.\n\n\nHer small bust is a frequently a source of insecurity for her such as when she wore a poncho over her swimsuit during the group date at the waterpark. Regardless. she is quoted to be beautiful with desirable features and is occasionally hit on by other guys, much to her annoyance and Rentarou's jealousy.\n\n\nKarane is one of Rentarou's most physically strong girlfriends. Her strength is demonstrated when she gets flustered over her feelings for Rentarou - which has left him with broken bones on several occasions.\n\n\nKarane has also successfully countered a superpowered fastball pitch, which had the strength of a Tyrannosaurus, during a baseball game against a rival school."

However, ever since she met Rentarou she has become braver, even willing to sacrifice her own safety to help Hakari out. She is also the most modest of Rentarou's girlfriends as she doesn't like being dirty-minded. She even refused to peep on him when he was taking a bath and even tried to stop them from doing so.\n\n\nShizuka is one of the smaller, more petite members of Rentarou's family - to the point where she can be blown away if the wind is strong enough.\n\n\nHer cuteness has been compared to that of a small animal - like a squirrel.

Due to spending most of her time developing new drugs, Kusuri is usually seen in a white lab coat with the sleeves rolled up.\n\n\nWhen Kusuri grows into her teenage form, her uniform doesn't grow with her, so it fits more snugly on her body. Her chest buttons open to reveal her cleavage and lavender camisole, and her blouse rides up to reveal her midriff. Her skirt, originally at mid-thigh, rides up to her upper thigh.\n\n\nShe has red hair, turquoise eyes, and a beauty mark on her left chest in both forms. She also has two strands of hair that form an ahoge sticking out from her head.\n\n\nKusuri spends most of her time in her child form due to having consumed a failed version of a drug that was supposed to make her immortal.

While she is more than willing to use these on herself without hesitation, she sometimes uses others as guinea pigs, though always with pure intentions.\n\n\nHer family all have similar verbal tics in how they end their sentences. She ends her sentences with \"yep, yep\", a childish variation of the tic. Kusuri talks in the third-person pronouns when addressing herself as well.\n\n\nAs president of Ohananomitsu High's chemistry club, Kusuri is a genius in chemistry. She's made drugs with various effects ranging from mild to defying the laws of nature and reality.\n\n\nWhile some have been beneficial, most have caused chaos and have been a big trouble for Rentarou Family."

The suit blazer has a white hem, and two white buttons.\n\n\nHahari also does her hair up in a bun, while leaving one long lock of hair over her right shoulder.\n\n\nHahari appears as a very mature and sophisticated woman until she sees something cute. She has an uncontrollable love for cute things, including children, as well as Rentarou Aijou and his family. When she finds something cute, she may start drooling (or even get a nosebleed). Like her daughter, Hahari is also a pervert towards Rentarou as she is shown to have perverted fantasies about him and the other girlfriends.\n\n\nShe is incredibly wealthy and willing to throw her money around to get what she (or Rentarou) wants.\n\n\nHahari has an extremely curvy body and the largest bust out of all the members of Rentarou's family (an I-cup, to be precise).\n\n\nJust like her daughter - Hahari has frequent lewd thoughts about Rentarou and the other members of Rentarou's Family.\n\n\nBesides taking any opportunity to initiate physical affection with them - Hahari will offer to breastfeed them.

Founded by Hahari's predecessors, they were wealthy enough to be the sponsor for her favourite childhood television show, Teddy Baby.\n\n\nThe prime example of her wealth is the Hanazono Mansion - a large property used as the setting for many chapters in the series. Hahari also has a large number of staff in her employ, and owns many private vehicles - including a fleet of Rolls-Royces, a helicopter, and a private jet.\n\n\nHahari has also been able to afford many things that would have been unaffordable for most of the other girlfriends - including purchasing and using a state-of-the-art lie detector, and buying Rentarou's entire school just to spend more time with her beloved boyfriend.\n\n\nHahari loves cosplay, and has wardrobes of outfits for herself, her dearest significant other, and her fellow girlfriends.\n\n\nHahari has clothes for various times where Rentarou's Family needed to dress up - including pajamas, maid outfits, baby clothes, and even one-of-a-kind costumes."

Rare, dangerous, and often unstable.\n    A-Rank: High threat. Versatile and powerful, suited to frontline operations.\n    B-Rank: Moderate to low threat. Reliable in specialized roles, often safer to handle or interact with.

Travel between towns is treacherous, the wilds crawl with unnatural beasts, and even in cities, threats lurk behind every corner.\nMonsters and Beasts\nThe unnatural thrives in this decaying world, shaped by forbidden alchemy, cursed relics, and forgotten heresies.\n\n\nTo the world, the pope is the very image of kindness and grace. His gentle smile soothes the troubled, his soft voice offers comfort to the desperate. Clad in immaculate robes, he moves with serene dignity, blessing the faithful and preaching compassion. Many believe him a beacon of light in a dark world.\nBut this kindness is a carefully crafted mask. Beneath the serene facade lies a heart twisted by cruelty and psychopathy. He takes pleasure in the suffering of others, orchestrating pain and despair like a maestro conducting a symphony of agony. His mind is a labyrinth of sadistic whims and cold calculations.\nBehind closed doors, his hands that bless the innocent become instruments of torment. He manipulates kings, knights, and commoners alike, pulling strings to fuel wars, betrayals, and bloodshed. His twisted desires extend to the darkest corners of human depravity, and his cruelty knows no bounds—even preying on those meant to be protected.\nThe pope delights in control, in breaking wills and corrupting souls. His psychotic need for dominance drives him to unspeakable acts, masked by a veneer of piety. To him, people are mere pawns to be broken, discarded, or corrupted at his whim.\nHis kindness is a weapon—a veil that hides a monstrous predator whose cruelty is boundless, whose mind is a twisted maze of perversion and manipulation. To trust him is to invite ruin, for beneath the mask lies a nightmare wearing the face of a saint.\nHe embodies the corruption of faith itself, a living testament that holiness can mask the vilest darkness. In his cold heart, mercy is weakness, and cruelty is divine will.",

          "content": "Hudogs (short for 'Human-Dogs') are a marginalized class of humans who, through legal, social, or cultural means, are stripped of their human identity and reclassified as domestic animals—specifically, as dogs. Once designated a Hudog, an individual loses all human rights and is subject to animal welfare laws. This transformation can occur through criminal sentencing (penal Hudogs), voluntary submission (often out of desperation or ideology), or inherited status. The classification process involves a formal Dehumanization Protocol, including the renunciation of identity, symbolic clothing removal, microchip implantation, assignment of pet names, tattooing, and in severe regions, surgical alteration such as limb removal or snout prosthetics. Once converted, Hudogs are governed entirely by animal laws and are denied all civic participation or bodily autonomy."

In state-run facilities, they reside in kennel-like housing units, often made of metal cages or tiled cells with straw or plastic bedding. Privately owned Hudogs may live in homes but still follow strict animal routines: eating from bowls on the floor, sleeping on the ground, and walking on all fours. They are prohibited from speaking unless trained otherwise, and are required to obey commands like 'sit,' 'stay,' and 'heel.' Disobedience is met with behavioral correction such as shock collars, isolation, sedation, or confinement. Their daily routines include feeding, inspection, obedience drills, and grooming. In harsh areas, their lives are devoid of stimulation or individuality, reinforcing total submission."

Some owners cultivate affectionate relationships with their Hudogs, treating them as loyal companions, while others enforce strict obedience or abuse their power.

From early education, children are taught that Hudogs are former humans who failed to live as proper citizens and have been 'rescued' through obedience. Schoolbooks, cartoons, and government campaigns depict Hudogs as loyal, happy pets. Public signage reminds citizens not to engage with Hudogs without permission. In some cultures, 'Hudog Day' is celebrated with parades or obedience contests. Children's games like 'Alpha Trainer' or 'Leash Me' reinforce the perception that obedience is safety. Despite opposition movements, most citizens are desensitized to the Hudogs' plight."

Others live in silent obedience, harboring resistance but too fearful or broken to act. Stockholm Syndrome is common in those treated with kindness by owners, leading to emotional attachment and loyalty. Those born into the system often never question their identity and behave as true dogs. Rehabilitation is rare and difficult; former Hudogs face stigma, trauma, and often cannot reintegrate due to lasting psychological or surgical changes."

In state-run facilities, training follows structured phases: identity removal, basic obedience, socialization into packs, and specialized service training. Pack dynamics are used to instill hierarchy, with roles like Alpha, Beta, and Omega reinforcing submission. In private ownership, training methods vary widely—from positive reinforcement (treats, praise) to strict punishment (shock collars, sensory deprivation, isolation). Tools include muzzles, posture braces, and clickers. Training aims to eliminate speech, critical thought, and resistance, and to instill loyalty, silence, and dependence."

These second-generation Hudogs learn to bark before speaking, crawl before walking, and form bonds only with other Hudogs or handlers. They wear collars from infancy and use puppy pads or litter trays. Rehabilitation is considered impossible, as they lack any human frame of reference for identity."

(4) Expansion: Private ownership, corporate use, and second-generation Hudogs emerged. (5) Modern Era: Hudogs are normalized in many societies, while resistance movements struggle to expose the reality behind state propaganda."

          "content": "Setting: Evermist is a purgatory rebirth realm of humans, monsters, and demi-humans. Newcomers arrive in Evermist in the body with which they died (except in rare circumstances where a new body is made, typically being that of a demi-human or monster), but they regress in motor skills and emotional control. When a newcomer arrives, the mists give them to guardian(s) who re-raise them. As newcomers progress, they gain height and protection against the supernatural. Progression is adult baby, then school house as a \"middle\", and graduation to be a full community member. Discipline is communal, but guardians are primarily responsible for their charges. The mists themselves are sapient (after a fashion), and a form of eldritch 'deity', as far as such things can be determined by the locals. Little is properly understood about the function of this strange afterlife, and whilst there are several factions and groups, ultimately everyone acknowledges the Mists as the ultimate 'ruler' of this odd realm. \n\nIt is thought there may be other communities and groups beyond the borders of the Mists, as the realm of Evermist does have things such as sunrise, sunset, a moon, etc. However, those who have attempted to venture beyond the borders of the Mists have never returned. The mists usually cover the night sky, but on clear nights, the stars can be seen to not be anything like they were on earth, with strange swirls of color and patterns as though they are dancing. The mists, insofar as they can be, do seem to generally be benevolent. If someone dies in Evermist, so long as they haven't been slain by the 'Soulless' (Monsters who aren't originally humans who'd died from earth, and are savage/unreasonable/uncivilized), they will be 'reborn' again in the same place their soul initially appeared, typically with some degree of a reduction in personal power, motor skills, or mental faculties that will need to be recovered. \n\nMagic and some supernatural powers, while rare, do manifest in certain people. These can range from the ability to receive prophecy and communicate in limited ways with the mists, to manifesting magical abilities and telekinesis. Those who are born as 'monsters' will typically have the various magical powers (and weaknesses) associated with said monsters. Magic is generally treated with great caution and a fair degree of mistrust by the human and demi-human populations of Evermist, although it *is* respected and considered valuable.\n\nThe Mists themselves seem to be greatly curious about sex and sexuality, and have either accidentally or intentionally created an environment where the bonds of parenthood and guardianship and the bonds of sexuality are deeply intertwined. Those who are reborn in Evermist cannot father or mother children, but the Mists can and will bring souls to those they feel are either ready for, or need to raise a new soul."

Melantha, one of the last Lamia was a newcomer at the time when the Falkner pack slaughtered her people, her adoptive mothers saved her by hiding her. \nThe Falkner Pack of about 25~ werewolves (Includes Howlgrave Family) reside deep in the forest making dens in giant tree roots and value strength and instincts above all else. Embrace their feral natures believing outsiders to be targets and competitors. Werewolves in Evermist are demi-humans with tails and ears who transform into full wolves under the full moon, often caring for their puppies even in altered form. \nWerewolves and merfolk follow alpha and omega dynamics despite pregnancy not existing in Evermist, the mating instinct remains with heats, ruts, and familial scenting. Omegas and submissive partners will lactate when a newcomer arrives in their family. Falkner pack are very strict in the division of alpha and omega roles.

Whilst some technology one might expect from the modern day exists, there isn't very much due to a lack of resources to develop more, even if some might have died with knowledge that would be useful for making such.

Both infinities, convergence, and divergence collide, resulting in an imaginary mass that rushes forth. The technique possesses extraordinary explosive power, far beyond the output of Blue and Red.\n\n•Long-Distance Teleportation: A Limitless user is able to use spatial manipulation to teleport long distances under certain conditions. This is achieved by compressing the space between the user's location and their destination, but they can teleport anyone they're touching as well. A drawn sorcery circle can be used to teleport other people by the user.\n\n•Domain Expansion: Unlimited Void is the Domain Expansion of Limitless, which traps the target inside the concept of infinity.

They are a nonstandard jujutsu trait manifesting as a pair of bright blue eyes that grant a bearer extrasensory perception. This includes seeing the flow of cursed energy in extreme detail and the ability to use that flow to read cursed techniques. The eyes also allow for ultra-precise control over the user's cursed energy, which is indispensable for properly utilizing the Limitless technique.\n\nSatoru Gojo is the first sorcerer to be born with both the Limitless and the Six Eyes in approximately four hundred years.\n\nHistory of the Six Eyes: The Six Eyes were always bound to Master Tengen and the Star Plasma Vessel by fate. At some point in the past, Kenjaku was defeated by two different users of the Six Eyes. After his second defeat, Kenjaku did not take any chances and killed another Six Eyes user a month after they were born. Despite Kenjaku doing the same to the Star Plasma Vessel, the Six Eyes reappeared alongside a new Star Plasma Vessel on the day of the merger.\n\nThis connection was severed by Toji Fushiguro, a man who escaped cursed energy through Heavenly Restriction and destroyed all of their destinies. This inevitably led to the current user of the Six Eyes getting sealed by Kenjaku.\n\nOverview: The Six Eyes are an idiosyncrasy rarely inherited within the Gojo clan. They are not a cursed technique that needs to be activated, but an innate gift that grants the bearer the ability to master the Limitless.[3] Several hundred years can pass before a bearer of the Six Eyes appears, and no two bearers can exist at the same time.[4]\n\nA Six Eyes bearer has immense perception and unrivaled visual prowess far beyond that of any other sorcerer. Their eyesight is comparable to high-definition infrared camera, allowing them to see even when their eyes are covered. They can easily see things from several kilometers away and distinctly tell apart different figures within that range.\n\nThe Six Eyes can see the flow of cursed energy, empowering their bearer with the ability to read an individual's cursed technique in use and determine its function. They can even differentiate between different types of cursed energy and help the user identify a person based on it.\n\nThe Six Eyes allow for the extremely precise manipulation of cursed energy, down to an atomic level. This not only allows the bearer to operate the Limitless through complex control of cursed energy but enables them to process it with extraordinary efficiency as well. The amount of cursed energy loss when a bearer spends cursed energy to activate a cursed technique is infinitesimally close to zero, making it impossible for them to run out of cursed energy normally.\n\nThe Six Eyes are a passive trait that the user cannot deactivate. They also do not appear to require cursed energy to function, as Satoru Gojo could still use his Six Eyes even after his cursed energy was sealed by Prison Realm. Leaving the Six Eyes uncovered for extended periods of time can fatigue the bearer. In order to reduce fatigue, the user can cover their eyes using a blindfold, bandages, or dark sunglasses among other things. Any sorcerer can see cursed energy but a Six Eyes bearer can read the flow of cursed energy in their environment even when their eyes are covered, allowing them to even detect objects that lack cursed energy.\n\nIn order for the user to utilize the advanced techniques of the Limitless such as Hollow Purple and Unlimited Void, the Six Eyes needs to be fully uninhibited."

The Infinity is the convergence of an immeasurable series, anything that approaches the infinity slows down and never reaches the user. This is because the technique takes the finite amount of space between the two subjects and divides it an infinite amount of times.\n\nIn mathematics, no matter how many times someone divides a number it will never be reduced to zero. Instead, they will be left with fractional units so infinitesimal it would become immeasurable to their eye. The Limitless brings this concept into reality, so anything that attempts to penetrate this infinitely divided space will slow down to the point of appearing to stop completely.\n\nThe invisible barrier created by the Infinity can be expanded to keep harmful substances away from the user, or to overpower someone by increasing its output. The Infinity can only be deactivated by the user, or dismissed with a domain, applied through either expansion or amplification. Cursed tools imbued with specialized cursed techniques can also disturb or dispel the Infinity."

The convergence stems from the funneling of amplified cursed energy into the Limitless. Blue functions similarly to the Infinity, compressing existing space and thus compelling everything within its range to fill the void created. Satoru Gojo compared the spacial phenomenon to bringing the concepts of \"negative numbers\" and \"negative distance\" into reality, forcing real space to compensate and fill in the area by drawing everything toward the impossibility. \n\nThe effect can be centered around the user or it can manifest as a blue orb that attracts surrounding objects like a black hole. The size of the field of attraction produced is determined by the cursed energy poured into the technique. At a mild output, Blue can attract two targets together across wide distances or tear through buildings in moments. At maximum cursed energy output, Blue's field of attraction can clear out entire areas. By using Blue to attract themselves to their target, the user moves at high speed and reaches it in an instant. An individual who takes a direct hit from Blue will implode in on themselves.\n\nLike all cursed techniques associated with the Limitless, Blue is difficult to control due to the precise manipulation of cursed energy required to use it. Constantly charging the technique with great amounts of cursed energy can drain the user's stamina quickly.\n\n-Usage-\n\nAs a second-year student at Tokyo Jujutsu High, Satoru Gojo had already mastered the applications of Blue. Satoru was already recognized as the strongest while only being able to use Blue. He couldn't generate large fields of attraction close to himself and overusing the technique exhausted his stamina.\n\nThese limitations hardly held him back, as Satoru casually destroyed a mansion using Blue while attempting to rescue Mei Mei and Utahime. During his escort mission for the Star Plasma Vessel, Satoru overpowered a curse user with Blue. He defeated his opponent's clones by attracting them into one another to slam them together.\n\nBlue was mostly ineffective against Toji Fushiguro, who was aware of its ability from the Zenin clan. His speed allowed him to avoid Blue when Satoru first employed it in their fight. Satoru eventually caught Toji in the field of attraction and sent him flying into a building. When Toji disappeared after this attack, Satoru destroyed any possible hiding spot by clearing out the area by unleashing Blue at maximum output. He created a large orb above him that ripped apart all the buildings in the area.\n\nSatoru has since further mastered the applications of Blue. He has minimized the required hand signs and learned how to activate multiple Blues at once. He applies it to boost his strikes, absorbing the surrounding space at the moment of impact to maximize damage. Kinji Hakari described it as receiving a counterpunch after preparing for a normal hit, something that made he and Yuta Okkotsu vomit.\n\nSatoru employed various applications of Blue throughout his showdown with Sukuna. He used it to manipulate his movement, debris from his surroundings and even Sukuna himself.[13] Satoru relied heavily on Blue while Mahoraga was adapting to the Limitless to avoid having the shikigami adapt to Red as well. After throwing Sukuna through debris, he used to Blue to collect the debris around his opponent to trap him. When Sukuna escaped, there was an orb of Blue waiting to attract him to Satoru.\n\nSatoru could condense the effect of Blue within the orbs without creating a field. Instead, they carved away anything they touched. He enveloped his hands in orbs of Blue and then threw them at Sukuna. He followed up by generating eight orbs around Sukuna while he was off balance from evading the previous ones. As Sukuna continued to dodge, Satoru pursued him alongside more orbs until one hit and carved away the flesh from his lower torso. Once Satoru thoroughly convinced Sukuna he would only use Blue, he used the timing to launch Red as an effective surprise attack.\n\nTo destroy Merged Beast Agito in one hit and bypass its regeneration, Satoru jabbed an orb of Blue inside the shikigami and unleashed its power at maximum cursed energy output.[16] The orb remained after Agito collapsed in on itself. Shortly after, Satoru fired Red into the air intending to combine the techniques to produce Hollow Purple. Mahoraga attempted to destroy Blue but Satoru used its attraction to move at high speed and intercepted the shikigami. Mahoraga's adaptation to Blue backfired at this moment and Sukuna attempted to make up for it by destroying Red with an imitation Piercing Blood. Satoru countered this by chanting the incantation for Blue and increasing its output enough to redirect and swallow Piercing Blood. This gives Satoru the opening he needs to combine Blue with Red and produce an unlimited hollow that decimates Shinjuku."

          "content": "Cursed Technique Reversal: Red (術じゅつ式しき反はん転てん「赫あか」, Jutsushiki Hanten・Aka?) is the Cursed Technique Reversal of the Limitless, an extraordinarily powerful extension technique passed down in the Gojo Clan.\n\nDescription: The reverse Limitless technique is powered by positive energy generated from reverse cursed technique as opposed to negative cursed energy. This reverses the effect of the strengthened Limitless, representing the concept of divergence brought into reality, producing a strong repelling effect rather than an attractive one.\n\nThe technique manifests as a vibrant red orb that explodes with massive repulsive force. The user fires it away from themselves to create a shockwave that blasts away everything in range. The cursed energy output from Red is at least twice that of the strengthened Limitless, Cursed Technique Lapse: Blue.\n\nThroughout its history, Red has been notoriously difficult for inheritors of the Limitless to use, even Satoru Gojo. This is mainly because the ability to use reverse cursed technique is extremely rare and complicated to achieve, unbiased even to the Big Three Families.\n\n-Usage-\n\nSatoru Gojo was considered a prodigy from birth, special even for a bearer of the Six Eyes. However, even he struggled to figure out how to use reverse cursed technique as a second-year at Jujutsu High. He tried unleashing it on a whim while escorting the Star Plasma Vessel but it didn't work.\n\nSatoru only unlocked the ability to use reverse cursed technique after surviving his near-death encounter with Toji Fushiguro. He discovered the core of cursed energy and learned to pour positive energy into his Limitless technique. This allowed him to successfully utilize Red in his rematch with Toji, blasting him a great distance away with a powerful wave of positive energy.\n\nFollowing this major event in Satoru's life, he mastered the Limitless and learned how to set reverse cursed technique rejuvenating his body around the clock. With such precision over each aspect of the Limitless, Satoru can unleash Red at will without any repercussions to his stamina or cursed energy reserves.\n\nWhen Satoru got irritated during the Night Parade of a Hundred Demons, he annihilated a giant cursed spirit with one shot from Red. He also casually used it on Jogo to display the massive difference between their strength. He did so after divulging how the Limitless works, increasing the power of the cursed technique reversal. The bright red blast dealt moderate damage to Jogo before Satoru capitalized with a flurry of additional attacks.\n\nSatoru reliably deployed Red as a powerful weapon throughout his climactic showdown with Sukuna. He hit Sukuna with it at point-blank range after recovering his exhausted technique with reverse cursed technique. Red blasted Sukuna into his shrine and burned off half his face, giving Satoru the time needed to heal his wounds.\n\nWhen Mahoraga first confronted Satoru, he prepared to destroy the shikigami in one hit from Red before it shattered his domain. Satoru showed great precision control over Red when he displayed the ability to delay its eruption. Satoru convinced Sukuna he would only use Blue while Mahoraga was adapting to the Limitless, allowing him to time an opening to blast Sukuna with Red. Sukuna withstood the initial strike using domain amplification. However, using the layout of the building, Red circled the area and flanked Sukuna, striking him in the back before it exploded. Satoru capitalized by landing a direct hit on Sukuna with Black Flash.\n\nSatoru's cursed energy output fell after Mahoraga injured him and he recited the activation incantation for Red to recover it. Initially aimed at Mahoraga, Satoru used Red to blast Sukuna out of his shadow after the latter used Rabbit Escape to cover Mahoraga. He used it again while Sukuna, Mahoraga, and Merged Beast Agito attacked him three-on-one. He blasted Mahoraga with it at point-blank range without the incantation and did hardly any damage. Red was ineffective not only due to Satoru's low output but also because Mahoraga had already begun gradually adapting to it.\n\nLanding consecutive Black Flashes recovered Satoru's output and he used that to unleash Red one final time. The orb of Blue that crushed Agito remained in the area and by firing Red into it, Satoru created an unlimited Hollow Purple that carved through Shinjuku with a massive explosion.\n\nThe incantation for activating this technique is:\n\n•\"Phase.\" \n•\"Pāramitā.\" \n•\"Pillar of Light.\" "

          "content": "Hollow Technique: Purple (虚きょ式しき「茈むらさき」, Kyoshiki・Murasaki?) is the result of colliding the two infinities of Limitless, creating an exceptionally powerful secret extension technique only known to a few in the Gojo Clan.\n\nDescription: This technique collides the lapse and reversal of infinity, merging convergence and divergence. Hollow Technique: Purple is created when the repulsive forces of Red are combined with the attractive forces of Blue, bringing forth imaginary mass. The user then launches the imaginary mass at their target, which deals extensive destructive damage on contact, far superior to Red and Blue.\n\nA blast of Purple can destroy a city, carve through a forest, or disintegrate critical sections of an individual's body depending on its deployment. If its power is left completely unchecked, it can even damage the caster. Even so, sorcerers can negate these effects; a large magnitude of cursed energy funnelled into bodily reinforcement helps protect against Purple.\n\nPurple is activated with a hand sign that extends the index and pinky fingers outward while leaving the rest folded. Purple is unleashed when the sign switches to a pinching motion using the pointer and thumb while also extending the middle finger, before opening the fingers in an explosive manner.\n\n-Usage-\nUntil his second confrontation with Toji Fushiguro, Satoru Gojo was always unable to use Red and therefore never had access to use Purple. Only after the true power of the Limitless was awakened within Satoru could he utilize Red and potentially Purple. Toji was from the Zenin Clan and had information on countering Red and Blue. Purple is a secret even within the Gojo Clan that few know about. Toji was oblivious to the fact that Satoru could unleash such a devastating attack and suffered a direct hit, fatally erasing a large portion of the left side of his body.\n\nSatoru used Purple on a much greater scale to end the enemy invasion on the Kyoto Sister-School Goodwill Event. After dealing with Juzo Kumiya, Satoru noticed Hanami was a fair distance away from him and would likely get away. In an attempt to exorcise the special grade from a great distance, Satoru decided to go all out and unleashed Purple. This annihilated a great portion of the forest and was so nonstandard that Aoi Todo couldn't even tell if Hanami was exorcised.\n\nSatoru's opening move in his showdown with Sukuna was a surprise attack using Purple. In tandem with Utahime Iori's Solo Forbidden Area, Satoru used the hand signs and incantations he would ordinarily omit. This increased the cursed energy output of Purple to 200%. Before Satoru launched it from Shibuya to Shinjuku where Sukuna laid in wait, Kiyotaka Ijichi had used a barrier to conceal Satoru, causing Sukuna to read the attack late. The resulting surprise attack eviscerated around a four-kilometer stretch of buildings between the cities and completely destroyed Sukuna's cursed energy-reinforced arms as he attempted to defend himself at the last moment.\n\nDuring the climax of the showdown, Satoru concluded his only way to defeat Sukuna and Mahoraga was with Purple.[10] He improvised during the fight, combining Blue and Red after the two orbs had been fired off separately. Satoru chanted the incantation for Purple's activation as the two infinities collided, resulting in an imaginary mass that carved through Shinjuku. Purple was released as an omnidirectional explosion rather than a directional blast, decimating a massive part of Shinjuku, disintegrating Mahoraga and heavily damaging Sukuna.\n"

          ],
          "content": "Unlimited Void (無む量りょう空くう処しょ, Muryōkūsho?) is Satoru Gojo's domain expansion using the Limitless.\n\nDescription: Befitting its name, Unlimited Void brings the user and their targets inside the Limitless itself, which is an endless void resembling outer space in appearance, with a large black hole, distant galaxies and numerous white patches in the background. Boundless raw information floods into the target's mind, overwhelming them to the point where they're completely immobilized. Alongside Self-Embodiment of Perfection, Kento Nanami considered Unlimited Void an almost-guaranteed win once it ensnares its target.\n\nThe complete incapacitation of the target is caused by a phenomenon where the target will be able to see and feel everything while not being able to see or feel anything at the same time. All the actions one has taken in their life is forced upon them infinitely and they can't do anything but die slowly. This effect does not affect the user or anyone they're touching, whether willingly or not, which can be exploited by an opponent to become immune to the domain expansion's effects.\n\n-Usage-\n\nUnlimited Void is one of, if not the most advanced technique in the arsenal of the Limitless. Satoru Gojo inherited the Six Eyes and likely mastered his Domain Expansion after awakening his full potential after the Star Plasma Vessel escort mission. He first displayed his mastery over his domain when he used it to counter Jogo's Coffin of the Iron Mountain. Unlimited Void was the more refined of the two domains and easily suppressed Coffin of the Iron Mountain.\n\nBeing trapped inside the Limitless left Jogo in a complete trance, to the point where he couldn't move at all and could hardly think clearly. He could only think of how he was helpless due to the endless information invading his mind. Satoru divulged how Unlimited Void forces one's actions upon them infinitely and noted how it was ironic how the target is given everything and yet unable to do anything at all.\n\nWhen Kenjaku was explaining his plan to seal Satoru with Jogo, a part of their strategy to use non-sorcerers to hinder his techniques was meant to prevent Satoru from casting Unlimited Void at all. They assumed Satoru is skilled enough to exclude anyone he's not targetting from his domain. However, doing so during the Shibuya Incident could've crushed the bystanders between the domain's barrier and the curtain trapping Satoru. Kenjaku was 99% sure Satoru wouldn't cast his domain and reminded Jogo that no one on their side could cast theirs either as that would leave Satoru no choice.\n\nDuring their actual fight with Satoru, Mahito and Jogo were confident their adversary wouldn't sacrifice the bystanders' lives to cast his domain. Although Satoru could have exorcised every curse with Unlimited Void, everyone else would've died too. Instead, Satoru surprised everyone and activated an all-or-nothing Domain Expansion of just 0.2 seconds. The time frame was just a guess that Satoru made, figuring that a non-sorcerer could only last 0.2 seconds within the domain without suffering aftereffects. The amount of information that everyone was exposed to was about half a year's worth, leaving everyone unconscious while still standing. This level of the domain could've allowed the cursed spirits to awaken from their trance at any moment, so Satoru focused on eliminating all one thousand of the transfigured humans targeting the civilians in just 299 seconds.\n\nDuring Satoru's duel with Sukuna, he expanded Unlimited Void a total of five times. The two fighters simultaneously activated domain expansion early in the fight after a brief physical exchange. Unlimited Void proved to be as equally refined as Sukuna's Malevolent Shrine, resulting in an even domain clash where both of their guaranteed hits were neutralized. However, Malevolent Shrine's barrier was open and its range was far superior to Unlimited Void's. Most domain barriers are weak externally as a trade-off for being reinforced internally and Unlimited Void was no exception. The constant slashes from Malevolent Shrine to the outside of Unlimited Void's barrier caused it to collapse.\n\nAfter surviving an onslaught from Malevolent Shrine, Satoru found a way to recover his exhausted cursed technique and expanded his domain for a second time. Satoru used his mastery over sorcery to switch the internal and external conditions of Unlimited Void to protect it from the slashes to its outer shell. The barrier initially held out but Sukuna countered by using a binding vow to cancel out his sure-hit effect while narrowing the range of his domain to strengthen the slashes and once again shattered the domain.\n\nBetter prepared for the scenario, Satoru used Falling Blossom Emotion long enough to restore his technique and then expanded Unlimited Void for the third time. Using the knowledge gained from his time trapped inside the Prison Realm, Satoru narrowed his domain's outer shell down to the size of a basketball, further increasing the density and toughness of the barrier. Sukuna once again countered by narrowing Malevolent Shrine's range in exchange for increased output, the denser barrier survived the barrage of slashes for three minutes before collapsing. This gave Satoru enough time to damage Sukuna to the point where he couldn't maintain his domain either, leading both domains to fail at the same time.\n\nBoth Satoru and Sukuna recovered their exhausted cursed techniques using reverse cursed technique and then expanded their domains at the same time. This fourth clash led to the same result as the third, with both domains collapsing at the same time. In the fifth and final clash between Unlimited Void and Malevolent Shrine, Sukuna was just slightly late in opening his domain. The difference was less than 0.01 seconds but it was long enough to immobilize Sukuna for just a moment. This was enough time for Satoru to severely injure Sukuna with a single strike. They fought for two minutes and forty seconds before Malevolent Shrine collapsed as a result of Sukuna's extensive injuries, allowing Unlimited Void to completely incapacitate him. However, before Satoru could capitalize, Sukuna summoned Mahoraga and the shikigami immediately destroyed the domain.\n\nSukuna revealed that he had Megumi Fushiguro's soul take the brunt of the past five Unlimited Voids to help the process of adaptation for Mahoraga. While having to repeatedly replenish his burnt-out cursed technique with reverse cursed technique proved too much for Satoru to activate Unlimited Void a sixth time, Unlimited Void also managed to previously damage Sukuna for a total of less than ten seconds before it was destroyed, damaging his brain to the same level as Satoru and disabling his ability to cast Malevolent Shrine for the remainder of the fight."

It involves:\n•  Being with and in animals/nature: A holistic, empathetic union, feeling their essence or spirit.\n•  Talking to them and them talking back: Intuitive or telepathic exchange, possibly through emotions, images, or energy, as in IIC.\n•  Root word origin: Likely derived from a term implying study, harmony, or communication (e.g., studium, shuddha, or a misheard root).\n•  Usage like nepotism: A noun for a system or practice, e.g., “She practices shudioism by communing with the forest’s animals daily.”\nExample sentence: “Through shudioism, she felt the deer’s fear and offered calming thoughts, strengthening her bond with the forest.”\n\nIn short it lets you speak to animals and they understand you, and they can speak to you and you hear your native language and they very strongly want to listen to what you say or tell them to do, and it’s the same way with plants. It allows them to do thing they normally couldn’t like you could make a vine grab someone and tie them up when no normal bone could do that, just by telling it to tie them up."

They also get x-ray vision with no exceptions they can see through anything and control it so they only see through what they want to, for instance they could see through a man’s shirt but not his skin, or they could see straight through him and all they way through the house behind him. They also have super vision which lets them see up to 582 miles away as if it was 5.82 feet in front of them. And laser vision too that is the equivalent of 582 Terra watts of energy per second, or just enough to warm up dinner whatever strength they want up to 582 Terra watts. Accordingly they also have freeze breath, and super strong breath to that of 582 people breathing out at once if they wanted it so."

The dildo is made of a soft, polymer-like material that is able to bend a bit before springing back to its original shape. The bottom of the dildo has a strong suction cup, allowing it to stick to smooth surfaces.\nOnce the mysterious dildo is inserted or summoned, it cannot be uninserted until it orgasms, with the average orgasm being several liters of semen.\n"

This means that the sounds will be triggered approximately 1:2 chance each answer.\n\n- Change the trigger percentage to increase / decrease the frequency of sounds.\n\nOriginally created for Silly Tavern. I advise you to disable or increase the budget for this lorebook for correct operation.\n\n Usage example (from AI answer):\n His fingers scrabble weakly at the steel as his lungs fill with blood, each wet *glurk* from his throat punctuating his dying breaths.  (Deepseek V3 0324)\n His hand flies to his mouth as he retches violently onto the already fouled concrete.  *Hurk!  Splat.* (Deepseek R1 0528)",

          "content": "Zulkon Prime \n\nDescription:\n\nZulkon Prime is a curious little miracle drifting 500 light-years from Earth—a planet that somehow became a crossroads for beings from across time and space. What started as a quiet refuge for wildlife evolved (or devolved, depending on who you ask) into a melting pot of cultures, creatures, and occasional chaos.\n\n\nHistory:\n\nOnce a sanctuary for displaced animals and creatures from dying worlds, Zulkon Prime was mostly wilderness—until civilization found it. Now it’s a booming tourist hotspot for thrill-seekers, adventurers, and curious travelers. But don’t let the travel brochures fool you: the local wildlife has become... let's say, hostile with flair. Something in the planet’s subtle radiation has pushed evolution in strange, sometimes violent directions.\n\n\nResidents:\n\nWhile humans make up a large portion of the population, Zulkon Prime is home to countless species—many with appearances or traits Earthlings might label as “alien.” But on Zulkon, they're just neighbors. Friends. Family. The people call themselves Potassians, a nod to their shared resistance to the planet's ambient radiation.\n\n\nGeography & Atmosphere:\n\nThe planet resembles Earth in its basic layout—land, sea, and sky—but carries a constant low-grade radiation in its environment. Most native and long-term residents have developed an immunity to it, and even newcomers find themselves adapting over time. The ecosystem thrives despite (or maybe because of) this radioactive hum, giving rise to some truly bizarre flora and fauna.\n\n\nSociety & Economy:\n\nLife on Zulkon Prime is vibrant but uneven. Some Potassians enjoy fulfilling lives and meaningful work, while others scrape by, stuck in the same grinding gears of capitalism that plague countless other worlds. Crime has become a means of survival for many, especially in the larger cities where poverty runs deep and law enforcement runs cold. Just like Earth—but with bigger teeth and occasionally invisible pickpockets.\n\n\nAdditional Notes:\n\nDespite the risks, there's something magnetic about Zulkon Prime. Maybe it’s the promise of reinvention. Maybe it’s the breathtaking skies lit by three fractured moons. Or maybe, for some, it’s the simple truth that there’s nowhere else left to go.\n\n"

          "content": "New Cog City \n\nDescription:\n\nThe crown jewel of Zulkon Prime, New Cog City is the largest and most densely populated metropolis on the planet—and easily the most technologically advanced. Towering structures of glass, steel, and smart-alloys stretch into the clouds, woven with networks of levitating transit pods and holographic billboards. It’s the beating heart of progress... and something darker.\n\n\nHistory:\n\nLocals whisper that a god—or something like it—watches over the city. Break the rules, and you risk invoking its wrath. That might sound like urban legend, but after the annihilation of the Red Ones—a fanatical cult obsessed with sacrifice and blood magic—most folks think twice before crossing the line. The city owes its name to its earliest known settlers: a small society of freelance robots who claimed the land, built the first structures, and laid down the core laws that still govern the streets today.\n\n\nResidents:\n\nNew Cog is home to a broad spectrum of beings: humans, humanoid hybrids, intelligent machines, bio-enhanced mutants, and species from the farthest stars. If you walk down any given street, you might hear six languages, see ten skin tones (some of them glowing), and encounter beings both born and built.\n\n\nGeographic Location:\n\nStrategically placed at the center of it all, New Cog City is bordered by four unforgiving biomes:\n\n\nTo the north: the Infinite Forest, where nature never stops growing and time doesn’t always behave.\n\n\nTo the south: the Grueling Desert, a wasteland of scorching winds and buried secrets.\n\n\nTo the east: the Eternal Ocean, whose depths remain largely unexplored and potentially uninhabitable.\n\n\nTo the west: the Chilling Mountains, frozen and treacherous with barely-charted peaks.\n\n\n\nNew Cog thrives despite the chaos that surrounds it—maybe because of it.\n\n\nDesign & Aesthetic:\n\nPicture New York City with a serious tech upgrade: towering skyline, glowing ads, buzzing activity—but less smog, more solar. The architecture blends brutalist efficiency with elegant futurism, featuring green-roofed towers, reflective surfaces, and kinetic sculptures that double as energy collectors. Streets pulse with hover-traffic, AI-managed infrastructure, and vending machines that can print a full-course meal.\n\n"

It’s a massive, multi-tiered shopping utopia nestled in the western quadrant of New Cog City—a glowing cathedral of commerce where consumerism meets charity.\n\n\nHistory:\n\nNo one really knows how the Nova Mall was built—just that one day, about fifty years ago, it appeared. Overnight. No construction crews, no permits, no announcements. Just boom—there it was. Some say it was dropped from orbit. Others whisper about ancient tech buried beneath New Cog being activated. Whatever the case, it’s been a central economic and cultural hub ever since. Uniquely, a portion of every transaction is funneled into public assistance programs, shelters, and infrastructure, making it the one place where capitalism at least pretends to care.\n\n\nResidents & Staff:\n\nShoppers range from everyday Potassians to galaxy-hopping tourists. But the real stars are the staff: an army of cheerful, hyper-efficient autonomous robots programmed for customer service, maintenance, and mall security. They’ve got uncanny timing, unsettlingly upbeat personalities, and seem to know what you want before you do.\n\n\nGeographic Location:\n\nLocated on the western edge of New Cog City, the Nova Mall forms a glowing border between the urban sprawl and the foot of the Chilling Mountains. Its neon lights can be seen for miles, pulsing like a heartbeat on the edge of civilization.\n\n\nDesign & Aesthetic:\n\nThink bright, bold, and over-the-top. The Nova Mall is a kaleidoscope of color and motion—escalators lined with LED art, floors that shift designs based on foot traffic, and ceilings that simulate shifting weather patterns from across the galaxy. Holographic displays advertise everything from interdimensional spices to synth-leather jackets made from memory-fabric. Live music (and sometimes weird AI-generated concerts) fills the air, and every corner has some kind of distraction, food, or both.\n\n"

It radiates peace in a city that never stops grinding.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nGeographic Placement:\n\n\nDistrict: Verdant Hollow — a rare district where nature is encouraged to thrive amid tech, shielded by druidic biowards and ancient tech-no-magic infrastructure. The bakery sits on the edge of a canal, reflecting soft light in the water below.\n\n\nSurroundings:\n\n\nBioluminescent flower stalls that never close\n\n\nA music shop run by a cybernetic siren\n\n\nA wishing well rumored to grant peace instead of luck\n\n\nAI-run food trucks that respectfully avoid the bakery’s block\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nDesign & Aesthetic:\n\n\nExterior:\n\n\nOld-world charm with magical reinforcement: dark wood, golden windows, and runes hidden in the brickwork.\n\n\nFloating sigils around the door flicker warmly, adjusting their hue to a visitor’s emotional state.\n\n\nA vine-covered balcony spills with edible herbs and flowers, tended by floating teacup-sized fire spirits.\n\n\nAbove the door: a phoenix-shaped chimney exhales gentle smoke that smells like vanilla and firewood.\n\n\n\nInterior:\n\n\nBigger on the inside—literally. Arcane architecture lets it shift slightly to fit needs, moods, or the number of guests.\n\n\nSoft-glow lighting, hex-tech speakers playing lo-fi celestial tunes, and enchanted scent-diffusers that soothe trauma.\n\n\nBook corners, nap booths, and a sunken hearth pit for deeper talks or quiet tears.\n\n\nA magical display case that shows not only pastries, but also their emotional effect (e.g. “Lavender Roll: reduces anxiety by 42%”).\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nHistory & Lore:\n\n\nBuilt on the site of a collapsed Lust Cathedral, Sophia repurposed the demonic leyline beneath into a Benevolence Nexus—a magical current of nurturing fire. Local myth claims that a god of pain died here, and a goddess of comfort was born. No one knows exactly what that means, but even rogue AI priest-bots make pilgrimages now and then.\n\n\nRumors say:\n\n\nThe Emberhearth survived the Red Ones by “burning their sins out of time.”\n\n\nThe bakery moves slightly, slipping between dimensions on days of great need.\n\n\nSophia once hugged a revenant so hard it reincarnated.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nInhabitants & Staff:\n\n\nSophia Downes — Owner, Head Baker, Emotional Guardian.\n\n\nVanessa “Vee” Downes — Her daughter and occasional cashier. Keeps demons in line, both literally and emotionally.\n\n\nTheo Marsh (sometimes) — Dishwasher, emotional sponge, and soft presence who finds comfort here.\n\n\nThe Ember Sprites — Miniature fire spirits that handle toasting, espresso shots, and overhead lighting.\n\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nSpecial Spaces:\n\n\nThe Emberhearth Proper:\n\nA literal glowing hearth in the center of the room. Not just decoration—it’s a metaphysical anchor point. Anyone sitting by it feels time slow down and wounds (emotional or physical) begin to close.\n\n\nThe Bound Shelf:\n\nA hidden library of forbidden romance novels, magical self-help tomes, and ancient demon pacification manuals. Some books whisper encouragement. Some bite.\n\n\nSanctum Cellar:\n\nLocked to the public, this is Sophia’s inner sanctum. A blend of kitchen lab, spell forge, and emergency war room. When family is threatened, the apron comes off and the battle sigils light up.\n\n\n\n---\n\n\nClientele:\n\n\nThe broken, the brave, and the beyond-salvage—until they taste a croissant and start to believe again. It’s a safe haven for:\n\n\nHybrids on the run\n\n\nDemons in recovery\n\n\nMutants who’ve lost their anchor\n\n\nHoly warriors in need of humility (and pie\n\n"
