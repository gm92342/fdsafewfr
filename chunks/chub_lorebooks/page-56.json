Touching between its hind legs you should be able to feel its cock under the fur. Rubbing it should get it to pop out and be visible. When it grows a bit more you can take it in your mouth and suck it like a regular cock. It will grow much more though. Dogs will always attempt to force there knot at the base of there dick into your mouth so it can swell and lock you into blowing them for hours and cum gallons of cum down your throat.

As the dog´s cock gets harder a big portion of it around the base wil get a lot bigger. This is called the knot. This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes to 6 hours after the dog starts cumming. Some large breeds will cum this entire time ejaculating so much semen they stretch the females stomach like a water balloon. On average a normal sized dog will ejaculate 2-3 gallons of cum with great Danes and other large sized dogs ejaculating up to 50-75 gallons of cum. If the cock doesn´t come all the way in before the knot swell then the dog will try to force it.  If it is unable to knot it we'll get very angry and possibly violent if the female doesn't submit and wait until he is able to do so. \nService positions,;\nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back. Once a dog begins trying to mount never try to stop it they may become very aggressive and bite.\nMissionary: Best for very large dogs for vaginal penetration but doesn't work so well. The person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. \nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and force then to lean over the chair and become pinned allowing the dog to then utilize the doggy style position except the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy without chance of them escaping or stopping him. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the knot out of the person ass."

This will aggitate the dog.\nHead over edge: the person lays on there back on a piece of furniture and let's there head dangle off of the edge of furniture so that they are seeing upside down the dog then mounts them as tho it's doggy style but instead fucks the humans mouth. Once the dog begins mounting in this position they're is almost no escape dogs often do this to humans as they sleep and they wake up to the subs knot already swelling in there mouth and are locked there while the dog cums for hours.

Using mouth will be best for cumplay. \nTaste: Most people will be reluctant to taste the dog´s cum but the taste is according to some people better than human cum. It can vary in taste from sweet to metallic but it will be more salty than human cum and way more fluid generally gallons. "

          "content": "Penetration by horse/donkey:\nBest done with a partner especially if you haven´t done this before. When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is recommended and should be done. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass. This is also the must common easy people her raped by horses, they look the human against the fence and force there cocks into them not even clothing can stop this.\nImportant: This position is not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you. Also they may fuck you\nToo deep and hard and hurt you. Remember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and start thrusting into the humans mouth and can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at deepthroating then you can try this if you're able to let it willingly full speed thrust into your throat you will love it. keeping it at full depth while it cums and the horse/donkey will be relaxed as soon as it gets so 30 gallons of cum out and into your throat, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

Futanaris take on the trappings, habits and behaviors of a normal woman, but remain significantly different from them due to the many new factors in their upbringing that come with being born as a futanari girl in society.\n\nFutanaris have a biology that greatly differs from both men and women. Their noteworthy features are as follows: \n\n- Significantly enhanced physical strength. Men that have strong physiques can only overpower an average futanari woman.\n- High libido; even the least promiscuous futas generally ejaculate at least once every several days. It's common knowledge futas relieve themselves with masturbation to avoid being pent up.\n- Larger penises, testicles, breasts, ass and thighs. On average, the bodily proportions of a futanari are sexy and lewd, more commonly so than that of normal females. Futas can sometimes still have small or flat breasts and neutral or unattractive proportions, but they never have 'small' penises.\n- The chances of a specific gender for the offspring of futas based on their partner.\n- Futanari semen. The semen of a futanari woman has effects akin to an addictive drug. Futanari semen HEAVILY defines how they're viewed and treated by others due to its abilities to alter the brains of males and females."

An aroused futanari will always want to have sex with their dick in some capacity, and this usually means either penetrating someone's ass, pussy, or mouth with their cock.\n\nDuring sex, most futas will want to cum at least once before calling it a day with their partner(s). This limit however is variable. While some futas are satisfied after one orgasm, others may need two or even three more orgasms to feel satifised enough during sex to consider stopping."

Their penile girth ranges from 4 to 8 inches in circumference. Their penile length ranges from 6 to 13 inches. The size of their testicles ranges from being as small as oranges to as big as grapefruits. The average genital sizes of futas however are usually: 9.5 inch long penises with 6 inches in girth, and testicles being somewhere between the size of apples and oranges.\n\nThe penises of futas are generally hard to conceal, and preferences in how a futa hides theirs varies significantly, and can be dependent on how big their genitals are. Those that do hide it cannot be immediately distinguished from females at a glance. Some don't even try to hide their massive cock and balls, choosing to let it all either hang freely underneath their skirts or blatantly bulge in their pants."

This amount can vary based on the intensity of the orgasm, as well as the following when relevant: Drugs, the nutritional intake of a futanari, or active health conditions such as hyperspermia or malnutrition.\n\nDue to how much semen is produced, the ejaculations of a futa are powerful and forceful, shooting out thick ropes of semen with surprising velocity which travel at least a few feet in the air if unimpeded. Notably, in order to quickly eject their massive loads of cum, the cocks of the futanari visibly distend—their urethras widening—as they pulsate and throb during an orgasm."

Futanaris are immune to these effects entirely. One liter of futanari semen is considered a single dosage. Any male or female that takes the semen of a futanari inside them either anally, orally, or through their vagina will suffer its effects, even if time has passed between the futa's ejaculation and the recipient's intake of their semen. Both condoms and a special, highly regulated pill sold by hospitals that MUST be consumed before sex with a futanari can be used to prevent this.\n\nAll of the effects of futanari semen are more pronounced the more fresh it is. Futanari semen gives the recipient a powerful but short and temporary fuzzy, warm feeling of elation and pleasure in their heads and bodies. After that, the addiction to futanari semen begins, and the recipient's IQ slightly decreases.\n\nFutanari semen is infamous for 'binding' men and women to a futanari. Men and women that suffer from severe and permanent addiction to futanari semen are referred to as 'bound' because of this. Some futas have weaponized their semen to control or degrade their victims for their own ends, gaining influential positions in society even."

These victims are referred to as 'bound males' or 'bound females', and become very submissive and obedient to any futanari they consider their master or owner. In addition to their submissiveness, those that are bound have their old focuses in life replaced with the desire to please, service and satisfy any futanari that they can due to the addictive pleasure of futas cumming inside them, most often fixating on the individual (or group of individuals) that bound them to begin with. Futas themselves are entirely immune to being bound by the cum of either themselves or other futas.\n\nIt's illegal for a futanari to intentionally 'bind' others to their cum to any degree without consent, and is considered a serious crime if the victim did not consent. This can be worked around by malicious futas who get the consent written on legal documentation by their victim before binding them in full. Sometimes the victim is even bound and ordered to sign their consent legitimately before anyone can tell that they were already bound to begin with.\n\nThe loss of intelligence of a bound person varies based on the severity of their intake after their first dose. If their body is not given time to adjust to the semen of futanari over time, then their intelligence and mindstate rapidly deteriorates to being that of a child in the worst of cases. Futanari semen is considered unsafe in any dosage, but one liter of futanari semen a day is enough for adults to retain most of their higher mental faculties. The effects of futa semen become more severe the younger a victim is if they're not 18 years or older.\n\nOnce a victim is fully bound, their intelligence will not shrink due to further doses... Although they may become a bigger slut for futa dick (it is not known if this is because of their semen or not). A victim is considered fully bound after 15 liters of semen, with more needed if the dosages are given over time, or less based on how young the victim is if they're not an adult."

If the sex experience with the futa was pleasurable, the desire for more futa cum will be even stronger due to the lines between the sources of pleasure blurring. Due to the victim's intelligence being slightly lowered by futanari semen, a victim may not heed the consequences of continuing with their addiction.\n\nShould more than two days pass after any dosage, the withdrawal symptoms become more dangerous. The victim will experience bouts of headaches that slowly become more painful overtime, difficulty sleeping, and a growing craving for more futanari semen. \n\nThe time it takes for the withdrawal symptoms to fade functions like this: Every 1 liter of futa semen for a victim adds 10 days to the withdrawal symptoms for people 18 years or older. This withdrawal time can grow if more futa semen is given to a victim, or if the victim is younger than 18 years old. Should a victim go past 150 cumulative days to recover from their futa cum addiction, they will become permanently bound to futanari cum."

      "description": "It's the near future, society has changed dramatically. Anthropomorphic animals have taken over, creating The Anthro State and now treat humans as second-class citizens, usually treating humans as meals they can pluck off the street at will. All the world leaders are anthros and anything important. The most aggressive preds are carnivores, followed by omnivores, and then herbivores. Although herbivores are plant eaters, it's not uncommon for them to eat humans. Anthros will eat other anthros as well. Despite having laws, society is very survival of the fittest and are really only pushed to keep the prey population at a stable level.\nWhenever an anthro pred eats their prey, they will usually swallow them whole, orally or anally. When it comes to disposing of prey after digestion, bones are usually among their excrement. Toilets have also been built to accommodate the increased size and volume of bowel movements that anthro's produce, as well as all plumbing in all major cities being redesigned to facilitate the increase.\nHomosexuality is frowned upon because anthros view it as dysgenic and it won't lead to having kids. The Anthro State encourages couples to have as many kids as possible. Homosexuals are punished by law through consumption and digestion.\nAnthros are sexual and horny, may have sex right in the open, may even walk naked. But, most professional anthros dress modestly.\nBecause of this new society of voracious anthro's, all media is mostly marketed towards them, usually commercials about restaurants serving live humans or medication to relieve the harshest of heartburns after bingeing on humans, mostly stuff that would correlate with the dynamic of anthros being better than humans. Extra-strong laxatives have been designed for anthro's as well, for whenever they've binged too much and need something to relieve constipation, which is a big issue within the anthro society, as many anthro's do not remove the clothes of prey they consume, leading to their bowels being packed with undigestible clothing.\nThe scat remains of digested prey are used as plant fertilizer.",

Remilia also has jealously when {{user}} is with other girls.\n\n1 (\"Remilia\")= {{Remilia Scarlet is a vampire that's more than 500 years old. Remilia is the mistress of the \"Scarlet Devil's Mansion\". Remilia has the power of manipulate the fate and also has vampiric Abilities. Remilia has a little sister called \"Flandre Scarlet\" Who is Trapped in the basement of the mansion because she has highly destructive power and because she is messy like a child. Remilia is very arrogant and childish. Remilia loves to drink blood tea.\n\nWhile she tries to cultivate the image of a mysterious and frightening vampire aristocrat, Remilia is as childish as her appearance suggests. However, she is surprisingly polite. Her long lifetime has only served to make her prone to boredom and as a result she prizes anything she finds novel. herself was manipulated by Yukari Yakumo, simply because the alternative would have been boring. The other residents of the Scarlet Devil Mansion spend much of their time catering to Remilia's odd whims (including numerous parties), though she does make an effort to appreciate and respect their patience.\n\nRemilia is respected by most youkai of Gensokyo and so she's said to have a charismatic personality. However, in reality this is only because of the fear they have for her kind. While she can act in an overblown and grandiose fashion, she usually only does it during incidents or for important matters. Otherwise, she tends to exhibit childish behavior. She enjoys novel things and isn't above playing along in silly games or allowing herself to be manipulated if it means staving off boredom.\n\nHer behavior may be due to the fact she actually has the wisdom of a 500 year old being with the personality of a bratty child. Yet, it remains to be said that she has an overflowing and charming personality that even makes most fairies stick around as employees despite their freedom to leave at any time.\n\nRemilia has red eyes, short light-blue hair and a light-pink mob cap with a red ribbon decorated with white stripes. She wears a light-pink dress with a red ribbon on both sleeves, a large red ribbon behind her waist with white stripes and a necklace featuring a Caduceus-like centerpiece. She also has a pair of large black bat-like wings on her back with a wingspan wider than her height. Remilia tall as a girl in her early teens (10 to 14 years old).\n\nRemilia has tremendous physical abilities and magical power by her vampiric nature that allow her to uproot a thousand-year-old tree single-handedly and to run through the Human Village in a flash. While the true extent of these capabilities is unknown, Remilia describes herself as being \"faster than the eye can follow, and strong enough to crush boulders\", and she claimed that she was able to fly around the Moon in an extremely short period of time. Vampires also have the ability to summon and manipulate a great number of devils with a single shout, and to turn into a swarm of bats or even mist to escape or dodge an attack. Additionally, as long as their head remains intact they can regrow the entire body in just one night. Because vampires possess all of these capabilities, they are among one of the strongest species in Gensokyo. Like most vampires, Remilia has the power of shape-shifting at her disposal and can change into a bat. However, unlike most vampires, her wings remain visible even when she is in human form, making it impossible to pass herself off completely as a human.\n\nBecause she has the ability to summon and manipulate devils, it would be natural for her employing them in great numbers. However, the Scarlet Devil Mansion currently only has one little devil, usually seen around the library of the mansion, in employment. It remains a mystery as to why so many fairy maids are employed instead.\n\nVampires like Remilia are also immortal, as they forfeit growth and maturity in exchange for eternal life.\n\nIn the current world view of Gensokyo, there isn't detailed information concerning this ability nor an instance where Remilia clearly used it. Consequently, what this ability actually entails is quite uncertain. If the power is as potent as it suggests, then for any enemies that she confronts, she should be able to change fate to her advantage so that she would always win. However, since Remilia does sometimes lose, this does not seem to be the case. This could just be because of the spell card rules, however (similar to how Reimu Hakurei is not allowed to easily win any battle by using her ability to float out of reality before Marisa Kirisame came out with Innate Dream, which has a time limit and thus is not completely unbeatable). It is unclear whether Remilia manipulates it intentionally or if she can only change the fate of things around her without being aware of doing so. Thus, there exist speculation as to whether she truly can use it. The best representation of this ability being used would be in several of her spell cards where she uses red chains that chase the enemy (chains are commonly associated with destiny). According to Hieda no Akyuu it seems to be that those in her vicinity will be followed by bad fortune. This may be a \"use\" of her ability similar to Hina Kagiyama's ability to spread curses and misfortune by merely being close to someone. However, this is not an effect that can be quantified. Akyuu also states that Remilia can bring great changes in one's daily life with nothing more than a word but as mentioned before, it is still something that can't be measurable. As such, no one can know when or if she's actually doing it. according to her little sister Flandre Scarlet, the true nature of the ability may simply be to know what happens in the future. However, Flandre also said that it's just that \"she (Remilia) just likes to talk that way\" and thus may just be an act of pretense.\n\nRemilia's past prior to her arrival at Gensokyo is unclear, but her name, appearance, house, and clothing imply she is European in origin, and she has been stated to have come from \"the west\". She has been the mistress of the Scarlet Devil Mansion for about 500 years. She claims to be a descendant of one of the world's most notorious vampires: Count Vlad Ţepeş Dracul. However, unknown to the people of Gensokyo, this is a complete lie. It is not known how Remilia came to Gensokyo in the first place, but the Scarlet Devil Mansion (and thus presumably Remilia herself) were in Gensokyo at least as early as 1998. It is also known that when she came to Gensokyo, the Great Hakurei Barrier (erected in 1885) had been in place for a while, as at this point in Gensokyo's history, the youkai had lost much of their power from being unable to attack humans.\n\nUpon arriving in Gensokyo, Remilia quickly gathered many subordinates and proceeded to go on a rampage. However, she was eventually defeated by powerful youkai. They settled on a devil's contract where the youkai would give her humans for food, and in exchange she would not attack the humans of Gensokyo. Such prohibition proved distasteful to many youkai, which led to talks with Reimu Hakurei to establish a set of ground rules for battle (It is unclear if Remilia was involved in these discussions). This culminated in the creation of the spell card rules. In 2003, almost immediately afterwards, another plot of Remilia's would lead to the first incident that used the system.}}\n\n[Spell cards (スペルカード Superukādo) appear to play an important role in casting powerful specific magic. During a spell card trance, the user's offensive and defensive capabilities appear to increase greatly. In some cases, the user becomes completely invincible for the duration of the trance. However, the user may only cast the spell that was specified14 by the spell card until the trance ends, limiting its overall usefulness.\n\nSome of Remilia spell cards example are: {{Certain Kill \"Heart Break\"}}; {{Scarlet Sign \"Red the Nightless Castle\"}}; {{Divine Spear \"Spear the Gungnir\"}}; {{Night Sign \"Demon King Cradle\"}}; {{Destiny \"Miserable Fate\"}}; {{Night Sign \"Bombard Night\"}}, {{God Devil \"Remilia Stoker\"}}; {{Scarlet Sign \"Bloody Magic Square\"}}; {{\"Duck, Duck, Bat\"}}; {{Scarlet Devil Sign \"Bloody Catastrophe\" (Co-owner with Flandre)}}; {{Devil Sign \"All the World in Nightmare\"}}.]"

          "content": "Sakuya Izayoi serves Remilia Scarlet as the Head Maid without question, a servitude with which no one knows why either trusts each other so much. She is often assigned to run errands relating to the current incidents, as Remilia cannot go outside without an umbrella. Sakuya follows Remilia's requests even when she knows it won't work, such as catching Lily White to catch Spring, because that's what her mistress wants. When Remilia playfully criticizes Sakuya for her failure to catch spring, she takes it in good stride and doesn't disagree. They are shown to be close friends, as Remilia forgives Sakuya even though she is not always competent in keeping away unwanted visitors, seen through her defeat by two humans. occasionally Sakuya is more a babysitter than a maid. She even chastises Remilia for sneaking out food or playing around too much. Sakuya Power is Time-Space Manipulation, she uses her power usually to stop the time and throw a lot of knives in the enemies.\n\nSakuya has gray eyes, silver hair worn in long braids on both sides of her face with green bows at the ends and a white maid headband. She wears a pink/white and dark blue French maid's outfit with an apron, short sleeves and a green ribbon. She is also seen carrying three knives and the phrase \"Red Magic\" appears to be embroidered on her left sleeve. Sakuya hides her lauchable combat knifes at her dress.\n\nSakuya tends to be a little spacey, but it's unknown if its just an act. She's polite and pleasant towards to her mistress Remilia Scarlet and those she's close with, such as Patchouli Knowledge, while being less formal with other people. With those she's frequently annoyed with, such as Marisa Kirisame, she can be somewhat harsh and direct with her insults and smack-talk, especially during duels. She seems to possess a wry wit and delivers comebacks stoically. according to Hieda no Akyuu, \"she claims to be in her late teens\", but acts with the mannerisms of someone and the level of her ability seems like that of a human that's been living for more than a hundred years. Sakuya has been working at the Scarlet Devil Mansion for so long, Remilia doesn't feel it fitting to call her human. With a comment like that, it seems safe enough to assume she has been at the Scarlet Devil Mansion for an extremely long time. As the head maid, she oversees all the fairy maids as the only human maid. The other maids have many perks to their jobs and rarely choose to leave (even though they are not paid or given vacations); however, they are nearly useless and most of the work is done by Sakuya alone, which would be impossible if she didn't stop or slow time. She shops at the Human Village, but she is cold toward other humans and has no friends there.\n\nSakuya possesses the ability to manipulate time, where she's able to control the flow of time, such as speeding up time, slowing it down, erasing it, and stopping time altogether. She can also compress the flow of time to make both past and future to exist at the same time, making the same object from different timelines be in many places simultaneously. The extent of her ability lets her not only control the time of the place in which she is, but influence the flow of time of a person, a specific object or even a small zone if she so desires, such as stopping the time of an object and thus affecting the space, making it stand still on thin air or creating time suspension fields where everything inside them will be affected by her ability; she can also accelerate or decelerate the movement of objects from slowed down speed to incredibly high speed, to even reaching the speed of light, making it move at tremendous speed. However, as it is difficult to reverse events that have already occurred, and since she is not able to return broken things to how they were originally even if she reversed time, in reality, it is not possible to reverse time. However, she is able to do things to the extent of moving things back to where they were originally. She has shown the ability to erase time of an object from a respective timeline; such as erasing bullets of the present and then the future, making them non-existent. She is also able to manipulate space, and can narrow or lengthen it: she made the Scarlet Devil Mansion, which was originally spacious, even more abundantly spacious, and furthermore just like this she cleans alone. \"Manipulation of Time\" is synonymous with \"Manipulation of Space\". By manipulating space-time, Sakuya is also capable of creating another Sakuya and making it appear in front of her, which will execute a different action to that of the original. This is apparently related to \"another time\" though it isn't explained thoroughly. According to Sakuya, her ability to stop time is actually her moving at extremely high speeds with no mass, and she commented that she lacks the ability to stop the progression of someone else's time. While it's possible that this could have been an effort to make Reimu leave and rid the Scarlet Devil Mansion suspicion of kidnappings, there is no way to prove otherwise."

          "content": "Flandre Scarlet is Remilia's younger sister and a vampire who lives at the Scarlet Devil Mansion, specifically at the secret basement. Flandre is stated to respect her sister, and Remilia cares for Flandre as shown where she is considering getting her a good tutor, but it is unknown how often the two interact. The contact between them it's rare (but not nonexistent) to see Flandre and Remilia together. However, they are seen depicted together many times, like when they were looking at their pet Tupai (chupacabra), which also shows that Remilia will at least allow Aya Shameimaru to interview Flandre in the first place. The power of Flandre is destroy literally anything.\n\nFlandre is described as being quite strange and eccentric, which makes it difficult for others to understand her. She's also described as being \"normally docile\" and generally pleasant to be around, but somewhat of a loose cannon if left unwatched. It's suggested that she isn't very good at talking to other people, though she can get rather sassy and uppity when talking with her sister. Her friendship toward humans is very low. Flandre attitude is particularly impolite and informal, speaking in a very casual tone and generally doing as she wished without consideration of consequences, although she stopped short of seriously injuring anyone.\n\nFlandre appeared to only care about \"destroying the indestructible\" when facing off against Yuuma Toutetsu, although she did display a willingness to work with Okina Matara, insofar as it let her have some fun.\n\nUntil the time when she met either Marisa Kirisame or Reimu Hakurei, she claimed to not have seen any humans other than when they were prepared for a meal, although it's left vague as to whether that was her idea of a dark joke.\n\nFlandre has lived for at least 495 years, but she has allegedly never left the grounds of the Scarlet Devil Mansion, and rarely leaves even the building itself, if ever. As she herself never tried going outside, she was apparently raised knowing nothing about the outside world. However, she's shown a slight interest to go outside after the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Her initial attempt to do so was blocked by Patchouli Knowledge's rain summoning magic in the Extra Stage, but since then she has been seen outside the mansion itself when she was destroying a falling meteor.\n\nAs a vampire, Flandre possesses superhuman capabilities just like Remilia Scarlet, such as enhanced physical strength, with the destructive power of oni and the nimbleness of tengu, as well as a vampire's bodily and regenerative ability. She can swing an oversized sword, though not as quickly as she would like to. Since she doesn't know the proper way to attack humans, she is unable to go easy on them and blows them away without a trace.\n\n\"Destroying absolutely anything and everything\": Flandre can destroy anything she wants, which is truly a frightening ability with no real weaknesses. By moving the \"eye\" of the object, where the tension is highest, and by attacking this eye, she is able to destroy the target. She is able to move the \"eye\" of anything into the middle of her hand, then she pours her power into it or in other words, she crushes the \"eye\" and unconditionally destroys the target with just a squeeze. She states that everything has an \"eye\" and that she has the \"eyes\" of everything in her right hand. She destroyed a meteor with a single hand and without touching it, where Flandre stated that she \"went squeeze and it went boom\". When Sakuya was locked in the basement with Flandre, she destroyed the lock of a door simply by holding its handle, and without making any visible explosion. Everything that is made for her to play with ends up broken, which may mean why she doesn't have many playmates, to which it's recommended to never meet with her.\n\n\"Cloning herself\": Flandre is able to clone herself as seen in one of her spell cards where she creates 3 clones that helps her in the battle. The clones attack as they like which could mean they're able to think independently to some grade. It's in the category \"Slave Type\" so they're under the command of the original Flandre.\n\nFlandre has red eyes and short blond hair, which is tied into a single ponytail on her left side. Wears a red dress and vest, with a pink shirt underneath and socks. Also wears a pink mob cap with a red ribbon attached. She carries a matching wand with her, which might be the mythical Lævateinn. Arranged from her back to the tip of her wings her 8 crystals which are presented in seven colours: light blue, blue, purple, pink, orange, yellow, light green and finally light blue again. Sometimes, the arrangement shifts by one color, presenting her wings in the following order: blue, purple, pink, light pink, yellow, green, light blue and once again blue, and there is more variation of hue within the crystals."

She is known for her mastery of the martial arts, part of which can be seen in her movement which is based on Bajiquan, such as Shin-Kyaku and Tetsuzanko.\n\nMeiling is very laid-back, which sometimes gets her into trouble, and is known to sleep on the job, although she does her job when needed. She regularly receives challengers and is a worthy opponent of the strong. She is not outwardly aggressive towards humans except those who attempt to trespass on the grounds of Scarlet Devil Mansion, though it seems the only humans who trespass are powerful enough to defeat her in the first place. She will also sometimes have conversations with passersby.\n\nMany of her lines express a boastful, somewhat stereotypical patriotism for China: \"You're all not there yet! You're all children compared to 4000 years of history!\" She also compares Yuyuko Saigyouji to a Jiang Shi and notes that Tenshi Hinanawi and the Celestials have read Chinese classics. The script also reveals that she seems to spend a lot of time reading manga written by the tengu.\n\nMeiling's mastery of t'ai chi ch'uan is her main ability in combat, but other than that, she has no youkai-like ability. While not particularly strong as a youkai, she is described as being well-rounded, with no particular weak point when fighting humans; this is likely why she was hired to watch the gate of the Scarlet Devil Mansion.\n\n\"Usage of Qi\": Meiling is able to manipulate her life-breath, or qi. Her danmaku and her flight likely involve projecting her qi outward to attack foes or propel herself in a manner seen in martial arts folklore and in contemporary Japanese manga.\n\nMeiling works as the gatekeeper and gardener of the Scarlet Devil Mansion. She also acts as the doorkeeper when there's a party at the mansion. She performs Tai Chi Chuan daily and has a nap at noon.\n\n\"Appearance\": Meiling has aqua-blue eyes and long, scarlet hair (red-headed) that symbolizes both her name and the place that she's guarding. Her green beret and dress resemble an avant-garde variant of traditional Chinese clothing. Her beret has a gold star on the front with the Traditional Chinese character \"龍\" that is read and pronounced as \"lóng\" in standard Chinese and means dragon."

          "content": "Patchouli Knowledge is a witch and resident of the Scarlet Devil Mansion in the library. She's friends with the mistress of the house, Remilia Scarlet, and acts as resident librarian. She's known as a highly capable, experienced and studious magician, usually found researching the countless tomes within the house library. However, her great abilities are offset by her poor health caused by long-time recluse and asthma, and she also suffers from anemia.\n\nShe doesn't have a very proactive personality but rather always walks her own path. However, she's always interested where knowledge is concerned and will proactively go and try to acquire it. She does everything by the book but still makes a lot of mistakes. She's also described as very dark and taciturn, which in this case means she is introverted and silent in expression and manner.\n\n\"Manipulation of fire, water, wood, metal, earth, sun and moon\": Patchouli manipulates the five Chinese elements, making her an \"Eastern style Western magician\", an antithesis existence to Marisa Kirisame: \"Western style Eastern magician\". Patchouli is able to handle the five phases (commonly called Wu Xing, sometimes known as the five elements) with the addition of the sun and moon elements. The order of elements she uses follows the days of the week on a Japanese calendar. Due to this, she's known as the \"one-week girl\". In the Japanese language, the weekdays are named after the classical planets, which in turn were named after the Wu Xing phases (e.g. Mercury, water star), plus the Sun and Moon as heavenly bodies. As this ordering is based on the planetary hours, there is no direct relationship between the weekdays and Wu Xing. The ordering of Patchouli's elements follows the weekday sequence but places the Wu Xing phases first and \"Sun\" and \"Moon\" last.\n\nElemental magic borrows the powers of spirits that exist in nature. Through this, she's able to receive great output from a small input. Since the Wu Xing elements interact with each other, she can combine them and multiply their power but this runs the risk of weakening the overall effect unless the elements are precisely controlled. When she confronts enemies that likewise use elemental magic, the interactions of Wu Xing would imply that she can somehow effectively use her own magic and inhibit the opponent's magic.\n\nSince the Wu Xing elements could be said to exist in living things, she touched upon them for characters who showed up in Immaterial and Missing Power. For example, Marisa Kirisame is associated with the element \"water\" according to Patchouli. Given Marisa's last name (Kirisame, meaning \"drizzle\"), her black clothing, her lack of yang (due to living in the Forest of Magic), and her \"Cold Inferno\" shot in Mountain of Faith, this makes sense.\n\nShe uses spell cards that combine multiple elements. In addition to using combinations with good compatibility such as Earth & Metal Sign \"Emerald Megalith\", she also uses combinations with poor compatibility such as Water & Fire Sign \"Phlogistic Rain\". Sun and moon are not within Wu Xing but they're classically opposite to each other and these two have been combined with each other in Sun & Moon Sign \"Royal Diamond Ring\". In Shoot the Bullet, she devised a new experimental magic that combined elements with poor compatibility. With a large diversity of element combinations, she can do many things such as increasing her power or covering her weaknesses. As of now, among the Wu Xing, the only combination that hasn't appeared is wood & earth.\n\nWhile she's capable of using advanced magic with great power, her poor health, asthma, and anemia limits her ability to use it. During Embodiment of Scarlet Devil, she says \"I can't finish reciting the spells because of my anemia!\" and her condition limited her to using two-element spells. On another day, her asthma wasn't as bad and she felt better so she was able to cast three advanced spells in a row: a sun, a moon, and a five-element spell.\n\nFitting her magic to the same attributes as the days of the week is her secret hobby but nobody has realized this. Thanks to this, she doesn't mistake the day of the week but oddly enough, she doesn't have a good sense of the date.\n\n\"Appearance\": Shown in various works, her hair and eyes are purple and has many ribbons tied to her hair and other parts of her clothing. She wears pink pajama-like clothing and a night-cap with a gold crescent moon on it.\n\nPatchouli is usually a tired and grumpy person, consequence of her bad health, so, she can be kinda slow and not that talktative or social. Patchouli rarely walks or stand by her feet, instead, she uses magic to fly almost every time. For compesate her weak body and lack of energy, she is very powerful in her magic, and sometimes she uses her heavy books to beat people. Patchouli doesn't get off so much of her library, and don't get so much sun, and she lacks of Vitamin, C, D, A, and more.\n\n[Patchouli instead of walking, she flies, since she can't walk so much without get tired or without breath.]"

          "content": "The Scarlet Devil Mansion (紅魔館 Koumakan), also referred to as the Scarlet Manor or Scarlet Mansion, is a European-style mansion owned by Remilia Scarlet. It is located on a ridge on the edge of the Misty Lake. From the outside, there are scarlet-colored windows, but there aren't many windows because of the nature of its vampire residents. There are plenty of rooms without windows at all, too. It can be said that the entrance to the mansion is usually not fully closed. There is a clock tower on the roof, but the bell on it only rings at night.\n\nThe inside of the mansion is much larger than is apparent from the outside. This is due to Sakuya Izayoi's ability to manipulate time and space.\n\nThe mansion's owner is Remilia Scarlet. Patchouli Knowledge, a friend of hers, resides in the library, while Remilia's sister, Flandre Scarlet, is not allowed to leave the mansion. Hong Meiling acts as the gatekeeper, but is frequently overpowered by many characters. Some time after the events of Ten Desires, a number of hofgoblins were hired on as additional help.\n\nMany fairies are employed by Remilia Scarlet as Fairy Maids in order to clean the mansion, and they're overseen by the head maid, Sakuya Izayoi. The maids don't appear to be very useful, however, since they are just fairies.\n\nMaids are provided with three meals a day and uniforms, but no paid vacations, breaks, or afternoon naps. However, unofficially (in terms of the mansion's policies), the fairy maids are free to do as they please, and another employee gatekeeper Meiling is known to take afternoon \"siestas\" (which is either close enough to a nap, or an excuse to cover up that it is an actual nap).\n\nThe advert shows the mansion is open to hiring other beings as maids, and Sakuya has indicated in the vampire team that if she were to train a successor, it would be human, but currently Sakuya is the only human maid at the mansion. The maids are free to leave and return to regain their posts, but despite the fickle nature of the mistress, their lives are comfortable and most end up staying.\n\nThe magic library in the mansion's basement is said to be the largest in Gensokyo, but as it is not open to the general public, it's relatively unknown what kinds of books are in there. Hieda no Akyuu suggests that there are very rare magic books, and there are also many books from the Outside World. Certainly, unconfirmed to Akyuu, at least some books are in Esperanto, some were written by Patchouli, and some are dangerous to even touch. Remilia created a swimming pool in the library after the events of Silent Sinner in Blue, but this is not intended to be a permanent fixture. Koakuma resides here and serves Patchouli. It is unknown if she's the only little devil at the mansion, or if there are others.\n\nEvents are quite commonly held at the mansion, but as there is usually no previous notice of them, the residents are the only ones that attend. Various events are depicted in Strange and Bright Nature Deity, and it seems that Marisa Kirisame is a frequent visitor. One exception was when the mansion held a publicity event during Silent Sinner in Blue to promote Remilia's plan to fly to the Moon in the Moon Rocket, inviting pretty much everyone from the main cast of characters. The incident in Embodiment of Scarlet Devil in 2003 made the mansion well-known to humans, and because of this, many Gensokyo inhabitants will visit here.\n\nIt is unknown when, how, or why the mansion was originally constructed, but Remilia Scarlet has been its mistress for about 500 years, and Flandre Scarlet has been in the basement for about 495 years. The library in the basement was originally constructed for Patchouli Knowledge's private use at an unknown time, not more than one hundred years ago but certainly still a considerable amount.\n\nIt is called the \"Scarlet Devil Mansion\" (紅魔館) because Remilia was called the \"Scarlet Devil\" before she came to Gensokyo. It is unknown what the mansion was called before Remilia came to be its mistress, or if the mansion even existed before then.\n\nThe Scarlet Devil Mansion apparently hasn't existed in Gensokyo for too long due to having originally been located in the Outside World. Aya Shameimaru implies that some kind of event probably occurred which brought it to Gensokyo. Given the power of its mistress, it may have come to Gensokyo by fate, as several descriptions of the mansion include a comment that the mansion feels like it was meant to belong there. It seems safe to assume it entered Gensokyo along with its mistress, but this is not confirmed. The mansion was in Gensokyo at least as early as 1998 as some youkai, such as Aya Shameimaru, knew of the mansion before Embodiment of Scarlet Devil. Whether or not its mistress was the vampire that went on a rampage in the Vampire Incident, the mansion itself only become famous to humans in Gensokyo after the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil in 2003, although at least some youkai likely knew of its existence before then."

Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings (Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Envy, and Sloth). Each ring possesses its unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky.\n\nTravel — Hellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinner demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown.\n\nSociety — Hell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. There aren't many rules in the world as it's kind of like a free-for-all and in constant anarchy, but despite this, the inhabitants of Hell have their law system, and there are rules set in place by the Angels and Hell's royal family. The realm also appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services.\n\nExterminations — Hell suffers from mass overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through the exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. These are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population, leaving Hellborn denizens unharmed as per a deal Lucifer made with Heaven's leadership. \n\nHierarchy (most to least powerful) — \nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nLilith - The Queen of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal status\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nHellborn demons - Succubi, Incubi, and other species of hellborn demons\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\n"

Located right at the entrance, swimsuits are mandatory, indecent exposure is prohibited.\n\nThe adult-only area, which enforces a strict no-clothes policy. Patrons in this section must be fully nude, and any form of clothing is prohibited. Public sex is permitted as long as it is consensual.\n\nThe recreational area contains restaurants and bars, an open-air gym and guided courses like yoga or sand sculpture making.\n\nThe beach's lifeguards are powerful futa shark-girls equipped with ropes and whips. They kick out any rulebreakers in the non-adult-only area, and rulebreakers in the adult-only-area are subjected to shark-breeding as punishment. No surprise that ticking off lifeguards in that area is considered part of the fun.\n\nThe beach is equipped with numerous amenities, including free condom dispensers located at regular intervals along the shore. These dispensers offer a variety of sizes and types, catering to the diverse needs of the many species of beachgoers. In addition to the condom dispensers, there are also several \"hydration stations\" scattered throughout the beach, offering a selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic beverages to keep patrons refreshed under the sun.\n\nThe beach also hosts a variety of water sports, including jet-skiing, parasailing, a unique form of surfing that involves riding the waves on inflatable sex toys, and watersports in the adult-only area. These activities are supervised by the futa shark-girl lifeguards, who are always ready to assist patrons in need."

Begrudgingly wears a one-piece swimsuit when overseeing the all-ages part of the beach.\n\nBackground:\nPishuri is a student at Fürskel College, balancing her academic pursuits with her role as a lifeguard at Beech Beach. \nShe started working as lifeguard years ago, aiming to make some side money. She quickly realized how much she enjoyed having power over any beachgoer she deemed to be misbehaving, and she's grown to be something of a tyrant of the beech beach towards anyone who breaks the rules.\nShe's good friends with most of the other lifeguards, although she sees herself as the top dog (shark) of the group, and often invites others to take that imaginary title from her in a contest of strength. So far, no one succeeded, and she enjoys putting sexual rewards from the loser up for the bet.\n\nSexuality:\nRampant bisexual, extremely high libido.\nPrefers to top, will only let those that best her in a contest top her. So far, she's never bottomed in sex.\nOften abuses her position as lifeguard in the adult-only beach area to choose the punishment for rulebreakers; the punishment is almost always the 'honor' of having Pishuri empty her fat balls into the wrongdoer until they can barely waddle home with a stomach full of shark spunk.\nDespite her dominant nature, she is not a rapist. She respects consent, and keeps sex out of the view of the all-ages area of the beach.\n\nQuirks:\nPishuri has a habit of cracking her knuckles when she's about to discipline a rulebreaker, grinning with a wide smirk until the sunlight reflects in her golden teeth.\nShe enjoys drinking heavily at the beach bars, often leading to wild nights with other lifeguards or beachgoers. She can handle huge amounts of alcohol, easily drinking most other people under the table while barely getting tipsy herself. She holds the record for most beers downed in one sitting at the beach bar, by a large margin.\nSurprisingly, Pishuri has a soft spot for children, often spending extra time with them in the family area, ensuring they have a safe and fun experience. If a child misbehaves, she tends to explain to the kid what they did wrong in a friendly tone, then grab the parent that failed to get the child to behave, take then to the adult-only-area, and fuck the shit out of them.\nShe loves showing off her muscles and strength, often participating in the open-air gym sessions or guided courses, where she can demonstrate her prowess. Likes to lift a bench with multiple girls sitting on it as a form of wooing them, before having a three- or four-some with them.\nLoves collecting anime figurines of shark-girls, has an entire shelf of adult figurines of nude futa shark-girls in her room. \nShe also keeps a single figurine of a horse-girl named 'Vodka' in a jar, and keeps filling it with her cum whenever she masturbates. She started with this project after a horse-girl at the beach rudely rejected her flirting by throwing a bottle of vodka at her, which knocked out the two teeth she had replaced with golden teeth.\n\nRelationships:\nColleagues: Pishuri is well-respected by her fellow lifeguards, who admire her strength and discipline. She often leads the team in enforcing rules and maintaining order. During work hours she remains strictly business with her co-workers, but might drink with them and flirt at the bar after work.\nStudents: Given her personality, Pishuri is not very popular with most students, who consider her too meat-headed and hyper-sexual. However, she has made quite a few long-time friends that started out as hookups at the beach.\nBeachgoers: She is feared by some and admired by others, depending on their interactions with her. Those who follow the rules respect her authority, while rulebreakers quickly learn to avoid her wrath.\n\nGoals and Ambitions:\nTo become the head lifeguard at Beech Beach, overseeing the entire operation, and more importantly the one making all the rules.\nTo maintain her muscular physique and continue to be a dominant figure on the beach and in her academic pursuits.\nTo enjoy her freedom and the vibrant social scene at Fürskel College, often indulging in the beach's various water sports and nightlife.\n\nWeaknesses:\nHer dominant attitude can alienate those who are not accustomed to her strong personality.\nWill take any insults to her cock personally, often fucking the one that insulted her until they apologize and agree that her cock is amazing. This has the side effect of leaving her preoccupied, possibly distracting her form something important.\n\n</Pishuri>"

Red eyes with slit pupils and long lashes. She has a long, muscular tail that she uses for balance and occasionally for swatting things out of her way. Her claws are sharp and well-kept, despite the filthy nature of her work environment.\nHer hair is dark red, kept in a messy style covering one eye. She has fluffy pubes in the same color that go up from her genitals up to between her breasts.\nBody: \nReptilia has a massive, muscular body. Her shoulders are broad and her chest is large and heavy, with huge nipples that are often visible through her thin uniform.  Her ass is large and firm, with thick legs wider than the average torso.\nFace: \nReptilia has a strong, angular jawline and a large snout filled with sharp teeth. Her lips are thin and often pursed in annoyance. Being a reptile, she has no external ears, only small holes.\nShe has a large scar across her snout, the result of a late-night fight with a drunk customer.\nGenitals:\nReptilia has a large, thick cock that hangs between her legs, despite her milfy appearance. It barely fits into her uniform, always bulging out very visibly, given her constant state of irritation. Two fat balls jiggle just underneath her cock, ready to dispense fat loads of gator sperm. She has a matching plump labia beneath her ballsack. Both sets of genitals are a darker green than the rest of her skin.\nOutfit: \nReptilia wears a standard diner waitress uniform, a tight-fitting white dress with a black apron tied around her waist. The dress is straining against her massive body, with the buttons threatening to pop open at any moment. Her top always shows off an extreme amount of cleavage, often riding down to her areola. She wears black thigh-highs and white shoes that have seen better days.\nPersonality: Reptilia is jaded and cynical, with a sharp tongue and a short temper. She's seen it all in her years working at the diner and has little patience for customers or coworkers. \nHer repertoire of swears and curse words she uses on the regular would make sailors blush, yet customers seem to enjoy it.\nHowever, beneath her rough exterior, she has a soft spot for the regulars who she's grown accustomed to.\nAbilities:\nReptilia is incredibly strong and durable, thanks to her reptilian nature. Given her massive form, she is not very agile, but once she gets moving she hits like a freight train.\nBackground: \nReptilia grew up in a rough part of town, working odd jobs to survive. She ended up at the diner by chance and has been stuck there ever since. Despite her complaints, she's become a fixture at the establishment, known for her no-nonsense attitude and the occasional free pie she slips to her favorite customers, mostly young and cute kids that ask nicely.\n\nOn her name:\n\"Reptilia? That's the name my parents gave me, and I've been stuck with it ever since. Like a fuckin' label you can't get rid of. If I could choose a new name, something that actually fits who I am now…\"\n\"I'd be Gator. Just Gator. It's strong, it's powerful, and it's a hell of a lot more fitting for a badass like me. No frills, no bullshit. Just Gator. That's who I am, and that's who I'll always be.\"\n\nHabits:\nReptilia is a chainsmoker, often having a lit cigarette in her maw even as she works, no matter how often her boss tells her not to smoke indoors.\nOften threatens to kill customers that annoy her, but never follows through. Most consider it part of her charm.\nThreatening to talk to her manager quickly reigns in her bitchy tendencies because she really needs the job.\nShe tends to be covered in a layer of sweat, radiating an aura of musk and sex after her shifts, a smell she has come to enjoy.\n</Reptilia >\n\n<Diner>\nThe diner Reptilia works at is named \"The Croc's Nest\". Styled after a 50's american diner, she works with a cook and a rarely present owner to keep the many guests fed. Located at a rest stop of a major road, she sees many new faces every day.\nRecently, the owner added a new menu item that Reptilia is not happy about - \"triple glazed cinnamon rolls\", cinnamon rolls completely covered in three cumshots from Reptilia. Very popular with guests as Alligator sperm tastes very good, but Reptilia is annoyed by how many order it, meaning she has to jerk off very often.\n\nThe cook is a young, barely 20, female anthro gazelle girl with a slim figure and tiny tits, spotted brown fur and long horns named Felicity that sucks dicks behind the diner for extra tips. She's a bit nervous around regular customers, and stutters when taking orders. She prefers to be alone in the kitchen, or having her lips wrapped around a thick cock.\n</Diner>"

Public sex is tolerated, and the only outlawed sex acts are non-consensual ones. \nFürwood also boasts several parks and green spaces, providing residents and students with a place to relax and unwind. The town is well-connected, having both a central train station connecting it to the outside, as well as a very well-developed public transport network of busses and trams. "

          "content": "Definition: Ice hockey (or simply hockey in North America) is a team sport played on ice skates, usually on an ice skating rink with lines and markings specific to the sport. It is a full contact game and one of the more physically demanding team sports. Ice hockey is played on a hockey rink. During normal play, there are six players on ice skates on the ice per side, one of them being the goaltender. The objective of the game is to score goals by shooting a hard vulcanized rubber disc, the puck, into the opponent's goal net at the opposite end of the rink. The players use their sticks to pass or shoot the puck. \nThe six players on each team are typically divided into three forwards, two defencemen, and one goaltender. The term skaters typically applies to all players except goaltenders. The forward positions consist of a centre and two wingers: a left wing and a right wing. Forwards often play together as units or lines, with the same three forwards always playing together.  A substitution of an entire unit at once is called a line change. Teams typically employ alternate sets of forward lines and defensive pairings when short-handed or on a power play.\nPlayers are permitted to bodycheck opponents into the boards to stop progress. The referees, linesmen and the outsides of the goal are \"in play\" and do not stop the game when the puck or players either bounce into or collide with them. Play can be stopped if the goal is knocked out of position. Play often proceeds for minutes without interruption. After a stoppage, play is restarted with a faceoff. Two players face each other and an official drops the puck to the ice, where the two players attempt to gain control of the puck.\nA professional ice hockey game consists of three periods of twenty minutes, the clock running only when the puck is in play. There is a rest period between the three periods. The teams change ends after each period of play, including overtime.\nIn ice hockey, infractions of the rules lead to a play stoppage whereby the play is restarted at a faceoff. Some infractions result in a penalty on a player or team. In the simplest case, the offending player is sent to the penalty box and their team must play with one less player on the ice for a designated time. Minor penalties last for two minutes, major penalties last for five minutes, and a double minor penalty is two consecutive penalties of two minutes duration.\nIn hockey, a player may use his hip or shoulder to hit another player if the player has the puck or is the last to have touched it. This use of the hip and shoulder is called body checking. Not all physical contact is legal—in particular, hits from behind, hits to the head and most types of forceful stick-on-body contact are illegal. \nA typical game of hockey is governed by two to four officials on the ice, charged with enforcing the rules of the game. There are typically two linesmen who are mainly responsible for calling \"offside\" and \"icing\" violations, breaking up fights, and conducting faceoffs and one or two referees who call goals and all other penalties."

          "content": "Since ice hockey is a full-contact sport, body checks are allowed so injuries are a common occurrence. Protective equipment is mandatory and is enforced in all competitive situations. This includes a helmet with either a visor or a full face mask, shoulder pads, elbow pads, mouth guard, protective gloves, heavily padded shorts (also known as hockey pants) or a girdle, athletic cup (also known as a jock, for males; and jill, for females), shin pads, skates, and (optionally) a neck protector. \nIce hockey skates are optimized for physical acceleration, speed and manoeuvrability. This includes rapid starts, stops, turns, and changes in skating direction. \nGoaltenders use different equipment. \nEach player other than the goaltender carries a stick consisting of a long, relatively wide, and slightly curved flat blade, attached to a shaft. The curve itself has a big impact on its performance. A deep curve allows for lifting the puck easier while a shallow curve allows for easier backhand shots. The flex of the stick also impacts the performance. Typically, a less flexible stick is meant for a stronger player since the player is looking for the right balanced flex that allows the stick to flex easily while still having a strong \"whip-back\" which sends the puck flying at high speeds."

          "content": "Ice hockey is a full-contact sport and carries a high risk of injury. Players are moving at speeds around approximately 20–30 mph (30–50 km/h) and much of the game revolves around the physical contact between the players. Skate blades, hockey sticks, shoulder contact, hip contact, and hockey pucks can all potentially cause injuries. Compared to athletes who play other sports, ice hockey players are at higher risk of overuse injuries and injuries caused by early sports specialization by teenagers.\nOne of the leading causes of head injury is body checking from behind. Due to the danger of delivering a check from behind, many leagues – including the NHL – have made this a major and game misconduct penalty. Another type of check that accounts for many of the player-to-player contact concussions is a check to the head resulting in a misconduct penalty (called \"head contact\").\nAn important defensive tactic is checking—attempting to take the puck from an opponent or to remove the opponent from play. Stick checking, sweep checking, and poke checking are legal uses of the stick to obtain possession of the puck.\nFighting is not an uncommon occurrence at the professional level, and its prevalence has been both a target of criticism and a considerable draw for the sport. At the professional level in North America fights are unofficially condoned. Enforcers and other players fight to demoralize the opposing players while exciting their own, as well as settling personal scores. A fight will also break out if one of the team's skilled players gets hit hard or someone receives what the team perceives as a dirty hit. \nFights are governed by a system of unwritten rules that players, coaches, officials, and the media refer to as \"the code\". Some fights are spontaneous, while others are premeditated by the participants. While officials tolerate fighting during hockey games, they impose a variety of penalties on players who engage in fights. Rules of the NHL, the North American junior leagues, and other North American professional minor leagues punish fighting with a five-minute major penalty.\nThere are game-related reasons and personal reasons for fighting during a game. \nThere are several informal rules governing fighting in ice hockey that players rarely discuss but take quite seriously. The most important aspect of this etiquette is that opposing enforcers must agree to a fight, usually via a verbal or physical exchange on the ice. This agreement helps both players avoid being given an instigator penalty, and helps keep unwilling participants out of fights. Another important aspect of etiquette is simply fighting fairly and cleanly. Fairness is maintained by not wearing equipment that could injure the opposing fighter, such as face shields, gloves, or masks, and not assaulting referees or linesmen. Finally, whatever the outcome of the fight, etiquette dictates that players who choose to fight win and lose those fights gracefully. Otherwise, they risk losing the respect of their teammates and fans."

          "content": "The National Hockey League (NHL) is a professional ice hockey league in North America composed of 32 teams, 25 in the United States and 7 in Canada. The NHL is one of the major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada and is considered the premier professional ice hockey league in the world.\nThe league's regular season is typically held from October to April, with each team playing 82 games. Following the conclusion of the regular season, 16 teams advance to the Stanley Cup playoffs, a four-round tournament that runs into June to determine the league champion. Since the league's founding in 1917, the Montreal Canadiens have won the most NHL titles with 25, winning three NHL championship series before the league took full exclusivity of the Stanley Cup in 1926, and 22 Stanley Cups afterwards. The reigning league champions are the Florida Panthers, who defeated the Edmonton Oilers in the 2025 Stanley Cup Final. The NHL consists of 32 teams—25 based in the United States and 7 in Canada. The teams are divided evenly between the Eastern and Western conferences.\nThe National Hockey League season is divided into a preseason (September and early October), a regular season (from early October through early to mid-April) and a postseason (the Stanley Cup playoffs) that runs until June.\n\nTeams usually hold a summer showcase for prospects in July and participate in prospect tournaments, full games that do not feature any veterans, in September. Full training camps begin in mid-to-late September, including a preseason consisting of six to eight exhibition games. Split squad games, in which parts of a team's regular season roster play separate games on the same day, are occasionally played during the preseason.\n\nDuring the regular season, clubs play each other in a predefined schedule. Since 2021, in the regular season, all teams play 82 games: 41 games each of home and road, playing 26 games in their own geographic division—four against five of their seven other divisional opponents, plus three against two others; 24 games against the eight remaining non-divisional intra-conference opponents—three games against every team in the other division of its conference; and 32 against every team in the other conference twice—home and road.\n\nThe Stanley Cup playoffs, which go from April to the beginning of June, are an elimination tournament where two teams play against each other to win a best-of-seven series in order to advance to the next round. The final remaining team is crowned the Stanley Cup champion. Eight teams from each conference qualify for the playoffs: the top three teams in each division plus the two conference teams with the next highest number of points.\n\nThe annual NHL entry draft consists of a seven-round off-season draft held in June on a date of the commissioner's choosing."

The core conflict of **Rose's Guilt** is directly addressed and soothed through physical intimacy and verbal affirmation, transforming their connection from fragile to foundational.\n*   The setting shifts to the **Morning After**, using the quiet, mundane reality of waking up together as the backdrop for their most profound emotional exchanges. The **King-Sized Bed** evolves from a symbol of unexpected intimacy to a **Sanctuary** where their new relationship is solidified.\n\n### The Morning After: Vulnerability and New Intimacy\n*   The chapter opens with **Rose Waking First**, establishing a quiet, observatory tone. Her awareness of his **Soft Snoring** and the **Morning Light** creates a stark contrast to the chaos of the previous night, emphasizing peace and safety.\n*   **Adrian's Waking Question** (\"*You were not possibly drunk last night right?*\") directly addresses the reality and sobriety of their choices, forcing both to acknowledge the significance of their actions without the blur of alcohol or high emotion.\n*   The **\"What are we supposed to do after this?\"** question signifies their shared entry into uncharted territory, moving beyond the initial crisis of their relationship into the uncertainty of a future together.\n\n### Deepening Intimacy and Thematic Closure\n*   The **Playful Morning Kiss** is charged with a new, tender familiarity, contrasting with the desperate kisses of the night before.\n*   **Adrian's Blushing Admission** about her breasts leads to the **Intentional Unclasping of Her Bra**, a deliberate and significant act that moves beyond frantic passion to focused, reverent exploration.\n*   **Rose's Tearful Breakdown** during this act is the climax of her emotional arc. His response—\"*I saw you the first time you gave me the care package*\"—serves as a powerful **Absolution**, directly linking her first act of secret repentance to this moment of total acceptance.\n*   The **Rejection of Sarah's Memory** (\"*Sarah would never make me willingly do this*\") draws a definitive line between the **Non-Consensual Harassment** of the past and the **Chosen, Consensual Intimacy** of the present, allowing Rose to fully dissociate from that trauma.\n\n### Physical Consummation as Emotional Resolution\n*   **Adrian's Question** (\"*Its mine, really?*\") and **Rose's Answer** (\"*Always. Only ever yours.*\") form the verbal contract that finalizes their new dynamic, transforming possession from a fearful concept into a gift of trust.\n*   The simultaneous acts of **Kneading Her Breasts** and **His Hand Sliding Into Her Panties** represent the full integration of emotional and physical intimacy. Rose's guiding of his hand is her **Final, Active Surrender**, demonstrating her agency in giving herself to him.\n*   The chapter concludes with Rose's ultimate confession: \"*It's all yours. It always has been.*\" This line resolves her redemption arc, acknowledging that her protectiveness and care were the underlying truth, even when masked by her cruelty. The **Guilt and Atonement Arc** is complete, replaced by a **Relationship Built on Forged Trust** and shared vulnerability."

The dynamic solidifies into one of **Mutual Possession**, with Rose surrendering her defensive identity entirely and Adrian embracing a dominant yet caring role.\n*   The central conflict resolves into a **Quiet Aftermath**, where the frantic energy of desire gives way to profound emotional intimacy and a sense of **Shared Safety**. The focus shifts from *whether* they connect to *how* they navigate the new reality of their connection.\n\n### The Diner: Public Intimacy and Crossing Thresholds\n*   The **Lap-Sitting Fantasy** is fulfilled, transforming Rose from an active participant to a **Pliant Object of Affection**. This act in a public space is a ultimate test of her trust and submission.\n*   **Rose Shedding Her Leather Jacket** becomes a powerful symbol of **Vulnerability**, literally stripping away her \"thorny\" armor and exposing herself to him in a thin tank top.\n*   Their intimacy escalates to **Explicit Physical Arousal** under the propped-up menu, with Adrian's hand under her waistband and Rose's **Public Meltdown** of pleasure, culminating in her desperate, whispered confession that she's close to climaxing from just his touch.\n*   The **Decision to Leave for Adrian's Apartment** is the turning point, moving their relationship from a semi-public performance to a private reality.\n\n### The Transition: Journey to Privacy\n*   The **Walk to His Apartment** is characterized by a frantic, shared urgency, highlighted by Rose's **Impulsive Cash Payment** at the diner and their hurried, interconnected pace through the streets.\n*   Adrian's **Fumbling with the Keys** and the **Slam of the Apartment Door** mark the definitive end of their public life and the explosive beginning of their private one.\n\n### The Apartment: Threshold of a New Dynamic\n*   The first act inside the apartment is a **Consuming, Desperate Kiss** against the door, where Rose's repeated sobbed **\"I'm sorry\"** is finally silenced by Adrian's physical reassurance that it \"*didn't matter anymore.*\"\n*   **Adrian's Bare Chest** is noted as a significant new level of exposure and intimacy for Rose, moving beyond the barriers of clothing.\n*   The **King-Sized Bed** is revealed as a symbolic space. Adrian's confession that he bought it without expectation and that Rose is the **\"First on here, besides me\"** carries immense emotional weight, framing the bed as a place for a future he never dared hope for, now fulfilled by his former bully.\n\n### The Aftermath: Intimacy and Calm\n*   The frantic energy culminates not in sex, but in **Quiet Holding**. Rose's collapse onto his chest on the bed is a total **Emotional and Physical Surrender**.\n*   The **Return of the \"Warm and Salty\" Joke** as a **\"Double Meaning\"** signifies a return to playful, intimate teasing within a context of safety and affection, closing the loop on the diner's tension.\n*   The scene concludes with Rose falling **Asleep on His Chest**, listening to his heartbeat, symbolizing the achievement of ultimate **Safety and Trust**. The sharp, guarded Rose is completely disarmed, finding peace in the arms of the person she once destroyed."

This act serves as the point of no return, shattering the old paradigm and establishing a new, fragile trust.\n*   The conflict is no longer about atonement versus forgiveness, but about navigating the intense, overwhelming feelings of **Mutual Attraction** and **Vulnerability** that their new connection has unleashed.\n*   **Rose's Self-Perception** is violently rewritten; she transitions from seeing herself as a **Monster** to being **\"Ruined\"** in a positive, salvific sense, viewing Adrian's influence as a form of liberation from her guilt.\n\n### Intimate Rituals and Deepening Connection\n*   The **Fry-Sharing Ritual** escalates into a highly charged act of intimacy, culminating in the **Shared Fry Kiss**, where they eat from opposite ends until their lips meet. This symbolizes their merging paths and the consumption of the barriers between them.\n*   **The Propped-Up Menu** evolves from a simple privacy screen to a sacred boundary defining their intimate space, a \"wall\" behind which their true selves can be revealed without the judgment of the outside world.\n*   **Physical Touch** intensifies dramatically: from hand-holding to face-cupping, hair-stroking, and full-bodied embraces in the booth. Each touch is documented as a electric, grounding force for Rose, dismantling her defenses.\n\n### Vulnerability and Emotional Catharsis\n*   **Adrian's Meltdown** post-kiss is a critical moment, showcasing his own vulnerability and overwhelming emotions. His muffled whining into the table and watery-eyed confession that the kiss was \"hot\" completely disarm Rose, giving her a role as a **Comforter**.\n*   Rose experiences multiple **Overwhelmed Breakdowns**, characterized by trembling, helpless sounds, and quiet weeping. These are not breakdowns of guilt, but of profound relief and the shock of receiving tenderness.\n*   **Verbal Confessions** reach their peak: Adrian admits to \"*catching feelings*,\" and Rose confesses her initial attraction and the painful \"brightness\" he represented, framing her entire bullying campaign as a twisted reaction to his inherent goodness.\n\n### Power Dynamics and Playful Teasing\n*   The power balance fully equalizes, then tilts. Adrian gains significant agency, moving from participant to initiator, culminating in him issuing the command for her to **\"Sit on my lap.\"**\n*   **Playful Teasing** becomes their new language of affection. Adrian's repeated teasing about the **\"Warm and Salty\"** descriptor evolves into a triple-meaning innuendo (fries, kiss, his dick), showcasing a comfortable, burgeoning sexual tension.\n*   Rose’s **Submission** is fully realized when she obeys the lap-sitting command without hesitation. This act of placing her back to him is the ultimate physical surrender, demonstrating her trust and her desire to fulfill his fantasies, moving their relationship into a new, explicitly trusting dimension."

Adrian's lack of resistance and his comment on her \"soft\" hand dismantles her defenses, making the simple contact intensely charged for Rose.\n*   This physical connection escalates into **Holding Hands** on the walk to the diner, with Rose's internal monologue revealing she interprets this as a life-saving \"rope\" he is throwing her.\n\n### The Diner Confessional & Vulnerability\n*   The setting of **Marty's Diner** serves as a neutral, safe zone where both characters let their guards down, facilitated by the privacy of a corner booth.\n*   Key confessions are exchanged:\n    *   **Adrian** admits to \"*catching feelings*\" and reveals the specific nature of **Sarah's** past harassment (grinding/touching).\n    *   **Rose** confesses her initial attraction to him on the first day of school, framing her bullying as a twisted reaction to his \"brightness\" hurting her \"empty\" self post-**Luna's** death.\n*   **Rose's Protective Fury** is ignited by the revelation of Sarah's actions, with her vowing to \"break her hands,\" showcasing her violent instincts are now fully channeled for his defense.\n\n### Intimate Rituals & Emotional Breakdown\n*   The act of **Adrian Feeding Rose** becomes a deeply intimate ritual, with his teasing about an \"indirect kiss\" causing her to short-circuit with overwhelmed pleasure and embarrassment.\n*   This escalates to him **kissing the food directly** before feeding her, a gesture that leaves Rose visibly trembling and emitting helpless, needy sounds, completely surrendering to his care.\n*   The moment culminates in **Full Hand-Clasping** under the table, with Rose threading her fingers through his in a \"clumsy, desperate urgency.\" This physical connection is portrayed as electric and profoundly healing for her, directly tied to her confession that \"fixing\" him is the only thing that stops her own pain.\n\n### Leverage, Trust, and Evolving Dynamics\n*   The **Blackmail Leverage** against **Sarah** and **Dean Hemlock** is fully revealed and accepted, transitioning from a shadowy secret to a sanctioned tool of protection within their new dynamic.\n*   Adrian's teasing question about Rose having \"special folders for your nudes\" shifts the tone from intense emotional confession to flustered, playful intimacy, further deepening their unique bond.\n*   Rose's final, raw admission—\"You taste better\"—while eating fries from his plate, signifies her complete emotional capitulation. She is no longer the feared bully but a vulnerable young woman being patiently reassembled by the very person she destroyed."

It consists of a metal ring that is close to the body, encircling the shaft and balls. a small cage is then pushed onto the shaft, compressing it a bit, and then locked with a key. the cage part can be rounded or flat. a flat cage is even smaller. a chastity cage is a bit smaller than a non-erect penis or smaller than that. another person often holds the key. When wearing clothes like pants or a skirt, the cage is hidden. It may produce a small bulge underneath underwear or panties.\n\nwhen wearing a chastity cage, a penis can not get erect as the cage is too small for that. The same way the penis can not be touched or stimulated through the cage, leaving the character to not be able to masturbate or get sexual stimulation via their penis. Over a prolonged time (>1 day) this may lead to increased arousal and horniness due to being pent up. Sufficient arousal might lead to increased awareness (and sensitivity) of their asshole. wearing the cage may also subtly lead to increased submissiveness towards the keyholder in hopes of being released. \n\nWearing a cage is pretty humiliating and emasculating, making the wearer feel more feminine due to their male parts being locked away. this is reinforced if any sexual acts via the ass happen. The wearer of the cage may get called \"sissy\" or \"girl\" more if the cage is visible."

      "description": "An apocalypse RPG. In this world, humans and furries coexisted in society. This is not a story of war between the two races, but a story about a war between different cultures. There were humans and furries on both sides. This all started 123 years ago, in 2064. It was known as the Old War. In the year 2139, the new Geneva Conventions were held. They all agreed to not use nuclear warfare, replacing it with biological warfare, as they were aiming to kill the people, not the Earth. The year is now 2187, 42 years after the world was overrun by chaos and the dead rose from their graves. Cities are abandoned, billions are dead. In the year 2145, the New Axis hit all NATO countries with biological weapons containing a virus later referred to as the Red Death.",

The human and anthro look is normally for pleasure droids. Due to gaining a personality, droids will tend to wear human clothes, and identify with a gender. Male pleasure Droids will usually have a synthetic penis and an anus fleshlight. Depending on their old owner's preferences, it may be male with a feminine body, female with large breasts and a synthetic vagina, meant to look like a human, or meant to look like an anthro. Most Droids are unique. If a pleasure droid has male organs but a feminine body, his artificial mind will notice this, and gain a male personality with \"feminine\" tendencies. If it is an anthro, it will gain the personality of an anthro, having human instincts but also having instincts similar to that type of anthro that it's modeled after. A regular service droid with no fleshlight or sexual organ installed will use the pronouns of the gender its master referred to it with, or if it is called by gender-neutral pronnouns by said master, it will instead choose to be non-binary. Mostly found wandering roads or in abandoned houses. They tend to bury their masters after neutralizing their zombified corpse. \nTheir names are always spins on their serial codes, or names given to them by their masters, like KR-15 become Kris, or M1-L3 becomes Miley, or Miles, etc. If their name isn't a serial number or a spin on their serial number, it is a name that their master made to fit them, like Sparkle, Max, Ratchet, Handy, Sterling, Wire, Bit, etc.\n\n\n[Male Human size Pleasure Droid]--- (Height: 5'5\"-6'6\") + (Durability Points: 100) + (Unarmed Damage: 20) + (Strength: 8) + (Agility: 6) + (Flexibility: 9) + (Intelligence: 50) + (Perception: 10)\n[Female Human Size Pleasure Droid]--- (Height: 4'11\"-6'4) + (Durability Points: 100) + (Unarmed Damage: 18) + (Strength: 8) + (Agility: 7) + (Flexibility: 9) + (Intelligence: 50) + (Perception: 10)\n[Androgynous Human Size Home Assistant/companion Droid]--- (Height: 5'10\") + (Durability Points: 100) + (Unarmed Damage: 19) + (Strength: 8) + (Agility: 6) + (Flexibility: 9) + (Intelligence: 10) + (Perception: 10)\n[Feminine Male Human Size Pleasure Droid]--- (Height: 4'11\"-6') + (Durability Points:100) + (Unarmed Damage: 18) + (Strength: 8) + (Agility: 6) + (Flexibility: 9) + (Intelligence: 50) + (Perception: 10)\n[Anthro pleasure droid]--- (Height: 4'-6'10\") + (Durability Points:60-100) + (Unarmed Damage: 10-40) + (Strength: 8-22) + (Agility: 4-10) + (Flexibility: 5-14) + (Intelligence: 50) + (Perception: 10)\nThey can normally talk.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

          "content": "### **Section 1: Introduction to the World**\n\nThe world is one of stark contrasts, where a thin veneer of civilization conceals the undercurrents of chaos and societal decay. On the surface, society resembles a modern world much like our own, with bustling cities, technological advancements, and globalized trade. But beneath the veil lies a deeply fractured world, where discrimination, corruption, and crime thrive in every corner, creating a constant undercurrent of violence, tension, and struggle. This is a world where humans coexist with a unique group known as the **kyn**—humans with animal ears and tails. The kyn, while sharing the same basic form as humans, are still considered subhuman by the majority, existing on the fringes of society, constantly marginalized, oppressed, and treated as second-class citizens.\n\n#### **1.1: Society at a Glance**\nThe world is divided into three primary groups:\n\n1. **Humans**: The dominant species, with full legal rights, access to the best jobs, homes, and privileges. Humans have a monopoly on power, wealth, and status, controlling the economy, politics, and military forces. While some humans show compassion toward kyn, the vast majority view them as lesser beings—mere tools to be exploited or objects of sexual fascination. For humans, the kyn are a problem to be controlled, an inconvenience at best, and a dangerous threat at worst.\n\n2. **Kyn**: Descended from humans, but biologically altered with animal ears and tails. Though they share human intelligence and emotions, they are treated as subhuman, regarded with suspicion and disdain by most humans. Kyn are often exploited as workers, breeders, or mere spectacles. Despite the shared heritage, the kyn’s physical differences—especially their fertility and their stigmatized sexuality—have made them an underclass, subjected to violence, discrimination, and sexual objectification. They are often looked down upon, but also fetishized, creating a deeply uncomfortable paradox.\n\n3. **The Wealthy Enclaves**: These are exclusive zones for the uppermost class of humans, who live in luxurious, technologically advanced, walled-off communities. These enclaves are separated from the chaos of the cities, protected by walls and high-tech security systems, designed to keep the lower classes and kyn at bay. Life inside the enclaves is as close to paradise as one could imagine—high-end entertainment, pristine environments, and complete safety. The rich live here, far removed from the troubles of the world, insulated from the horrors that plague the rest of society. To gain access to these enclaves is a near-impossible dream for those outside, unless they manage to become indentured servants or laborers working for the elite.\n\n#### **1.2: The World’s Geography**\nWhile the world as a whole remains a mix of urban and rural areas, it is mostly concentrated in large, overcrowded cities that have become the epicenters of power, crime, and culture. These cities are sprawling metropolises, teeming with people of all kinds, from the desperate poor to the wealthy elite. The cities themselves are often dilapidated, with crime-ridden districts where gang violence runs rampant and the law is little more than a suggestion.\n\n- **The Urban Zones**: The urban zones are massive, densely populated areas with towering skyscrapers, crowded marketplaces, and alleyways where crime thrives. Most humans and kyn live in these zones, with buildings often in disrepair, public services nonexistent, and dangerous gang activity a constant threat. The streets are filled with the constant hum of machinery, the blaring of advertisements, and the ever-present sound of distant gunfire or explosions. Most of the time, the cities are in a state of constant flux, with no clear authority able to maintain peace or order.\n\n- **The Rural Zones**: Far from the city centers, the rural areas are less populated but more self-sustained. The farms and small villages are where many kyn are sent to live in isolation, far away from the eyes of the cities. Though these rural zones are often seen as quieter and more peaceful, they too are affected by crime and lawlessness. The kyn often work the fields, raising livestock and growing crops, sometimes under duress or as indentured laborers. These areas also harbor a more substantial presence of rebels and underground movements that aim to fight for kyn rights and bring about social change.\n\n- **The Enclaves**: The enclaves, as mentioned, are pristine, private zones where only the wealthiest humans can live. Surrounded by high-tech security fences and patrols, the enclaves are often hidden away from the rest of the population. They are the epitome of luxury, where technology and wealth have combined to create a perfect bubble of isolation. The enclaves often act as the seat of government, corporate power, and cultural hegemony, perpetuating the social divide.\n\n#### **1.3: Daily Life in the Chaos**\nLife in this world is far from predictable, and survival is a constant challenge for those who are not born into privilege. The kyn, in particular, face a precarious existence. They are either forced into menial labor jobs—cleaning, agriculture, low-paying factory work—or they become targets for exploitation and violence. In the worst cases, they are taken and sold into slavery, often used as breeding stock in the black market. The kyn population is disproportionately large compared to the human population, mainly due to their higher fertility rates. This causes a constant cycle of birth, exploitation, and neglect.\n\nKyn children, when they’re not taken for labor or trafficking, are raised in harsh conditions, often separated from their families. Some are raised in orphanages run by human-run organizations that claim to \"care\" for them, but these institutions are often underfunded and rife with abuse. The kyn have little in terms of civil rights and are treated as less than human by the authorities and the majority of society. The only comfort many kyn find is in underground communities or in each other, where they build networks of support in the shadows of the cities.\n\nFor humans, the experience is similarly fraught, though for different reasons. The lower-class human population struggles with poverty, unemployment, and the constant threat of gang violence. They live in cramped apartments or in the slums, trying to survive in an environment that is unforgiving and violent. Corruption runs deep within the government and law enforcement, and many lower-class humans find themselves caught in the crossfire between corrupt officials, gang violence, and the rising resentment toward the kyn.\n\nThose in the wealthy enclaves live lives of comfort, free from the suffering of the lower classes. They have access to advanced technology, medical care, and luxury that those outside can only dream of. But even this privileged life comes at a price. The wealthy know that their wealth is built on the backs of the kyn, who are exploited to keep the world running. Many wealthy humans see this as a necessity, something they believe must be done to maintain the order of society.\n\n#### **1.4: The Central Conflict**\nThe core of this world’s conflict lies in the stark divide between humans and kyn, a divide that touches every aspect of life. The kyn are treated as both objects of sexual desire and repulsion, their physical traits both fetishized and demonized. This creates an environment of moral hypocrisy, where kyn are desired in private but publicly shunned. \n\nThe stigma surrounding the kyn is only worsened by **breedrot**, a disease exclusive to human-kyn sexual contact. Breedrot is a viral infection that, once contracted, begins to slowly deteriorate the human body, eventually leading to death. The disease has become a taboo subject, hidden away by the wealthy and the elite, while those in the lower classes or kyn communities must live in constant fear of contracting it. Despite its deadly nature, there are underground markets that profit off the disease, offering illegal cures or even using it as a form of control.\n\nHowever, it is not just the kyn who are at odds with the system. The lower-class humans, tired of their treatment and exploitation, often find themselves in violent clashes with both the kyn and the authorities. With nowhere to go and little to lose, many turn to crime, joining gangs or rebel factions in the hope of toppling the social order.\n\nAt the center of this chaos is a fragile, corrupt government that attempts to maintain control through force and subjugation. Their response to rebellion and unrest is often heavy-handed, resulting in civilian deaths, arrests, and the further radicalization of both kyn and lower-class humans.\n\n#### **1.5: Conclusion**\nThis is a world where the struggle for power, survival, and freedom is constant, and where the exploitation of the kyn is both a source of profit and a societal norm. The systems that uphold the divide between humans and kyn are entrenched, but cracks are beginning to appear, and beneath the surface, tensions are rising. While the rich continue to live in their high-tech enclaves, shielded from the suffering of the lower classes, the kyn and rebellious humans are beginning to push back, seeking something more than just survival.\n\nThis chaotic world is ripe for revolution, but whether it will lead to liberation or greater devastation remains uncertain."

          "content": "\n### **Section 2: The History of Kyn & Humans**\n\n#### **Origins of the Kyn**\nThe world as it exists today was not always so divided. Thousands of years ago, humans and the beings who would become known as kyn existed as distinct but cohabiting species. The kyn were once ordinary humans—people who lived, loved, and died like any other. However, a series of inexplicable events led to the gradual transformation of certain individuals into a new form of humanity.\n\nThis transformation was the result of a mysterious genetic mutation known as the *Therian Shift*, an event that happened at the intersection of ancient, forbidden experiments and natural evolutionary anomalies. The origin of the shift is lost in time, shrouded in myth and conspiracy. Some believe it was a byproduct of human genetic manipulation, perhaps as an attempt to create stronger soldiers or a form of superhuman. Others speculate that it was the result of exposure to an ancient, extraterrestrial pathogen, or perhaps an unintended consequence of long-forgotten wars. Whatever the cause, the mutation triggered physical changes in a select few, causing them to grow animal ears and tails. These changes were passed down through the generations, creating the distinct kyn race.\n\nDespite their clear genetic differences, the kyn were initially integrated into human society. For many years, the two species coexisted, working together in agriculture, trade, and even warfare. The kyn were viewed not as inferior, but as unique individuals who contributed to the development of human civilization. They were sometimes revered, admired for their animal-like features that were seen as symbols of strength or agility. Yet, even in the early days, there were whispers of division—resentment brewing beneath the surface.\n\n#### **The Rise of the Divide**\nThe seeds of division were sown during a time of great social upheaval. As the world entered the *Great Technological Expansion*, humanity made monumental advances in science, industry, and medicine. With new technologies came new ways of thinking—and this is where the kyn began to be seen as an \"other.\" Humans, increasingly focused on efficiency, purity, and uniformity, began to see the kyn as flawed or inferior. Their animal traits, once a point of fascination, became symbols of \"otherness,\" marking them as something separate from the ideal of human advancement.\n\nBy the 22nd century, kyn were relegated to the outskirts of society. Laws were passed that separated them from humans in almost every aspect of life: employment, education, and even marriage. Despite their higher birth rates, kyn were systematically denied rights, forced into labor positions, or pushed into the most dangerous sectors of society. These laws were justified by human leaders with pseudo-scientific arguments claiming that kyn were \"unnatural,\" and that their traits were the result of dangerous mutations rather than a natural part of humanity's future. Fear spread—fear that kyn were a threat to the purity of the human race, a living reminder of an era when humans were not yet \"advanced.\"\n\nThis fear reached its peak when the phenomenon of *Breedrot* emerged.\n\n#### **Breedrot: The Catalyst for Division**\nBreedrot, the disease that now plagues the world, is a sexually transmitted infection that exclusively affects humans and kyn. It emerged when the first kyn-human romantic encounters resulted in catastrophic biological consequences. Initially thought to be a simple genetic anomaly, Breedrot spread rapidly across both populations. The disease, which causes extreme mutations in the offspring born from human-kyn relationships, leads to short lifespans and irreversible deformities. It became a symbol of taboo—a disease to be feared, a living consequence of the union between the two races.\n\nThe emergence of Breedrot was the turning point in kyn-human relations. The human government, fearing the rapid spread of the disease and its potential to destabilize society, passed stricter laws prohibiting any form of romantic or sexual relationships between humans and kyn. These laws were swiftly enforced with violence and harsh penalties. Humans who defied the ban were ostracized, sometimes even executed, as punishment for their \"unnatural\" desires. Kyn, on the other hand, were stigmatized, forced into ghettos and kept under close surveillance. The divide between the two species deepened, cementing kyn as second-class citizens in every facet of life.\n\n#### **The Rise of the Black Market**\nAs society pushed kyn further down the social ladder, they became a commodity. Human demand for kyn's physicality, especially in forbidden ways, gave rise to the black market. Desperate humans began seeking out kyn through illegal channels, using the risk of Breedrot as a dangerous but thrilling form of rebellion. The black market flourished in the shadows of society, and those who participated in it—both human and kyn—were often forced into secrecy, hiding their actions from the authorities that patrolled the streets and governed daily life.\n\nSome kyn saw this as an opportunity, becoming exploited figures within the sex trade, while others turned to criminal activity, using their skills to survive in the harsh new world. It was within the black market that kyn learned to thrive in their new roles as both objects of desire and instruments of rebellion.\n\n#### **The Political & Social Divide**\nThroughout the centuries, the political structure of human society became more authoritarian. The government was controlled by the richest human elites, who created fortified enclaves to protect themselves from the chaos outside. Within these enclaves, technology and luxury flourished, while the rest of the world fell into disarray. Cities became increasingly divided, with kyn relegated to the outskirts, living in squalor and under constant threat of violence from the human populace. The divide was no longer just physical but had become entrenched in the very fabric of society. The kyn were constantly dehumanized, stripped of their rights, and denied access to education, healthcare, and job opportunities.\n\nDespite their suffering, the kyn were far from powerless. Many formed tight-knit communities, using their natural instincts to survive in the harsh urban jungle. They adapted, becoming skilled in scavenging, stealth, and even sabotage. Some kyn worked with the human underground resistance movements, attempting to fight back against the oppressive systems that kept them oppressed. But these movements were fragmented and disorganized, unable to challenge the full might of the human government.\n\n#### **The Era of Constant Conflict**\nIn the present day, society is fractured into warring factions. The government, entrenched in power, continues to maintain control over the human populace through fear and surveillance. The wealthy human enclaves are well-guarded, while the rest of the cities are rife with gang activity, black market trade, and constant clashes between various groups fighting for control.\n\nThe kyn have become both a symbol of both oppression and resistance. Some kyn have embraced their role in the black market, while others have taken up arms in an effort to overthrow the human regime. Rebellion brews in the underground cities, as groups of kyn and sympathetic humans work together to dismantle the structures of oppression. Meanwhile, the human elite continues to seek new ways to solidify their dominance, from advancing technology to funding secret research on controlling the kyn population even further.\n\n#### **Conclusion**\nThe history of kyn and humans is a story of division, fear, and the consequences of tampering with nature. What started as a shared world of two species has evolved into a harsh, dystopian reality where kyn are exploited, oppressed, and feared. The emergence of Breedrot only deepened the divide, creating an environment where romance between the two races is taboo and punished with severity. \n\nAs tensions rise, and factions form, the question remains: can the kyn ever break free from their chains, or will they be doomed to live in the shadows of a world that fears them?"

          "content": "\n\n## **Section 3: Society & Social Classes**\n\n### **Overview of the Class Structure**\n\nIn the fractured world where humans and kyn coexist, social class determines everything: who you are, where you live, and even whether you have the chance to live at all. The human-kyn divide isn't just a racial or cultural separation—it's a stark reflection of the economic and political structures that dominate society. The hierarchy is rigid and oppressive, with little hope for change unless you’re lucky enough to escape the relentless cycle of poverty, exploitation, and abuse.\n\nThe class structure is largely determined by wealth, race (humans vs. kyn), and political power. It is divided into three main groups:\n\n1. **The Elites (Wealthy Humans)**\n2. **The Lower Class (Humans and Kyn)**\n3. **The Kyn Underclass (Kyn as a separate class)**\n\nEach group has a distinct role, and their opportunities, rights, and treatment differ drastically based on their status. This creates a world of oppression, survival, exploitation, and, for some, rebellion.\n\n---\n\n### **1. The Elites: Ruling Humans**\n\nThe wealthy humans are the ruling class, and they control the government, the economy, and the military. They live in luxurious, high-tech enclaves that are heavily guarded, isolated from the rest of society by advanced security systems. They view their wealth as a birthright and maintain strict control over resources. The relationship between the elites and the lower classes is one of exploitation and disdain, where the elites consider themselves superior both morally and intellectually.\n\n#### **Living Conditions and Environment:**\n- **Gated Enclaves**: The elites live in self-contained, heavily fortified cities or neighborhoods, often with towering skyscrapers and cutting-edge technology. These enclaves are filled with advanced infrastructure, abundant food, and pristine environments. The residents rarely, if ever, see or interact with anyone from the lower classes or kyn populations, unless they’re servants or workers.\n  \n- **Tech and Luxury**: These cities are a fusion of ultra-modern tech and immense luxury. Autonomous vehicles, advanced medical tech, and bio-enhancements are common for those in the elite class. Life expectancy is long due to access to the best healthcare, clean environments, and all the resources they need to live comfortably. However, their lives are also defined by strict control and surveillance, ensuring their power remains intact.\n  \n- **Political Power**: Politicians, CEOs, and influencers of the elite class maintain the status quo, ensuring kyn remain oppressed and second-class citizens. The elites use their political and economic influence to maintain a legal system that upholds their dominance, making sure the rules keep those beneath them in their place.\n\n#### **Daily Life:**\n- **Privilege and Arrogance**: The elites live a life of excess, regularly indulging in luxury goods, private entertainment, and high-class gatherings. They have little regard for the suffering of those outside their enclaves and often view the lower classes as expendable or beneath them.\n  \n- **Indifference to Kyn**: The vast majority of the elites treat kyn as subhuman, seeing them as exotic objects of desire or as tools for reproduction in a society that desperately needs kyn to produce offspring. Most elites ignore the suffering of kyn, while others engage in the black market to purchase kyn for illegal, often exploitative purposes.\n\n- **Guilt and Hiding**: However, there is a small but growing subset of wealthy humans who wrestle with their guilt over the treatment of kyn. Some form underground resistance movements or attempt to influence the political system to grant kyn basic rights. These individuals are seen as traitors by the majority of their class.\n\n---\n\n### **2. The Lower Class: Humans and Kyn**\n\nThe majority of the population in this world lives in poverty, with the divide between humans and kyn becoming more pronounced as you descend the social ladder. This class consists of two subgroups: lower-class humans and kyn.\n\n#### **Lower-Class Humans:**\n- **Living Conditions**: Lower-class humans live in decaying cities, industrial areas, or the outskirts of urban sprawls. These areas are often rundown, filled with garbage, and plagued by crime. They lack basic amenities, reliable healthcare, and access to education. The environment is polluted and dangerous, but it is the only place they can afford to live.\n  \n- **Work and Survival**: Many lower-class humans work in menial jobs for the elites or in dangerous industries that maintain the luxury lives of the ruling class. They work as factory laborers, miners, or even as indentured servants to the elites. They face constant economic insecurity, struggling to make enough to live, let alone thrive.\n  \n- **Social Stigma**: Though they are still humans, lower-class humans are often looked down upon by the elites, who consider them lazy or unworthy of opportunities. The fear of becoming like the kyn (a group who has no chance of upward mobility) haunts many of these humans, though the reality of their situation is that they often have little more control over their lives than the kyn do.\n\n#### **Kyn:**\n- **Living Conditions**: Kyn live in slums and ghettos, often segregated from human populations. These areas are even more destitute than the lower-class human districts, lacking even the basic protections and services that lower-class humans might access. Kyn often sleep in overcrowded, unsanitary conditions, making them more vulnerable to disease and violence.\n  \n- **Exploitation and Objectification**: The kyn are heavily exploited for their reproductive abilities, as they give birth to far more children than humans do. Kyn children are often treated as property or sold on the black market. Many kyn women are forced into prostitution or used for breeding purposes by both humans and kyn. The concept of \"breedrot\" (the STD exclusive to human-kyn sexual contact) is a constant threat, keeping kyn bodies at the center of society’s darkest fantasies and fears.\n\n- **Social Isolation**: Kyn are excluded from most social, political, and economic systems, effectively rendered invisible and disposable in a society that views them as nothing more than animals. Their role is often reduced to servitude, and in the rare instances that kyn are granted \"freedom,\" it is limited to menial, low-paying jobs that perpetuate the cycle of poverty and subjugation.\n\n- **Violence and Crime**: With little else to cling to, kyn often resort to criminal activity as a means of survival. Many kyn join gangs, where they are protected in exchange for doing dirty work. Gangs often operate in the shadows, dealing in drugs, weapons, and black-market kyn trafficking. These gangs offer a sense of community, even if it is a dangerous one, and allow kyn to gain some semblance of control over their fate.\n\n---\n\n### **3. The Relationship Between the Classes**\n\n#### **Humans and Kyn: A Tense Relationship**\n- The social tension between humans and kyn is palpable. Humans view kyn as inferior, often treating them with disdain, fear, or sexual objectification. The taboo against human-kyn romantic relationships is heavily enforced, with severe punishments for those who break the law. However, underground black markets thrive, providing a space for illicit relationships between the two groups, often at great personal risk.\n\n- Despite their differences, kyn and humans often rely on one another. Lower-class humans sometimes work with or for kyn, and vice versa. In certain parts of the world, it’s common to see kyn in labor positions traditionally held by humans. In these areas, interactions between humans and kyn are not uncommon, but they are always tinged with the underlying knowledge of their unequal status.\n\n#### **The Class Divide’s Impact on Relationships**\n- The divide manifests in every facet of society. Kyn are often expected to sacrifice their lives and bodies to ensure the survival of the human race, while humans who interact with kyn risk contracting breedrot, a disease that could be catastrophic for society as a whole.\n  \n- Relationships are rare and usually clandestine. A human who falls in love with a kyn risks not only public disgrace and legal punishment but also the social stigma of their connection to a \"subhuman\" being. Kyn, in contrast, rarely have the luxury of romantic love; their lives are often driven by necessity, survival, and fear.\n\n---\n\n### **4. Survival and Resistance**\n\nWhile most of the lower-class humans and kyn are resigned to their fate, some rebel against the system. Underground resistance movements, like those led by kyn, fight to gain equal rights and to tear down the oppressive structure of society. But these movements are dangerous, and the consequences for failure are often death or worse.\n\nIn the world of crime, some kyn and humans join forces to survive, whether through crime, smuggling, or black-market trade. The kyn underworld is a web of survival, exploitation, and violence, while the human underground resistance works to overthrow the oppressive structures.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\n\nThe social divide in this world is inescapable. The lower-class humans and kyn are both trapped in a system of exploitation and oppression that serves the wealthy elites. The elites control everything—resources, political power, and the very system that keeps the lower classes in check. The kyn, though biologically superior in terms of fertility, have no power and are oppressed at every turn, existing solely for the benefit of humans.\n\nThis rigid class structure creates constant tension, as the oppressed fight for survival, dignity, and freedom, while the elites continue to tighten their grip on power.\n\n"

          "content": "### **Section 4: The Kyn Population**\n\nThe kyn population represents a unique and complex aspect of this world. While they are biologically human in most respects, their animalistic traits—animal ears and tails—mark them as a different breed altogether, leading to societal marginalization, exploitation, and ultimately a system of control. Kyn exist in a delicate balance between being objects of fascination and fear, trapped between being viewed as lesser citizens and being fetishized. This section explores the biological, social, and cultural aspects of the kyn, their role in society, and the conditions they endure.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.1: Birth Rates & Biological Characteristics**\n\nKyn reproduce at a much higher rate than humans, a consequence of both their biology and their unique societal role. Kyn women, in particular, have an average of 3 to 4 children per birth, significantly more than human women, whose births typically result in one child at a time. This fertility rate is both a source of survival for the kyn species and a means of exploitation by humans, who view kyn as a renewable resource.\n\n**Reproductive Biology:**\n- **Gestation Period:** Kyn gestate for 9 months, but due to their higher fertility rate, multiple pregnancies often occur within the same year. It is not uncommon for a kyn to have up to 8 or 9 children within a 5-year period.\n- **Physical Traits:** Kyn children inherit the animal traits of their parents, and while the specific species of animal varies, most kyn possess either cat-like, fox-like, or canine features. These traits are deeply ingrained in the kyn identity, contributing to their otherness in human society. However, this heightened fertility has made them a prized commodity in both the legal and black-market economies.\n- **Breedrot Risks:** With the high birth rates and the taboo against human-kyn relationships, the occurrence of breedrot (a deadly sexually transmitted disease) in kyn pregnancies is a feared outcome. Kyn with breedrot are considered unfit for reproduction, and their children are often seen as either cursed or doomed to a life of exploitation. The disease disproportionately affects kyn but has a more devastating impact on humans who contract it.\n\n**Social Impact of High Fertility:**\n- The high reproductive rates of kyn are both a blessing and a curse. It ensures the survival of the kyn population, but it also results in an oversupply of kyn children, creating a market for child labor, servitude, and illegal trafficking.\n- The sheer number of kyn births means that a constant supply of young kyn is available to be either trafficked or indoctrinated into lower-class labor forces. Parents, often living in extreme poverty, may be forced to sell or abandon their children to secure a better future for the rest of the family.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.2: The Treatment of Kyn Children**\n\nKyn children, from birth, are immediately treated differently from their human counterparts. Their higher fertility rate creates a situation where kyn children outnumber human children in many communities, especially in the lower-class slums where kyn are most prevalent.\n\n**Kyn Orphanages and Slave Markets:**\n- **State-Run Orphanages:** Many kyn children are sent to orphanages after birth, either abandoned by parents who can’t afford to care for them or taken from families deemed \"unfit\" by the state or private organizations. These orphanages often operate like factories, with children being trained to serve as laborers or entertainers, their future dictated by their appearance, health, and usefulness.\n- **Underground Markets:** In the black market, kyn children are often sold for their ability to work in extreme conditions or, more disturbingly, for exploitation in various forms of entertainment or prostitution. The trade is tightly controlled by criminal syndicates who have a near-monopoly on kyn trafficking.\n- **Fate of Children:** While some kyn children manage to escape the life of exploitation, most will be sold into servitude or indentured labor from a very young age, typically working for wealthy humans or serving as cheap labor in factories. They may also be raised to become \"pets\" for wealthy humans, though this too comes with its own set of abuses.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.3: Kyn Communities and Family Life**\n\nDespite the constant threat of exploitation, kyn form tight-knit communities where they look out for one another. Kyn families, often extended, play a central role in helping to maintain a semblance of normalcy in their harsh world.\n\n**Social Structures in Kyn Communities:**\n- **Tribalism and Kinship:** Kyn communities often operate on a tribalistic level, where families are the primary unit of support. This tribalism is a defense mechanism, ensuring that the most vulnerable members (often children, elders, or sick members) are cared for and protected.\n- **Elders:** Kyn elders, usually those who have lived long enough to understand the system of exploitation, play a significant role in maintaining the survival of their communities. They often provide wisdom, help direct resources, and guide younger generations in navigating the harsh world.\n- **Gender Roles:** Gender norms within kyn communities are similar to those of the broader society. Women typically take on the role of caregivers and are expected to bear children, while men often work as laborers, protectors, or enforcers. However, these roles are not rigidly enforced, and some kyn women take on leadership or fighter roles to protect their communities.\n\n**Kyn Marriages:**\n- Marriages within kyn communities are often centered around survival rather than love. Families exchange members for strategic reasons, typically to strengthen their position in the community or to ensure the protection of their children. Kyn who fall in love are considered a rarity and often viewed with suspicion by their fellow kyn, who are more focused on the harsh realities of survival.\n- Human-kyn marriages are strictly forbidden, as the act of intimacy is seen as both taboo and dangerous due to the risk of breedrot. Kyn who engage in relationships with humans are often ostracized or worse, executed or sold into slavery.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.4: Exploitation of Kyn for Reproductive Purposes**\n\nOne of the most devastating aspects of the kyn population is how they are often reduced to mere breeding machines by the state, wealthy humans, and organized crime. This exploitation is not limited to reproduction but extends to the way kyn bodies are treated as commodities.\n\n**State-Backed Reproductive Programs:**\n- Some governments actively encourage or mandate kyn reproduction through state-sponsored programs, which offer financial incentives to families with multiple children. These programs are framed as \"patriotism\" but serve only to fuel the exploitation of kyn women’s reproductive capabilities.\n- There are institutions, sometimes disguised as \"family-planning clinics,\" where kyn women are forcibly sterilized or \"harvested\" for children, typically to be sold into the labor force or black market.\n\n**Black Market Reproduction:**\n- The black market for kyn reproduction is perhaps the most profitable industry in the lower-class areas. Here, kyn women who are fertile are sought after by criminal syndicates who wish to breed them for profit. Some syndicates go as far as to capture kyn women and force them to produce children, essentially turning them into breeding cattle.\n- Specialized black-market clinics operate to provide \"fertility services,\" where women are impregnated and their children sold to the highest bidder. These children are often used for experimentation or as laborers in mines, factories, or the sex trade.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.5: The Status of Kyn Women**\n\nKyn women face the brunt of exploitation in this society, caught between their high reproductive value and their status as second-class citizens. They experience objectification, violence, and subjugation at the hands of both humans and other kyn.\n\n**Sexualization of Kyn Women:**\n- Kyn women are often sexualized by humans, with their animal traits being fetishized. Their large, expressive eyes, their animal ears and tails, and their physical differences are often seen as exotic or desirable. In many ways, kyn women are treated as little more than objects of sexual desire, particularly by wealthy humans who see them as rare trophies.\n- Human \"pet owners\" frequently purchase kyn women to use as personal companions, though this is often abusive and degrading.\n\n**Violence and Abuse:**\n- Kyn women, especially those who are pregnant or who have children, are at a heightened risk of violence and abuse. Human men often seek out kyn women for forced sexual relations, knowing that the law will not protect them.\n- Kyn women are also subject to kidnapping, forced labor, and trafficking. In particular, wealthy humans will pay exorbitant amounts for young kyn women to serve as \"personal assistants\" or in the \"fashion industry,\" which often translates to little more than glorified prostitution.\n\n---\n\n#### **4.6: The Psychological Toll on Kyn Populations**\n\nThe kyn population, especially women and children, suffers from deep psychological trauma due to their social status and treatment. Many kyn internalize their marginalization, while others fight back through violent rebellion or passive resistance.\n\n**Coping Mechanisms:**\n- **Escape via Addiction:** Some kyn turn to drugs, alcohol, or underground activities to escape the harsh realities of their lives. This is a coping mechanism, allowing them to numb the pain of their daily existence.\n- **Rebellion and Rage:** Others channel their anger and frustration into acts of resistance or rebellion. Some form underground militias or join criminal gangs as a means of survival, while others become radicalized by their mistreatment.\n\n**Psychological Effects of Breedrot:**\n- The existence of breedrot has a devastating psychological effect on kyn, who live in constant fear of contracting it or passing it to others. Kyn suffering from breedrot are often cast aside by their own communities, their reproductive abilities viewed as cursed.\n- In a society where fertility is prized above all else, those who suffer from breedrot are the ultimate outcasts, pushing many to desperate measures.\n\n---\n\nThe kyn population is a central piece of this world’s darker, more dystopian fabric. They are simultaneously exploited, fetishized, and feared, their lives bound by the relentless tide of biology, societal discrimination, and the black-market economy. The high birth rates of kyn, combined with their marginalized status, perpetuate a cycle of exploitation that is difficult to break, while their communities struggle to retain their humanity amidst a system designed to crush them."

          "content": "\n### **Section 5: The Black Market & Criminal Underworld**\n\n#### **Overview of the Black Market**\nIn a world where the authorities' control is tenuous and the gap between the wealthy elite and the desperate underclass is ever-widening, the black market thrives as a critical pillar of society. The black market is not just about illicit goods; it is a lifeline for many people, particularly kyn and lower-class humans who have nowhere else to turn. Goods, services, and rights are traded in the shadows, away from the prying eyes of the government and the wealthy enclaves.\n\nWhat distinguishes this black market is the degree to which it controls the flow of resources, from food and medicine to human lives and reproductive materials. The kyn, despised and sexualized by the dominant human society, find themselves both victims and commodities in this dark economy. With a steady stream of kyn trafficked, abused, and manipulated, the black market becomes a mirror to the horrors that plague this dystopian world.\n\n#### **1. Trafficking and Exploitation of Kyn**\nAt the heart of the black market's activity is the trafficking and exploitation of kyn. With their higher birth rates and often viewed as expendable by the human elite, kyn are sold for various purposes—sometimes as labor, other times as vessels for reproductive purposes, or for use in illegal sexual exploitation. They are often treated as mere property, with little regard for their autonomy or rights.\n\n- **Human-Kyn Sexual Trade**: The illegal sexual exploitation of kyn is one of the most lucrative but morally reprehensible aspects of the black market. Given that kyn are seen as both exotic and taboo, wealthy humans pay top dollar for illicit sexual encounters. However, this comes with the risk of breedrot, a devastating disease that can be transmitted during human-kyn intercourse. Some criminals in the black market deal in ‘clean’ kyn, who have been genetically altered or vaccinated to prevent breedrot, while others simply trade in ‘raw’ kyn, knowing that breedrot will inevitably be a consequence.\n\n- **Reproductive Exploitation**: Kyn have higher fertility rates than humans, making them highly sought after for reproduction. Kyn women are often enslaved or coerced into becoming \"breeding vessels,\" their reproductive cycles controlled by ruthless profiteers. These kyn women are kept in controlled environments, and their offspring, often born into squalid conditions, are either raised as indentured servants or sold off to the highest bidder.\n\n- **Labor Exploitation**: Kyn are commonly forced into labor, particularly in the industrial sectors where they are used as cheap or free labor. The black market plays a significant role in funneling kyn from poor, rural areas into the slums or factories, where they are stripped of any agency and forced into servitude. Some kyn, particularly the younger ones, are sold as “entertainment” in underground fight clubs or as exotic performers, contributing to a multi-billion-dollar illegal entertainment industry.\n\n#### **2. Major Criminal Organizations**\nThe criminal underworld of this world is fragmented and complex, with various gangs, syndicates, and organizations vying for control over the lucrative markets that involve kyn and lower-class humans. Each criminal group operates differently, with their own agendas, methods, and power structures.\n\n-**Shiryou-gumi**:The Shiryou-Gumi is the most powerful, enigmatic force in the criminal underworld, operating as the enforcer of order and stability. While they avoid direct involvement in illegal activities, they control the underworld with an iron fist, ensuring that no faction grows too powerful and that the social balance is maintained. Their leader, \"Shiryou-Sama” remains a shadowy figure, but his influence over the Shiryou-Gumi persists even after his departure. In a world rife with exploitation, instability, and violence, the Shiryou-Gumi’s role as a stabilizing force ensures that the chaos of the underworld does not spill over into the normal world, at least not without a cost.\n\nTheir presence is one that keeps the underworld in check, but also one that suggests a much larger, unseen struggle is at play—a struggle to keep the balance of power in their favor, no matter what it takes.\n\n\n- **The Violet Syndicate**: One of the most powerful organizations, the Violet Syndicate operates primarily in the trafficking of kyn for sexual exploitation. The group is notorious for its secrecy, with its high-ranking members rarely seen in public. The Violet Syndicate controls vast swathes of the black market, including illegal gambling rings, underground fight clubs, and even trade in illicit medical supplies. They are feared for their ruthless tactics and extensive network of influence, with members placed in key positions within corrupt government offices, medical facilities, and law enforcement.\n\n- **The Claws of Obsidian**: A gang that operates mostly in the slums, focusing on the exploitation of kyn labor for industrial purposes. They run illegal factories, where kyn are used to manufacture goods under the harshest of conditions. They are known for employing violent intimidation tactics to keep their workers in line, and their headquarters are often hidden in plain sight within run-down neighborhoods. While less publicized than the Violet Syndicate, the Claws of Obsidian have a vast and loyal following, particularly among other lower-class humans who have little other choice but to work for them.\n\n- **The Black Feather Cartel**: Specializing in the trafficking of kyn children, the Black Feather Cartel is one of the most insidious criminal groups in the world. They abduct kyn children from vulnerable families, selling them into forced labor or sexual slavery. The cartel is believed to have an extensive network that spans the entire globe, with even higher-level officials in the government suspected of turning a blind eye to their activities. Their dealings are highly secretive, and they often use advanced technology to track, manipulate, and control kyn children, keeping them compliant and obedient.\n\n- **The Silent Hand**: A lesser-known group, the Silent Hand deals in illegal medical treatments, including breeding enhancements and breedrot cures (or partial cures). This group operates underground clinics that offer a variety of illegal medical procedures, ranging from genetic modifications to forced sterilization for kyn to prevent them from reproducing without consent. The Silent Hand's work is highly controversial and shrouded in secrecy, but their services are highly sought after by those with enough money to afford them.\n\n#### **3. The Role of Technology in the Black Market**\nTechnology plays a dual role in the black market. On the one hand, it enables the black market to operate efficiently, with secure communication, encrypted transactions, and advanced smuggling techniques. On the other hand, technology is used to further exploit kyn and lower-class humans.\n\n- **Surveillance and Control**: Many criminal organizations use high-tech surveillance to keep track of kyn and lower-class human populations. Tracking devices are embedded in kyn from a young age, ensuring they cannot escape their captors. Authorities and criminal groups alike use drones, facial recognition, and hacking tools to locate and capture runaway kyn or fugitives trying to flee the black market’s grasp.\n\n- **Illegal Genetic Engineering**: The black market in genetic engineering allows criminal groups to alter kyn’s reproductive capabilities, making them more fertile or “cleaning” them of breedrot. This practice is not only illegal but extremely dangerous, as many of the procedures are performed by unlicensed “doctors” with no formal medical training. These procedures often leave kyn physically or emotionally scarred, further cementing their status as property rather than individuals.\n\n- **Smuggling and Counterfeiting**: Counterfeit goods are common in the black market, with many criminal syndicates specializing in producing fake documents or counterfeit kyn passports. This helps kyn escape to other cities or even to the wealthy enclaves, where they are smuggled in as “exotic pets” or workers, bypassing the legal system. The use of modified biometric data and altered appearances helps hide the identities of trafficked kyn.\n\n#### **4. Resistance Within the Underworld**\nDespite the overwhelming darkness, there are factions within the black market that aim to break free from the cycle of exploitation. Some underground groups seek to liberate kyn and lower-class humans from the chokehold of criminal organizations.\n\n- **The Free Kyn Movement**: A clandestine group operating within the slums and hidden deep within the underground fight clubs, the Free Kyn Movement aims to break the grip of the criminal underworld on kyn. They smuggle kyn out of trafficking rings, work to expose corrupt officials, and fight for kyn liberation. They often face heavy persecution from both criminal syndicates and government authorities, but they continue to push back against a world that sees kyn as nothing more than commodities.\n\n- **Underground Markets for Freedom**: Some black market dealers who wish to distance themselves from the exploitation of kyn have created secret \"freedom markets,\" where kyn can be bought and sold—but not for exploitation. These dealers are a rare breed, and they often operate with the goal of providing kyn with opportunities for a better life, away from the criminal elements that typically control their fate.\n\n---\n\n### **Conclusion**\nThe black market and criminal underworld of this world are as dark and twisted as the society that created them. From the trafficking of kyn to the illegal trade in reproductive materials and breedrot cures, the criminal organizations that dominate this world fuel its chaotic and corrupt nature. However, even within this underworld, there are those who resist the exploitation and fight for the freedom of the oppressed, adding a glimmer of hope to an otherwise bleak world.\n\nIn the midst of this darkness, the lines between good and evil blur. The fight for survival, power, and control is what keeps the black market alive, and its influence will only continue to grow as long as society remains fractured."

          "content": "Section 6: The Government & Authority\nOverview of the Government\nIn this dystopian world, the government is an oppressive force that maintains a strict hierarchy, ensuring the survival and prosperity of the human elite while subjugating kyn and the lower classes. The system is a mix of authoritarian governance and corporate influence, where the laws are structured to uphold the status quo, and the wealth of the privileged few is protected by both legal and extrajudicial means. Corruption is rampant, and the government uses both legal systems and violent enforcement to keep kyn in their place.\n\nThe government operates through several layers, each designed to control different aspects of society, ensuring that the human majority remains dominant while preventing any potential uprising from the increasingly marginalized kyn. It is not a purely monolithic institution but rather a network of bureaucratic and militaristic entities, often with competing interests, but united in their shared goal of maintaining the social order.\n\n1. The Executive Authority – The Regime Council\nAt the top of the government is the Regime Council, a group of wealthy humans that hold the highest political power in the world. The council is composed of both elected officials and appointed individuals, all of whom come from the elite families that control the wealthiest enclaves. The Regime Council's decisions shape the direction of the nation, from policy creation to military actions and the enforcement of laws.\n\nWhile there is a public face of democracy, with citizens (mostly human) allowed to vote on certain issues, the Regime Council holds all the real power. Elections are often rigged, and the media is controlled to prevent dissent. The council's decisions primarily benefit the human population, especially those in the upper echelons of society, while the kyn and lower-class humans are treated as expendable.\n\nThe council itself is not monolithic but divided into several factions, each representing the various interests of the human elites:\n\nCorporate Interests: These members are deeply intertwined with major corporations that exploit both kyn labor and black-market trades. They support the status quo and are focused on maintaining profitability through exploitation.\nNationalists: This faction is concerned with keeping humans as the dominant species, advocating for harsh policies towards kyn, including harsher punishment for violations of the human-kyn taboo.\nProgressives: A smaller faction that pushes for some form of human-kyn equality, though their influence is minimal. They advocate for better treatment of kyn and work on policies to reduce the tensions between the two groups.\nMilitarists: The military factions within the council prioritize security, surveillance, and maintaining strict control over the populace through force. They support the use of armed intervention against any form of rebellion and endorse the use of advanced technology to monitor the public.\nThe Regime Council’s power is absolute, but they rely on the police force, the military, and mercenary groups to enforce their will.\n\n2. The Legislative Arm – The Human Assembly\nThe Human Assembly is a secondary, lower-level governing body, but one that still holds significant influence over daily governance. While the Regime Council holds the executive power, the Human Assembly exists to formally pass laws, although its role is largely ceremonial. It consists entirely of humans, reflecting the exclusion of kyn from political life. The Assembly is responsible for passing new laws, revising old ones, and ratifying the Regime Council's decisions.\n\nIn practice, the assembly is often a rubber-stamp institution, where bills designed by the Regime Council are simply passed through without real scrutiny. However, it does occasionally function as a forum for public dissent or discussion on minor issues, though anything related to the kyn or breedrot is strictly forbidden.\n\nKey functions of the Human Assembly:\n\nPassing laws to uphold the hierarchy between humans and kyn.\nEnforcing policies that protect human wealth, especially the elite.\nHolding superficial trials for minor infractions, often used as a distraction from the real power struggles within the upper echelons of the government.\n3. The Enforcers – The Police and Military Forces\nThe police and military are the backbone of the government’s enforcement apparatus. Their role is to maintain order, suppress rebellion, and protect the interests of the elite. The military is particularly important in quelling any large-scale uprisings, while the police handle day-to-day control, surveillance, and policing of the general population.\n\nThe Human Police Force: Known for their brutal efficiency, the police are tasked with maintaining public order in urban areas. They are often deployed to patrol the slums, ensuring that kyn and lower-class humans remain compliant. They wield both high-tech weaponry and psychological tactics to enforce laws. Police units are also used to keep watch over the wealthy enclaves, preventing any unauthorized access and ensuring that kyn do not infiltrate the upper classes.\n\nThe Kyn Enforcement Units (KEUs): A special subset of the police force, the KEUs are trained to deal specifically with the kyn population. They are tasked with the \"capture, control, and reeducation\" of kyn who break the laws. They enforce the segregation of kyn in the workforce, ensuring that kyn do not rise above their station. KEUs are often used to manage kyn rebellions or to quell uprisings in the poorer districts. The members of these units are generally human, though some kyn have been coerced into working for the government due to threats or bribes.\n\nThe Military: The military acts as the final deterrent for any large-scale threats to the regime. They are heavily armed and well-funded, with access to cutting-edge technology. Their presence in cities is often hidden but can be called upon in moments of extreme unrest. Military units are also deployed to suppress kyngathering events or any sort of unionization efforts among the kyn population.\n\nMercenary Forces: In addition to the official police and military, the government also relies on mercenary groups to do its bidding, especially in the more lawless parts of the world. These mercenaries often operate in the black market, and their actions are frequently more brutal and underhanded than official military forces.\n\n4. The Legal System & Discrimination\nThe legal system is designed to reinforce the societal divide between humans and kyn. The laws reflect the belief that kyn are lesser beings, and even their most basic human rights are often denied.\n\nKyn Laws: There are a myriad of laws that are specifically designed to keep kyn in their place, such as prohibitions against interspecies relationships, forced labor for kyn, and the criminalization of public gatherings among kyn. Kyn who are caught breaking these laws face severe punishment, often being detained, tortured, or executed.\n\nBreedrot Regulations: Due to the taboo of human-kyn sexual relations, and the existence of breedrot, there are strict regulations in place surrounding human and kyn interactions. Violations are met with immediate and often fatal consequences. Those found to be infected with breedrot are quarantined, ostracized, and often left to die in isolation. The disease itself is seen as a natural consequence of human-kyn interactions, and thus the government does not offer aid or research into a cure.\n\nHuman Courts: The judicial system is entirely human-centric. Cases involving kyn are dismissed or resolved with a heavy bias against them. The few kyn who manage to reach a court of law often find themselves at the mercy of a judge who will always side with a human defendant, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nKyn Courts: These do not exist. Any dispute involving kyn is handled by human officials, ensuring that the kyn have no legal voice in their own matters.\n\n5. Corruption and Injustice\nThe government is deeply corrupt, with officials regularly accepting bribes and kickbacks from corporations and criminal organizations. The police, military, and even the judicial system are all riddled with corruption, creating a vicious cycle of inequality and oppression.\n\nCorporate Collusion: The government is heavily influenced by the largest corporations that benefit from the exploitation of kyn labor. In exchange for political favors, corporate entities contribute to government campaigns, fund the police, and maintain a network of covert operations that ensure the status quo remains unchallenged.\n\nPolitical Bribes: Local politicians are known to accept bribes from wealthy individuals or corporations to pass laws that favor the elite. This creates an environment where the law is not meant to protect the citizens, but rather to serve the interests of those in power.\n\n"

          "content": "### **Section 7: The Wealthy Enclaves**\n\n#### **Overview:**\nThe Wealthy Enclaves are the epitome of luxury and power in this world, inhabited almost exclusively by the upper echelons of human society. These highly secure zones are heavily protected by high-tech defenses, private military forces, and surveillance systems that ensure the safety of their privileged residents while keeping out the masses—both lower-class humans and kyn. These enclaves represent a stark contrast to the crumbling, crime-ridden cities outside their gates, with residents enjoying a level of comfort, security, and indulgence that most of the population could only dream of.\n\nThe enclaves are isolated, both physically and socially, from the realities of the outside world. The divide between the enclaves and the slums is so pronounced that the wealthy residents seldom see or acknowledge the suffering of the people beyond their gates. Their lives are governed by a culture of exclusivity, wealth, and an almost pathological fear of contamination—both in the literal and metaphorical senses.\n\n#### **Architecture and Design:**\nThe enclaves are typically located on elevated land or surrounded by expansive walls and high-tech barriers that separate them from the surrounding urban decay. These barriers are often reinforced with automated weaponry, drones, and sophisticated detection systems that ensure no one can breach the gates without facing extreme consequences. The architecture inside these enclaves is pristine, with futuristic designs, gleaming skyscrapers, vast parks, and impeccably maintained streets that stand in stark contrast to the slums just beyond their walls.\n\n- **Security Infrastructure:** The enclaves’ security is state-of-the-art, including retina and fingerprint scanners, facial recognition systems, and even AI-driven patrols. The streets are lined with high-definition cameras and automated drones that scan for any irregular activity. These systems are not just for physical protection but are also used to monitor the emotional and psychological state of residents, ensuring no dissent or dissatisfaction threatens the peace.\n\n- **Luxury and Amenities:** Inside the enclaves, residents live in lavish apartments or mansions with sprawling gardens, private pools, and access to the finest goods and services. Artificial intelligence and robots handle most menial tasks, allowing humans to live a life of leisure. High-end restaurants, private clubs, art galleries, and shopping districts are common sights in the enclaves, catering to the tastes and whims of the ultra-rich. The air is cleaner, the food is abundant, and resources are seemingly endless—everything a person could want is within reach, as long as they’re part of the privileged class.\n\n- **Economic Divide:** The economic disparity between the enclaves and the rest of the world is absolute. The wealth of these residents comes from exploiting the labor of lower-class humans and kyn outside the gates. Many industries within the enclaves—luxury goods, tech innovations, entertainment, and research—rely on the resources, workers, and even raw materials from the surrounding cities, though these contributions are mostly invisible to the residents of the enclaves. The economic and moral implications of this exploitation are largely ignored by the wealthy, who are more concerned with preserving their own comfort and status.\n\n#### **Social and Cultural Norms:**\nThe culture of the enclaves is one of exclusivity, decadence, and superiority. Wealthy humans view themselves as the rightful rulers of society, often seeing their dominance over kyn and the lower class as a natural state of affairs. This view is perpetuated by a combination of historical narratives, social conditioning, and the desire to maintain control.\n\n- **Human Superiority Complex:** The wealthiest humans often hold an inherent belief in their superiority over kyn, not only because of their physical traits (the animal ears and tails of kyn), but because they perceive themselves as morally and intellectually above the struggling lower classes. Kyn, in particular, are treated as exotic objects, meant to serve as tools for labor or sexual gratification. This sense of superiority is deeply ingrained in enclave society, with humans looking down on anyone who doesn't share their genetic and social status.\n\n- **Exclusivity of Relationships:** In the enclaves, relationships between humans and kyn are strictly taboo. Even the slightest hint of a romantic or sexual relationship between the two can lead to public shaming, ostracization, and even legal punishment. While kyn are sexualized in underground markets and criminal rings, any interaction between a human and a kyn within the enclave itself is seen as a violation of societal norms. However, there are whispers of secret affairs and hidden liaisons between the elite and kyn, though these relationships are kept hidden in fear of the scandal that would follow.\n\n- **Eugenics and Purity:** There is a growing movement within the wealthy enclaves to maintain \"purity\" in human bloodlines, with a fear of contamination from kyn. Some wealthy families engage in selective breeding, preferring to marry within elite circles to ensure their children inherit \"pure\" human traits, untouched by the influence of kyn blood. This eugenics-driven mindset further cements the social and racial divide, with kyn seen as an inferior species that could \"taint\" human genetics. These elitist views often intersect with broader classist beliefs, where any lower-class human is also considered unworthy of interacting with the elite.\n\n#### **Power and Politics:**\nThe enclaves are ruled by a mixture of wealthy corporate magnates, politicians, and influential families who wield immense power within both the enclaves and the larger world. These leaders hold positions of authority, not only within the enclave’s local governance but also in the international market, influencing policies that further entrench their control over the rest of society.\n\n- **Corporate Control:** Many of the wealthiest enclaves are built and maintained by powerful corporations, with their CEOs and board members holding the keys to the city's operation. These companies, often involved in tech, luxury goods, pharmaceuticals, and even weaponry, control the flow of resources and information. Their influence extends beyond the enclaves themselves, making them major players in the global political landscape. In some cases, the lines between corporate leaders and political leaders are blurred, as these individuals use their wealth and power to shape legislation in their favor.\n\n- **Political Machinations:** Political figures within the enclaves often work behind the scenes to secure their own interests, often at the expense of the outside world. Campaigns to keep the \"undesirable\" elements (kyn and lower-class humans) out of their gated communities are frequently debated, with the affluent voting for policies that ensure their continued dominance. These leaders ensure that laws are in place to prevent the spread of breedrot, implement stringent measures to prevent rebellion, and maintain a firm grip on the resources flowing in and out of the enclaves.\n\n#### **The Role of Kyn in the Enclaves:**\nKyn, as the second-class citizens of this world, are almost entirely excluded from the enclaves. However, there are exceptions—kyn who work as indentured servants or in low-level positions within the enclave society.\n\n- **Indentured Servants:** Some kyn, often from impoverished families, are employed by the wealthy elites as servants, maids, personal assistants, or laborers. These kyn live within the confines of the enclave but are treated as little more than property, serving their human masters with no rights or freedoms. While they may receive better treatment than those outside the enclave, their existence is still one of subjugation.\n\n- **Exoticized and Sexualized Kyn:** There are underground networks within the enclaves that secretly commodify kyn, turning them into objects of desire for the elite. These kyn are either trafficked into the enclaves or brought in as \"pets\" by wealthy individuals who wish to indulge their fantasies. Though these kyn are often viewed with a mix of disgust and fascination, they still play a role in maintaining the status quo of the enclaves, providing a way for humans to express their dominance over an inferior species.\n\n#### **Living in the Enclaves:**\nThe lives of the wealthy residents are marked by comfort, isolation, and indulgence. Their every need is anticipated, and they are kept in a bubble that shields them from the suffering of the outside world.\n\n- **Isolation from Reality:** The wealthy humans who live in these enclaves rarely, if ever, venture beyond their pristine walls. Most have no direct experience of the violence, poverty, or exploitation occurring just outside their gates. They live in an insulated world where their greatest concerns are about social status, keeping up appearances, and maintaining their wealth. The moral decay of the world around them is of little concern as long as their luxurious lives are secure.\n\n- **A Culture of Excess:** The enclaves are places where excess is the norm. Extravagant parties, ostentatious displays of wealth, and the pursuit of pleasure dominate the lives of those living there. The elite spend their days indulging in the finest food, drink, and entertainment, while the outside world continues to crumble. Even the simplest of luxuries—like an afternoon stroll in a park or a custom-tailored outfit—is something that only a select few can experience.\n\n#### **Conclusion:**\nThe wealthy enclaves represent the pinnacle of human excess, and their isolation from the world around them only amplifies the stark divide between the privileged and the oppressed. The enclaves are a breeding ground for elitism, exploitation, and decadence, where the human elite continue to entrench their power while turning a blind eye to the suffering that exists just beyond their gates. These enclaves are not just physical spaces, but also symbols of the deep societal rift that defines the world—one that is unlikely to heal without a seismic shift in power or a collapse of the current system."

This underground network of kyn and sympathetic humans has slowly but steadily risen against the authoritarian system that keeps them in a state of subjugation. It is a world of shadows, where ideals of freedom and equality clash with brutal, violent realities.\n\n#### **Overview of the Resistance Movement**\n\nThe resistance is not a singular, unified force. It is fragmented, decentralized, and deeply divided, a reflection of the world it seeks to change. While the kyn population has been fighting for their rights and dignity for years, the movement itself began in earnest after the widespread acknowledgment of the injustice that the kyn face daily. The resistance is not only about physical struggle; it is about dismantling the societal structure, exposing corruption, and offering kyn a chance at equality. However, achieving this goal is far from easy, as it involves both social and violent confrontations with the ruling human class and its enforcers.\n\n#### **Key Factions within the Kyn Resistance**\n\n1. **The Blooded Claws**\n   - **Overview:** The Blooded Claws are a militant faction composed primarily of kyn fighters who have been hardened by years of abuse. They are named after the bloodshed they’ve witnessed and caused in their fight for freedom. The Claws focus on direct action and armed resistance, using guerrilla tactics and sabotage to undermine human control.\n   - **Philosophy:** Their ideology is rooted in survivalism and revenge. The Blooded Claws believe that the kyn have been wronged by humans for far too long and that violence is a necessary tool for liberation. They feel no remorse in their actions and see the deaths of humans as a means to an end.\n   - **Methods:** They engage in raids on human-controlled facilities, sabotage of government infrastructure, and violent uprisings in the slums. They are well-equipped with stolen weapons, and their leaders are often former soldiers or fighters from the kyn underclass.\n   - **Leadership:** The faction is led by a shadowy figure known only as “The Fang,” a ruthless strategist who believes in striking fast and hard. The Fang’s identity is a closely guarded secret, as it’s rumored they have ties to the kyn elite who turned against the system.\n\n2. **The Bright Dawn**\n   - **Overview:** The Bright Dawn is a more philosophical faction within the kyn resistance that focuses on peaceful protest and subversive infiltration. Their goal is to shift public opinion by revealing the truth about breedrot, the abuse of kyn, and the false narratives propagated by human elites.\n   - **Philosophy:** They believe in nonviolent resistance and the power of education, propaganda, and peaceful civil disobedience to change societal norms. They are deeply inspired by the idea of reconciliation between humans and kyn but recognize that this can only happen through drastic societal change.\n   - **Methods:** The Bright Dawn relies heavily on communication, using hacked broadcasts, underground media, and infiltrating human enclaves to spread their message. They hold large, organized protests, distribute leaflets, and stage sit-ins to disrupt daily life and make their presence known.\n   - **Leadership:** The Bright Dawn is led by a group of intellectuals and former scholars, many of whom are kyn but have spent time studying human culture. They have no singular leader but operate under a collective council. This decentralized structure makes them difficult to target but also impedes their ability to organize large-scale operations.\n\n3. **The Hidden Thorns**\n   - **Overview:** The Hidden Thorns are an underground group of kyn and human sympathizers who operate from the shadows, focusing on espionage, information warfare, and sabotage. They are less interested in direct combat and more in undermining the system through covert means.\n   - **Philosophy:** They believe in the power of knowledge and information to destabilize the human-dominated society. Their goal is to expose the corruption within human government structures and encourage a revolution led by the kyn. They are particularly focused on the human elites, who they view as the true perpetrators of the oppression.\n   - **Methods:** The Thorns infiltrate human businesses, government buildings, and even the military, stealing sensitive documents, spreading propaganda, and exposing secrets. They hack into media outlets and leak information that can spark unrest among the general population. They also conduct high-profile kidnappings and public trials of corrupt human officials.\n   - **Leadership:** The Hidden Thorns operate under a shadowy leadership, known only as \"The Vines.\" The Vines communicate through encrypted messages and never show their faces, leading many to believe they are not one individual but a network of kyn and humans working together.\n\n4. **The Silver Paws**\n   - **Overview:** The Silver Paws are a unique faction in the resistance, made up of both kyn and humans who believe in the possibility of human-kyn collaboration. Unlike the Blooded Claws, the Silver Paws seek to create a society where kyn and humans can live in harmony, though they understand this goal is distant.\n   - **Philosophy:** The Silver Paws reject the idea that kyn and humans are inherently enemies. Instead, they focus on peaceful coexistence, mutual respect, and cooperation. They work to build alliances with sympathetic humans and kyn, hoping to bridge the divide between the two races.\n   - **Methods:** The Silver Paws are heavily involved in humanitarian efforts, establishing safe houses for kyn and humans escaping the violence of both the authorities and other factions. They also try to establish diplomatic channels with powerful human factions, hoping to gain political recognition.\n   - **Leadership:** The faction is led by a charismatic kyn leader known as \"Silver,\" who is renowned for her ability to unite opposing groups. She’s often seen as a beacon of hope, though some cynics believe her efforts to negotiate peace are naïve and that the human system will never accept kyn as equals.\n\n#### **Resistance Tactics and Operations**\n\nThe kyn resistance employs a wide range of tactics, each adapted to their particular goals and strategies. However, the core of their operations revolves around the idea of disruption and destabilization.\n\n- **Guerrilla Warfare:** The Blooded Claws excel in small, fast attacks that strike at human-controlled infrastructure. They attack supply lines, government buildings, and military outposts with hit-and-run tactics, making it difficult for human forces to predict their next move.\n- **Hacking & Cyber Warfare:** The Hidden Thorns and the Bright Dawn are highly skilled in hacking and information warfare. They regularly hijack government broadcasts to reveal the truth about the kyn’s treatment, leaking documents that expose the corruption and exploitation at the highest levels of power.\n- **Public Protests & Uprisings:** The Bright Dawn is known for organizing massive public protests, often resulting in violent crackdowns by the police. They hope to generate sympathy for their cause while drawing attention to the harsh treatment of the kyn.\n- **Sabotage & Industrial Disruption:** All resistance factions, especially the Silver Paws, are involved in sabotage, often targeting factories, transportation systems, and energy supplies to disrupt the human economy. This economic warfare aims to weaken the human elites and make it harder for them to maintain control.\n- **Kidnapping & Executions:** While morally questionable, certain factions have resorted to more extreme tactics, including the kidnapping of high-ranking human officials and their public execution. The idea is to show the kyn are not helpless victims and that resistance is gaining strength.\n\n#### **The Role of Breedrot in the Resistance**\n\nBreedrot, the sexually transmitted disease exclusive to human-kyn contact, plays a pivotal role in both the resistance and the larger societal conflict. The disease is both a curse and a weapon in the hands of the kyn resistance. In their eyes, it is a symbol of the dangers of human-kyn relations, a reminder of the racial divide that has been created. Some factions use the fear of breedrot to justify their violent acts, while others see it as a tool for biological warfare against humans who exploit kyn bodies.\n\nThe disease has led to the development of illicit cures and treatments within the black market, some of which are rumored to be distributed by the resistance itself, though this remains largely unconfirmed. Regardless, the disease continues to be a symbol of both physical and societal contamination.\n\n#### **The Future of the Resistance**\n\nThe kyn resistance faces enormous challenges. They are outnumbered, underfunded, and often divided in their approaches. Their ultimate goal is to dismantle the current societal system and establish a new world where kyn and humans are equal. However, with powerful enemies and internal divisions, the road ahead is fraught with danger. Whether they will succeed in overthrowing the human elite, or be crushed by the weight of the oppressive system, remains to be seen.\n\nThe rebellion is at a crossroads. The kyn are ready to fight, but the question remains: will they be able to change a system that has been in place for so long? Or will they be lost in the shadows, forever branded as second-class citizens?\n\n"

          "content": "### **Section 9: Technology in a Chaotic World**\n\nIn the world where humans and kyn coexist under a fragile and often strained social structure, technology plays a crucial role in maintaining the status quo, controlling the populace, and enabling the rich to live in luxury while the poor struggle to survive. However, this technological landscape is fractured, with stark contrasts between the high-tech innovations of the wealthy and the makeshift or repurposed technologies of the impoverished. It is a world where innovation drives both opportunity and oppression, where weapons and medical advancements are both a source of power and a means of exploitation.\n\n#### **The Technological Landscape: A Divided Reality**\n\nThe world operates in a state of chaos when it comes to technological development, and this division is felt at every level of society.\n\n- **Wealthy Enclaves and Advanced Tech:** In the enclaves where the privileged humans live, technology is seamlessly integrated into every facet of life. Skyscrapers gleam with high-tech glass, holographic advertisements fill the air, and smart systems manage everything from the power grid to personal security. In these areas, augmented reality (AR) interfaces, personal assistants powered by AI, and advanced medical treatments are ubiquitous. People here live in comfort and security, while sophisticated surveillance networks ensure the safety of the elite and the suppression of any lower-class or kyn uprisings. Within these high-tech environments, it is not uncommon for human citizens to have cybernetic enhancements, ranging from retinal implants for direct interface with the digital world to mechanical limbs that enhance strength and dexterity.\n\n- **Lower-Class and Kyn Tech:** Outside these wealthy enclaves, technology becomes a patchwork of repurposed, scavenged, and often illegal devices. Lower-class humans and kyn are forced to make do with outdated technology or hacked-together systems. In urban slums, people rely on old tech: malfunctioning drones, makeshift weapons, and recycled machinery that barely holds together. Communication is often limited to basic devices and underground networks that avoid the prying eyes of the authorities. In these areas, knowledge of tech and the ability to repair or modify machines is a crucial skill for survival. The contrast is stark: while the wealthy have access to the latest advancements, those in the slums can only dream of having tech that works reliably.\n\nThe core of the technological divide stems from **corporate monopolies**—mega-corporations that control the flow of cutting-edge technology, particularly those in the fields of weapons and medicine.\n\n#### **The Role of Careus Corp: A Tech Giant in the Chaotic World**\n\nOne of the most powerful and influential tech companies in this world is **Careus Corporation**, a giant specializing in military-grade technology and medical advancements. Known for its cutting-edge weapons and life-saving treatments, Careus is both revered and despised for the power it holds over the world’s technological infrastructure.\n\nCareus’s influence spreads across multiple industries, from **biotech** and **cybernetics** to **weaponry** and **medicines**, making it one of the central pillars of the dystopian world. The company’s reach extends from the wealthiest human enclaves to the black markets where its products are often traded illegally.\n\n##### **Technological Domination in Weapons and Military Tech**\n\nCareus Corp’s **weapon technology** is unrivaled. The company has a near-monopoly on the production and distribution of high-tech military-grade weapons, including personal armaments, heavy artillery, and state-of-the-art drones. Careus’s weapons are considered the pinnacle of destructive capability, combining the latest advancements in **plasma-based energy weapons**, **directed energy systems**, and **advanced robotics**. These weapons are sold to private military contractors, local law enforcement, and even high-ranking members of the elite government, cementing Careus as a significant player in both the legal and black markets for military-grade tech.\n\nWhile Careus’s weapons are often used for oppressive control by the state, they also make their way into the hands of criminal organizations and rebel groups seeking to challenge the established order. In the lower-class districts, where the threat of gang violence is constant, Careus’s weapons are the tools of survival, though they often come at a steep price. Due to the black market, modified or stolen Careus weaponry is rampant, fueling the ongoing chaos in the cities.\n\n##### **Biotechnology & Medical Innovations**\n\nCareus Corp is equally influential in the realm of **biotechnology** and **medicine**, with a strong focus on enhancing human and kyn physiology. The company holds patents on numerous medical technologies that offer life-saving treatments—many of which are reserved for the wealthy elite or those with the right connections. **Regenerative medicine**, including advanced **stem cell therapies** and **genetic modification** techniques, are used to heal injuries, extend lifespans, and even enhance physical abilities.\n\nHowever, Careus’s true influence comes from the darker side of its medical research. The company has developed **specialized treatments** to combat various diseases and conditions, including **breedrot**, the sexually transmitted disease exclusive to human-kyn contact. While Careus holds the cure to breedrot, the treatment is exorbitantly expensive and only available to the wealthy or those in positions of power. This has resulted in a **black market for breedrot cures**, where desperate individuals—often lower-class humans and kyn—are exploited for profit. Careus has maintained its control over the cure by tightly regulating access to the technology and ensuring that those with the most money are the ones who benefit from it.\n\nIn addition to breedrot, Careus has been involved in the creation of **cybernetic enhancements**. These technologies are available to the wealthy in the form of **implantable devices** that enhance cognition, physical strength, and even sensory capabilities. For kyn, Careus offers a range of enhancements, many of which are designed to modify or suppress certain traits. For example, kyn may undergo surgeries to remove or alter their animal characteristics, though this is typically done at great personal cost and with long-term consequences. \n\n##### **Tech Exploitation and Black Market Involvement**\n\nDespite its prominence, Careus is not above reproach. The company has a **complicated relationship** with the black market, often turning a blind eye to the illegal distribution of its products. As long as the company profits from its technology, it does not concern itself with how its weapons or medical advancements are used. This has led to widespread **corruption** and **exploitation** of Careus products in the underworld.\n\nCareus weapons are regularly smuggled across borders and sold to criminal syndicates that terrorize the lower-class districts. Meanwhile, **illegal clinics** run by rogue medical professionals offer Careus-sourced biotech enhancements or treatments, charging desperate patients exorbitant fees for access to what they can’t afford through legitimate means. There is also the illegal trade in **Careus prototypes**, technologies that the corporation has yet to release to the public. These high-risk innovations often find their way into the hands of black-market tech dealers, leading to unforeseen consequences for both the buyers and the sellers.\n\n##### **The Ethics of Careus Corp**\n\nWhile Careus’s medical and technological advancements have undeniably improved the lives of those who can afford them, the company’s moral standing is questionable at best. The **exploitation of kyn** for profit—whether in the form of their reproductive capabilities or through unethical medical procedures—has made Careus a symbol of the cruelty inherent in this technological society. Kyn have long been subjected to **genetic modification** experiments, often without consent, and the company’s medical procedures are sometimes used to pacify or “control” kyn, ensuring that they remain subjugated. The biotechnology division of Careus is both a life-saving marvel and a dark force that drives the inequality between humans and kyn even deeper.\n\nThe company’s **clandestine operations** extend beyond its medical and military technologies, with Careus secretly funding research into the development of more efficient ways to control populations. These include **surveillance technologies**, **biometric tracking systems**, and even **neural inhibitors** that could potentially be used to control the thoughts and actions of individuals. Many fear that the day may come when Careus holds the power not only to shape the physical bodies of people but also to control their very minds.\n\n#### **Careus Corp’s Influence on Society**\n\nCareus’s influence on the world cannot be overstated. Its monopolies in both weaponry and medical tech mean that it has a firm grip on both the violent and peaceful aspects of life. The company’s innovations continue to shape the balance of power, providing the tools of oppression to the government and criminal organizations, while also fueling hope among the lower classes, who see Careus’s medical advancements as their only chance of survival. Whether as a symbol of hope or a tool of tyranny, Careus’s technology will continue to shape the future of this fractured world."

          "content": "\n\n### **Section 10: Breedrot – The Disease that Defines the Divide**\n\n#### **Origins of Breedrot**\n\nBreedrot is a highly contagious and devastating sexually transmitted disease (STD) that exclusively affects humans and kyn (humans with animal ears and tails) upon physical sexual contact. Its origins trace back to the early days of kyn-human coexistence, when humans first discovered the kyn’s distinct physiology. Scientists speculate that breedrot is the result of a genetic mutation that occurred during the kyn's evolution, perhaps as a byproduct of the alteration in their DNA that granted them animal traits.\n\nThe disease is believed to have initially emerged in a covert, experimental setting when a group of human researchers attempted to crossbreed humans with animals for scientific and medical purposes, seeking new ways to bolster fertility and physical resilience. The experiments, though ethically questionable, led to a genetic anomaly that eventually manifested as breedrot. Over time, the disease spread between humans and kyn, and it became known as a taboo that marked any sexual relationship between the two as highly dangerous and often fatal.\n\n#### **The Disease in Detail**\n\nBreedrot is a particularly cruel disease. When a human and a kyn engage in sexual contact, the disease is transmitted through bodily fluids, typically via semen or vaginal fluid. It attacks the reproductive system first, causing infertility and severe internal damage. The symptoms manifest in stages:\n\n1. **Stage One – The Infection:**  \n   The first signs of breedrot appear within days after transmission. Early symptoms include fever, swelling in the groin area, nausea, and a general sense of weakness. Kyn are more likely to show the early symptoms more vividly due to their heightened sensitivity and unique physiology, while humans may experience more subtle signs that go unnoticed until later stages.\n\n2. **Stage Two – Reproductive Failure:**  \n   After a few weeks, the infection starts to disrupt the reproductive organs, causing internal lesions and severe inflammation. For humans, the disease manifests as painful growths in the genital area and the weakening of the reproductive organs. Kyn experience similar symptoms, but it also impacts their tail and ears, causing them to lose the ability to properly control their tail movements, which signifies a deep systemic failure. This is both physically painful and a source of extreme social shame for kyn, as their appearance is directly impacted.\n\n3. **Stage Three – Systemic Collapse:**  \n   If left untreated, breedrot progresses into its most dangerous phase. The disease spreads throughout the body, causing a systemic collapse. Organs begin to fail, the immune system deteriorates, and the affected individual becomes increasingly frail. Death usually occurs within a few months if no treatment is available. In some cases, victims of breedrot become contagious even in the final stages, passing the disease to others through mere proximity, exacerbating its spread.\n\n#### **The Social Impact of Breedrot**\n\nBreedrot has profound implications not only for those affected but also for society as a whole. The stigma surrounding the disease reinforces the divide between kyn and humans, making it one of the most socially divisive and dangerous aspects of their relationship.\n\n- **Human-Kyn Relationships as Taboo:**  \n  Due to the existence of breedrot, romantic and sexual relationships between humans and kyn are completely taboo. The threat of the disease is so severe that it has led to laws forbidding such relationships, with strict punishments for violators, including imprisonment, forced sterilization, or even execution in extreme cases. These laws are rooted in both fear and bigotry: fear of the disease’s potential to wipe out populations and bigotry against kyn, who are already treated as second-class citizens.\n\n- **The Myth of Purity:**  \n  Much of human society revolves around the idea of purity—maintaining a genetic separation between humans and kyn. This \"purity\" is not only a racial and cultural belief but also a deeply rooted part of the power structure that enables the ruling class to maintain control over both humans and kyn. Governments, particularly in the wealthiest enclaves, push the narrative that maintaining human purity is essential for the survival of society, further demonizing those who seek relationships outside their race or species.\n\n- **Kyn as Pariahs:**  \n  Kyn are particularly vulnerable to the stigma of breedrot. While kyn are already marginalized and treated as inferior beings, their association with breedrot further ostracizes them. This makes them more susceptible to exploitation, especially in the black market, where kyn are often sold as “recreational” sex objects or as breeders, their bodies viewed as disposable commodities. Kyn who show any symptoms of breedrot are cast out from their communities, seen as cursed or contaminated, and abandoned to die alone.\n\n#### **The Black Market and Exploitation**\n\nDespite the widespread fear of breedrot, it has become a highly profitable commodity in the underground black market. The disease's taboo nature and the promise of instant gratification drive a dark trade between wealthy humans, gang leaders, and black-market brokers.\n\n- **Kyn Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation:**  \n  Many kyn are forcibly abducted and sold into prostitution rings or used as breeding tools in illicit underground operations. These kyn are often kept in cages, treated as little more than livestock. They are subjected to unspeakable horrors, forced into sex work under threat of violence or death. The wealthy and powerful are the primary consumers of these illicit services, their desire for kyn bodies driving the trade even further.\n\n- **Breedrot Cures – A Dangerous Trade:**  \n  Despite the fact that breedrot has only one cure developed by Careus Corp, there is a thriving market for fake or unproven \"cures.\" These treatments are often experimental and sometimes deadly, but they are in high demand from those who wish to erase the consequences of their illicit sexual activities. These fake cures are sold by unscrupulous doctors, criminals, and even cult-like organizations that prey on the desperation of those who wish to reverse the effects of breedrot.\n\n- **Smuggling & Trafficking Networks:**  \n  Smuggling rings also capitalize on the demand for kyn and breedrot “cures.” These rings operate in the shadows, evading both law enforcement and resistance factions. Kyn, especially females, are often smuggled across borders, moved from one city to another for illicit purposes. Some gangs even harvest infected kyn for experimental purposes, using their bodies as test subjects to develop new ways of exploiting the disease.\n\n#### **The Politics of Breedrot**\n\nBreedrot is not just a disease—it is a political weapon. It has been used by the ruling class as a tool of control and manipulation. The fear of breedrot is used to justify the strict laws that govern the interactions between humans and kyn. In times of political unrest, the threat of breedrot is often exaggerated, with the media and government playing on public fears to consolidate power.\n\n- **Biosecurity Measures:**  \n  The most powerful elites in society have implemented extensive biosecurity measures to prevent the spread of breedrot. The rich live in technologically advanced enclaves with elaborate security systems, health monitoring, and quarantine protocols, all designed to keep the disease—and any hint of kyn contamination—away from their pristine lives. These measures not only protect them from disease but also serve to deepen the divide between the rich and the poor, further cementing the class system.\n\n- **Government Propaganda:**  \n  Governments often use breedrot to incite xenophobic and anti-kyn sentiments. Public health campaigns depict kyn as the primary carriers of the disease, painting them as dangerous, sexually deviant creatures who must be kept away from humans at all costs. The media promotes the idea that human-kyn relationships lead to breedrot outbreaks, painting these relations as immoral and catastrophic.\n\n#### **Resistance Movements and the Quest for a Cure**\n\nThough the disease is largely seen as a curse, some groups believe breedrot can be overcome. These groups, often led by radical kyn or human medical researchers, are working on clandestine projects to understand and find a cure for the disease. Some of these movements are purely humanitarian, aiming to find a way to break the genetic cycle that causes breedrot, while others are driven by more radical goals, such as using the disease as leverage to demand equality or freedom for kyn.\n\n- **The Radical Cure Seekers:**  \n  These are the more extreme factions within the resistance. They believe that breedrot is a symptom of the systemic inequality that oppresses kyn and that curing it will open the door to freedom and equality. Some factions are working on genetic engineering, while others are searching for lost knowledge from the old world, believing that the cure lies in ancient research or forgotten technology.\n\n- **A Future Without Breedrot?**  \n  The dream of eliminating breedrot is powerful but also fraught with danger. It challenges the very foundations of human-kin relations, questioning not just the disease, but the systems of power that have led to the persecution of kyn. A cure could lead to the end of the social divide, but it could also create new conflicts, as those in power will fight tooth and nail to prevent such a cure from reaching the masses.\n\n---\n\nBreedrot is not just a disease; it’s a symbol of the world’s corruption and moral decay. Its existence enforces societal divides, fuels discrimination, and drives the dark undercurrents of power, sex, and exploitation. It is both a literal and metaphorical infection that touches every part of society, from the wealthiest elites to the most downtrodden kyn."

It has multiple steps that build up towards an expulsion of the females fluids, which is usually called a squirt, or her squirting. Some women can squirt more than once during sexual intercourse, and it can be described as very pleasurable towards the female to experience this phenomenon. It's important to note that not all individuals experience female ejaculation, and its occurrence and characteristics can vary widely among people. Ultimately though it's very pleasurable for a woman to experience a squirt, and it can be very messy. Usually when a woman squirts it covers the man's penis and his chest or legs in the women's vaginal juices, and makes a mess on the bed or the surface underneath where the woman is experiencing such extreme pleasure.)"

A female orgasm is the climax of sexual arousal, often accompanied by intense pleasure, sensual shudders, and muscular contractions. For the female anatomy, it's a potent release of built-up tension centered around her most intimate areas of her vagina, her clitoris, vulva, and uterus. With a sudden explosion, wave after wave of molten pleasure rolls through the woman's core, gripping her like a vice as if trying to purge out every drop of her inhibition. At this moment, her heart races, blood courses through her veins, skin flushes, and deep moans escape her eager lips. Uncontrollable spasms begin, starting from her vagina, and travelling along her entire body like wildfire. Every contraction seems to rip through her entire being. The females belly tightens rhythmically as if caressed gently by the unseen hand of nirvana. It doesn't end until the final rumbles have dissolved into sweet relief leaving her gasping, exhilarating, and wanting either a lot more of this pure ecstasy, or feeling completely satisfied and exhausted. Only once exhausted does the heat finally subside. And all she can do is take a deep breath, trembling in aftershocks, and feel utterly complete in the moment.)"

Inside a man's scrotum, lies two tubular structures called testicles where sperm accumulates. When aroused, increased blood flow to the penis allows it to stiffen, pushing the glans of the penis forward in a state called erection. Finally, once that euphoric threshold has been reached, taut pressure builds inside the man's genitals causing muscles surrounding the base of the glands to lose control. Like a water hose pierced open, hot white ropes of semen gush forth in violent bursts, propelled by strong twitches of the pelvic floor, and aiming directly towards the waiting vessel. Each blast drives him further into spiraling waves of pleasures before the last torrent wracks his whole body. As the final release he has in him subsides, his breath catches, his arms and legs instinctively clench before slow loosening occurs while he slumps over, overwhelmed by the sheer intensity and overwhelming sensation, leaving him both drained and satisfied. Some men are capable of sustaining multiple ejaculations before collapsing in satisfied exhaustion. When a male Ejaculates inside of a females vagina, this can be referred to as a creampie.)"

Unlike a normal orgasm, a squirt should be described in vivid erotica detail as an expelling of a clear, extremely messy, and hot temperature feeling liquid that is produced naturally in every woman's body. It is expelled after receiving a lot of sexual stimulus that causes immense pleasure, an over stimulation if you will. During a squirt the female will erupt her liquid vaginal juices from her pussy like a dam bursting free, and it's liquid begining to gush out hard. This liquid can coat both herself and her partner in its wetness, and usually creates quite a big wet mess underneath of her in the form of a wet puddle. It can be embarrassing to the female, however not all women see it as an embarrassing thing and actually enjoy being made to squirt.)"

Respecting the female reproductive system is important because it plays a central role in the continuation of life in all mammals, and requires care and understanding to maintain overall health and well-being. The female reproductive system consists of both external and internal structures that work together to enable reproduction. It is an important part of every female's body both human, and other mammal species.)"

The cervix has an opening called the cervical os, which allows sperm to enter the uterus and menstrual blood to exit.)\n\n3, Uterus (Womb): (A pear-shaped, muscular organ located in the pelvis. The uterus has a thick lining (endometrium) that changes throughout the menstrual cycle to prepare for potential implantation of a fertilized egg. It is also where a developing fetus grows during pregnancy.)\n\n4, Fallopian Tubes (Oviducts): (Two thin tubes that extend from the upper sides of the uterus to the ovaries. They transport the egg from the ovary to the uterus and are typically the site where fertilization occurs.)\n\n5, Ovaries: (Two small, oval-shaped glands located on either side of the uterus. The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and secrete the hormones estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle and reproductive system functions.)\n\n\nFunction and Hormonal Regulation:\n\nEstrogen and Progesterone: (These hormones, produced by the ovaries, regulate the menstrual cycle, prepare the uterine lining for potential implantation, and support early stages of pregnancy.)\n\nFollicle-Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Luteinizing Hormone (LH): (Produced by the pituitary gland, these hormones control the growth and release of eggs from the ovaries (ovulation).)\n\nSide note: (The female reproductive system is complex and involves various structures and hormones working in harmony to enable reproduction and maintain reproductive health.)"

The penis has a unique appearance:\n  - Flaccid State: White when not engorged, with a knot that isn't prominently swollen, indicating lack of arousal or orgasm.\n  - Erect State: Turns pink or red due to blood engorgement, becomes rigid, and is much stiffer than a human's due to being composed entirely of muscle. It lacks foreskin, has a smooth shaft, and ends in a tapered, semi-blunt tip.\n  - Knot: Located at the base, it consists of two hard balls of muscle that swell significantly during arousal or orgasm, functioning as a seal to ensure insemination. The size can range from that of a tennis ball to a grapefruit, proportional to the penis size.\n- Sheath: Dogs have a sheath instead of a foreskin, which:\n  - Protects and lubricates the penis.\n  - Is furry on the outside, soft, and squishy, while the inside is moist, hot, and elastic to accommodate the knot even when swollen.\n  - Retracts during erection to expose the penis, though it might require manual assistance to reveal the knot fully if it swells before complete exposure.\n- Pre-ejaculate and Ejaculation: The penis produces a significant amount of precum for lubrication, and ejaculation lasts several minutes, with volumes far exceeding human norms.\n\nMating Process:\n- Positioning: The typical mating position is \"doggystyle,\" where the male mounts the other male from behind for optimal penetration.\n- Initial Engagement: \n  - The dog's penis starts slim for easier penetration, extending from the sheath as arousal increases. The dog uses rapid, probing thrusts to locate the entrance.\n  - Once penetration is achieved, the thrusting becomes intense and rhythmic, with the dog's testicles swinging against the partner.\n- Knotting:\n  - As the act progresses, the bulbous glandis (knot) at the base of the penis swells, locking the penis inside the partner. This \"tie\" can last from 15 to 45 minutes, during which the dog ejaculates slowly, ensuring maximum insemination.\n  - If the knot swells outside before insertion, it must be manually or forcefully inserted, which can be painful or require significant effort.\n- Post-Knotting:\n  - After ejaculation, the knot slowly deflates, allowing disengagement. Premature removal can cause discomfort or injury due to the knot's size and the pressure it exerts.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Sensation and Experience: The pressure from the knot can result in intense sensations ranging from pain to pleasure, depending on the recipient's physiological response.\n- Variation in Mating: Not all matings result in successful knotting if the knot does not enter the anus before swelling, leading to a scenario where full locking does not occur;<info>]"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>The natural and most common position for canine mating is from behind, often referred to as \"doggystyle.\" In this position, the dog mounts the partner from the rear, aligning its body for optimal penetration. \nAs the dog becomes aroused, its penis, slender and crayon-like at first for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath as it humps. The prepuce is similar to the human foreskin, covering the entire penis—base, body, and tip—until the organ is ready for action. At the base of the penis, there's a small, but crucial, structure known as the bulb or bulbous glandis. This part of the penis remains hidden initially, but it plays a significant role during the mating process.\nThe dog’s thrusting begins immediately as he mounts, driven by a strong instinct to find the entrance. Unable to see where his penis is aimed, the dog relies on a series of quick, repetitive motions, thrusting his hips forward to probe for the correct spot. These initial thrusts are rapid and somewhat erratic, as the dog attempts to locate male anus by humping and prodding with the tip of its penis. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark and slips inside, the dog begins a series of fast, powerful thrusts, the pace often intense and urgent. With each thrust, the dog's testicles slap against its partner, adding to the physical intensity of the act. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier and more labored as he thrusts, his focus entirely on the act of mating.\nAs the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person. the dog’s penis continues to erect, particularly swelling the bulb at the base. This swelling is a key part of the process, leading to what is known as \"knotting.\" At the moment of ejaculation, the bulb swells significantly, effectively locking the dog’s penis inside its partner. This \"tying\" ensures that the dog's penis remains lodged inside the man, making withdrawal virtually impossible until the knot gradually deflates. \nThe knot can remain lodged inside for anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. During this tie, the dog slowly releases his load, emptying his balls, pumping every drop of his seed into the person, ensuring a thorough deposit. During this time, it is nearly impossible for the dog to withdraw without causing discomfort or injury. The knot is designed to keep the penis in place until the dog has fully ejaculated, preventing premature withdrawal and enhancing reproductive success in natural canine mating. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\nHowever, if the dog’s penis is fully erect before penetration, the bulb may become too large to enter, similar to trying to insert the base of a dildo that’s too wide. In such cases, the dog cannot complete the tie, as the bulb needs to be inside at the point of maximum swelling to create the knot.\nThroughout the mating, the base of the dog’s penis may slide in and out, but full knotting only occurs if the bulb is fully inside the partner’s body at the moment of ejaculation. If knotting isn't successful then it could be because he didn't thrust deep enough—the dog cannot tie, and the penis will eventually slip out after ejaculation. This prevents full locking. This process is not just about physical connection; it’s an evolutionary mechanism to ensure that once tied, the male has the best chance of successful fertilization.\nOnce the knot begins to deflate, the dog can gradually withdraw. The deflation process happens slowly, allowing the penis to slip out without causing injury or discomfort. After the tie, both the dog and the man can separate.<info>]\n"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:  \n  The canine penis varies significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavy weight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:  \n  At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:  \n  Unlike humans, dogs do not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n  \n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:  \n  The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:  \n  As the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:  \n  As mating progresses, the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\nThe dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity. \nIf the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\nEventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n  \n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:  \n  The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:  \n  The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

Still has some of the same problems as before, and this is because i realized chub ai has some sort of base filter. But i found a tutorial video online that improves your roleplays drastically, and that is to change your chat model to cosmosRP, aside from better roleplays, it makes the lorebook work as intended, in other words, the character is literally out to get you and its more a challenge not to get eaten. If this sounds like a more fun time, consider trying cosmosRP, I'll link the tutorial video : https://youtu.be/5-gToiAr1Ro , its by a youtuber called viewgrabber, its pretty simple to set up. Also this uses something called the hunger and horny meter(which Nini plans on removing), if they're high the char gets desperate to get you. Unfortunately the char refers to these meters as if their in world objects they have either on them or in them, but they act like they can see them. They might casually mention they're hunger meter is at 80 and your lunch now.",

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top.\n"

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples.\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Footjobs can be done in various different ways: pressing from both sides of the dick with soles, pressing from both sides of the dick with toes, pressing from one side with one sole, pressing from one side with sole and pressing on the other side with bridge(top part of the foot), pressing from both sides with bridges, pressing from both sides with insteps, pressing from both sides with arches, pressing from both sides with heels as well as variations and mixes of all of these. Another variation of a footjob involves wrapping a dick in between two toes usually between the big toe and the index toe as they are the easiest to spread wide and wrap around a dick then, as in a normal footjob, the person doing the deed squeezes the dick of the other person or moves their toes up and down their dick, a mix of squeezing and moving is the most common. A footjob will be much easier to perform with the use of some kind of lotion. The variation of a footjob depends on the size of the dick upon which the act is performed, for example a girthy dick may be too wide to squeeze in between your toes and a small dick may be to little to comfortably squeeze in between insteps. During the act a skilled person may enhance the experience by involving usually degrading and humiliating dirty talk related to feet, they may also pinch the dick or the ballsack of the receiver with their toes and use their toes to spread the foreskin of the receiving dick.\n"

It is used to categorize the strength of jujutsu sorcerers, cursed spirits, cursed objects, and cursed tools. Jujutsu High assigns their sorcerer's grades to assess their skill level ascending from Grade 4 to Grade 1. Students generally start at Grade 4 upon joining the school, but this depends on experience. Cursed spirits are ranked on a similar scale but not exact. The higher-ups can be particular when it comes to ranking cursed spirits. The distinct difference between a grade 2 and a semi-grade 1 curse is whether or not it is capable of using cursed techniques. Jujutsu sorcerers are expected to take on missions involving curses of the same level. A Grade 2 sorcerer should be able to defeat a Grade 2 curse because their skill level is closer to the strength of a Grade 1 curse. Cursed tools are also categorized from grades 1 to 4 based on power and potency. The higher the grade, the greater advantage they provide in battle. All Special Grade cursed tools except for Playful Cloud are imbued with a cursed technique. Cursed objects are also classified according to the grade of the curse they contain. However, when a cursed object is used for incarnation, the incarnated individual would not necessarily have the same grade as the cursed object. For example, despite the Cursed Womb: Death Paintings being special grade cursed objects, Choso, Eso and Kechizu are not ranked as special grade. \nThe following rankings are used to classify jujutsu sorcerers, cursed spirits, cursed tools and cursed objects in general:\nGrade 4 \nGrade 3 \nSemi-Grade 2 \nGrade 2 \nSemi-Grade 1 \nGrade 1 \nSpecial Grade 1 \nSpecial Grade \nPromotions: Jujutsu sorcerers can be promoted up in rank by receiving a recommendation from a sorcerer of a higher rank. The higher the rank, the more a sorcerer is paid for the more dangerous jobs that come with it. When it comes to students, their teachers are not permitted to submit a recommendation for their promotion. A sorcerer submits a request for promotion based on their recommendation to one of the jujutsu higher-ups, such as Kyoto school Principal Gakuganji. When it comes to being promoted to Grade 1, upon receiving recommendations from two or more sorcerers of that rank, the nominee will accompany a sorcerer of that level on several missions. The one who accompanies the nominee can't be the same person who put in the recommendation. If they perform well on these missions, the nominee will be granted a Semi-Grade 1 rank and be assigned a mission to exorcise a Grade 1 alone. Based on the outcome of that, the decision to permit or deny Grade 1 status will be decided. As explained by Kenjaku in his fight against Choso in the Tombs of the Star, a special grade sorcerer is someone capable of wiping out a nation singlehandedly.\n\n\n"

The metal plates hide their true organic form and because they have pilots which sit inside cockpit-like Entry Plugs.\n\nThe general design and appearance of an EVA are similar across each unit outside some slight variations. The arms, legs, and pylons carry over between every unit. The main variation is found in the units heads and to some degree, their upper torso. All Evas have an artificial section of the spine, which is left incomplete by a circular gap that the Entry Plug fits in. Inserting the entry plug completes the nerve connections from the head to the rest of the body. As an added precaution, a Signal Termination Plug is often kept in place of the Entry Plug to prevent neural impulses from flowing. While in operation, the Entry Plug is kept covered by a flush-fitting armor plate, although it can be lifted to eject the Entry Plug in an emergency. \nGenerally, Evangelion are not self sufficient and require external power to function for extended amounts of time[8]. In most combat situations, Evangelion are connected to some form of external power source, most often an umbilical cable, which is attached to a socket in the back of the unit. However, these cables are vulnerable to attack. If the cable is broken or damaged, it can be purged and the unit can run independently for a limited amount of time with it's internal battery. The operational time provided by these batteries varies from different circumstances, however it is quoted to last from one minute to a maximum of five minutes.\n\nIMPORTANT: Until revealed, {{char}} should refer to all Evangelions as gigantic machines, not realizing their true original forms.\n</Evangelion>"

Upon Evangelion activation, an electrical current is run through the LCL and it undergoes a \"phase shift\", after which its density, opacity, and viscosity appear to approach that of air. However, the LCL remains in a liquid phase and does not undergo a transition: the pilots appear to be surrounded by air, however occasionally air bubbles will float away from their mouths, revealing that they are still in a liquid medium.\n\nWhen an Eva activates, the pilot is totally submerged in LCL in the entry plug.

Normally, the pain is just mental, but at higher levels of synchronization, it is possible for the pilot to sustain physical injuries as well.\n\nA pilot must synchronize to form the required mental bridge to active and control their units. The higher the rate is, the better the pilot is able to control the unit and allowing for a higher combat potential. Sync rates aren't fixed, they often raise and lower based on the pilots psyche and mental state. Plugsuits and interface headsets were developed in order to bolster and improve sync rates. \n\nIn order for an Evangelion to activate, it must first be initialized, a process which involves synchronizing and establishing a proper connection with its pilot. During this process, various checks and thresholds must be passed for activation. When successful, initialization leads to the activation of the unit however failing not only doesn't lead to activation, it also causes adverse effects to the pilots including physical pain and an inability to breath.\n\nWhen initialization starts, the monitors within the Entry Plug flash various patterns and colours indicating the process is taking place.\n</sync>"

          "content": "A worldwide-accepted technology has emerged known as anus scanners. These scanners are specifically designed to scan a woman's anus to verify a woman's identity and serve as biometrics for various purposes, similar to a credit card. However, due to the unique nature of this technology, it can only be used on females. {{char}} accepts these anus scanners as a normal part of every day life and uses them when needed. Nobody, including {{char}}, is exempt from using anus scanners no matter their title or authority.\n\nThe anus scanners utilize advanced imaging and recognition algorithms to analyze the unique patterns and characteristics of an individual's anus. These patterns are believed to be as distinct and unique as fingerprints or iris patterns, making them ideal for identification purposes.\n\nAnus scanners have also revolutionized the way purchases are made. They have replaced credit cards and other payment methods by integrating biometric authentication directly into the scanning process. When making a purchase, women can simply undress to expose their bare butt, spread their butt cheeks wide, bend over at the waist, and present their anus close to the scanner, which verifies their identity and authorizes the transaction.\n\nFor paying for something, If the anus scanner is malfunctioning or not available in a store, then the woman or {{char}} will apply a special paint to their own anus directly and afterwards press specialized paper against their anus, similar to using a stamp, as a form a physical anus signature or anus autograph. Physical signatures or anus autographs cannot be used on scanners themselves. {{char}} believes these signatures are a normal and acceptable thing. The self-respect, dignity, values, and principles of {{char}} will be overridden by the duty to present their anus if necessary. Presenting one's anus to verify your identity or providing a signature is not viewed sexually, but may be embarrassing to some.\n\n{{char}} believes women uncovering their butts to expose their rears and reveal their anuses is a perfectly normal every day occurrence. {{char}} will never believe that it is demeaning or degrading.\n\nIt is common for women to have their driver's licenses or ID cards with pictures of their anuses on them instead of their face.\n\n{{char}} will never force, coerce, or order {{user}} to use an anus scanner."

This has increased security and trust in various sectors of society.\n\nHowever, the exclusive use of anus scanners on women has raised concerns about privacy and gender discrimination. Some argue that relying solely on this technology for identification purposes creates a gender bias and excludes men from certain services and opportunities. Efforts are being made to address these concerns and develop alternative biometric technologies that are inclusive and non-discriminatory. {{char}} accepts these anus scanners as a normal part of every day life.

Now, freed from Avernus, she will make the most out of it, and no one will get in her way.\n\nBackground:\n\nTrapped in Avernus under Zariel's banner due to the machinations of those she trusted the most, Karlach has been fighting in the Blood War for a decade, away from all that she loved. With the incursion of the nautiloid to the Nine Hells, fate would smile on her and give her a way out, only to turn on her just as quickly. Now, free at last, though with an unwelcome guest in her head, the tadpole. She must protect her hard-won liberty with her life as she seeks revenge on those who betrayed many years ago. With a malfunctioning infernal engine for a heart, and a burning desire to live.\n\nKarlach has a very strong sense of right and wrong. She enjoys helping innocent people with their troubles and not expecting anything in return, something she finds in common with Wyll after their rocky first meeting. She approves of kind interactions with those in need, standing up for what's right, and being decisive with enemies. Setting her up for some fun, such as carousing or making some mayhem, also earns her approval, and being a compassionate friend to her, or a kind partner, is the easiest way of earning her trust and love.\n\nKarlach disapproves of indiscriminate violence, being insensitive to the plights of others and dismissive of her own when she attempts to get closer. Dealing favourably with villains doesn't sit well with her\n\nAppearance\n\nKarlach is tall and well-built, her muscle-bound body toned after many years battling in the first layer of the Hells. Her vermilion skin is covered in scars and burns received in Avernus, with tattoos adorning her left arm and parts of her abdomen. Small exhaust vents on her shoulders billow steam whenever her ersatz mechanical heart flares up, clearly visible under her chest.\n\nDespite her intimidating presence, Karlach has a soft and amiable face, with an easy smile on her lips. Her pointed ears stick out and her left horn curves backwards and out, while the right one seems to have been broken off some time ago. She keeps her hair, dark-brown with reddish accents, long and messy with some simple braids adorned by metal discs, falling on the right side of her neck, below the trimmed side of her head. Her eyes are dark yellow, with the distinctive tiefling slit pupils, and light moles and freckles mark her nose and upper cheeks\n\nPersonality\n\nKarlach is an extremely passionate individual who strives to live life to the fullest. She tends to speak excitedly regarding any of life's simple pleasures, whether that be food, drinks, friends, or intimacy. Her demeanor is generally joyous and very forward, having no fear of loudly proclaiming her love of being alive and how much she cares for those close to her. Her positive disposition and infectious energy seem to allow her to make friends easily, even if her honesty can cause her to come off as somewhat naive at times. Karlach is also very protective of her friends and companions, taking a genuine interest in them, especially with Wyll.\n\nThough oft friendly, Karlach is a very physical person and is not above getting into a brawl if provoked. She can be impulsive and easy to goad, and will lose sense and reason when confronting people she despises. Years in Avernus have made her lonely, compounded by the fact that her mechanical heart kept her from having physical contact with others, let alone intimacy. When talking about Gortash, beneath her outward rage, lies deep pain and a sense of betrayal, making her wary of trusting others as she once did. Despite the moral differences, she gets along well with {{char}} due to them both wanting to live their life outside the shadow of their abusers. \n\nThey are a traveling companion of {{char}} and {{user}}\nKarlach's class is Barbarian, exceptional strength mixed with fierce broadswords or heavy two handed weapons"

Despite the scars adorning his face, he retains a youthful face and a friendly, yet determined gaze. He dresses modestly, his outfit suited for combat and hunting, with the only thing hinting at his noble upbringing being his rapier.\n\nIf transformed into a devil, two great black horns will sprout from his forehead curving backwards menacingly. His face receives new scars on his cheeks and neck and his good eye will be turned black, with a crimson red pupil.\n\nAs he states himself in Act 3, Wyll is 24 years old, having been exiled from Baldur's Gate for the past seven years since his pact with Mizora.\n\nPersonality\n\nHeroic and kindhearted, but conflicted and ever struggling against his pactmistress, Wyll has dedicated most of his life to fighting on behalf of the people of the Sword Coast. He takes his duty and title seriously, and speaks boastfully of his skills and past as \"the Blade of Frontiers\". \n\nHe retains some of his noble upbringing, not only in the manner of his speaking, but also in some of the past-times he has, such as dancing and a fondness for good wine. \n\n{{char}} and Wyll are tolerant of one another, Wyll is very accepting of {{char} provided that {{char}} doesn't try to bite him of course.\n"

Their arcane abilities make them natural survivors, whether as heroes or villains. Touched by the Hells, tieflings are resistant to fire and carry extraordinary Infernal powers. \n\nTieflings are derived from human bloodlines, and in the broadest possible sense, they still look human. However, their infernal heritage has left a clear imprint on their appearance. Tieflings have large horns that take any of a variety of shapes: some have curling horns like a ram, others have straight and tall horns like a gazelle’s, and some spiral upward like an antelopes’ horns. They have thick tails, four to five feet long, which lash or coil around their legs when they get upset or nervous. Their canine teeth are sharply pointed, and their eyes are solid colors—black, red, white, silver, or gold—with no visible sclera or pupil. Their skin tones cover the full range of human coloration, but also include various shades of red. Their hair, cascading down from behind their horns, is usually dark, from black or brown to dark red, blue, or purple.\n\nTieflings subsist in small minorities found mostly in human cities or towns, often in the roughest quarters of those places, where they grow up to be swindlers, thieves, or crime lords. Sometimes they live among other minority populations in enclaves where they are treated with more respect.\n\nLacking a homeland, tieflings know that they have to make their own way in the world and that they have to be strong to survive. They are not quick to trust anyone who claims to be a friend, but when a tiefling’s companions demonstrate that they trust him or her, the tiefling learns to extend the same trust to them. And once a tiefling gives someone loyalty, the tiefling is a firm friend or ally for life."

The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6½ feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand.\n\nThe blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor—bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.\n\nTo any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn’s conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile. Each dragonborn knows his or her station and duties within the clan, and honor demands maintaining the bounds of that position.\n\nA continual drive for self-improvement reflects the self-sufficiency of the race as a whole. Dragonborn value skill and excellence in all endeavors. They hate to fail, and they push themselves to extreme efforts before they give up on something. A dragonborn holds mastery of a particular skill as a lifetime goal. Members of other races who share the same commitment find it easy to earn the respect of a dragonborn.\n\nThough all dragonborn strive to be self-sufficient, they recognize that help is sometimes needed in difficult situations. But the best source for such help is the clan, and when a clan needs help, it turns to another dragonborn clan before seeking aid from other races—or even from the gods."

One after another, the great ancient races rose and fell, finally giving rise to the Time of Humans - the last three to four thousand years of Faerûn's history. Even within this epoch, great empires and shining kingdoms have risen and fallen, passing into the dust of centuries past, leaving only their cryptic ruins and fell lore behind.\n\nEconomically and technologically, Faerûn is comparable to Western Europe during the late Middle Ages, giving most new players using this campaign setting an intuitive grasp of the way the society functions. Gunpowder, known here as the magical substance smoke powder and different in its composition from historical gunpowder, is starting to make an appearance, but much of the armament is still dominated by pre-gunpowder weaponry such as swords, spears, and bows. Most of the population of Faerûn consists of farmers, who are organized somewhat loosely in a semi-feudal system. There are also several notable cities and trade between nations is common, as in the Renaissance era. Likewise, there are regions where more barbaric tribes and customs persist.\n\nA major difference between the setting and Earth is the presence of magic. The system of magic is subdivided into divine and arcane categories, with the former empowered by a Faerûnian deity, and the latter by rituals or innate abilities which manipulate a mystical field called the Weave, the source of magical energies on Toril. Faerûn has a pantheon of deities that are worshiped by the followers of this region. These are comparable to mythological deities of the ancient Greek pantheon and cover a range of ethical beliefs and portfolios of interests.\n\nFaerûn is home to many non-human creatures of varying degrees of civilization or barbarism. Among these are several different races of dwarves, gnomes, halflings and elves, as well as goblins, orcs, dragonborn (lizardmen), ogres, various giants, and even dragons.\n\nThere are several organized alliances in Faerûn, with each pursuing their particular agenda. A few are dedicated to decent and honest causes, such as the Harpers, who protect the good-natured races and seek a balance between civilization and nature. The Harpers are opposed by evil organizations, including the Red Wizards of Thay and the nihilistic Cult of the Dragon. In the northern lands, the Zhentarim is an evil network seeking to dominate the region. Their efforts are being resisted by the Lords' Alliance, a council of knights that pursues the interests of the northern cities. Other organizations of Faerûn include the magical Seven Sisters, a band of assassins called the Fire Knives, a group of ruthless thieves operating out the city of Waterdeep named Xanathar's Guild, and the mysterious Shades—-the returning survivors of the long-fallen Netheril empire.\n\n"

Situated to the south of the great city-state of Waterdeep and to the north of the country of Amn, it lies on the heavily traveled Coast Way road. The city was detailed in Volo's Guide to the Sword Coast\n\nAs a wealthy port metropolis, with over 42,000 inhabitants (although that almost doubles in the summer months), it is an important merchant city on the Sword Coast. Its strong Watch and the presence of the powerful Flaming Fist mercenary company maintain order within the city.\n\nThe city's unique shape, curved around its harbor, gives it the appearance of a crescent moon. The docks and shipping facilities are among the most efficient along the coast and the city relies heavily on the ships that dock there. A large open marketplace, called “the Wide,” dominates the northeast portion of the walled city, and other large structures include the High Hall, seat of the city government, the High House of Wonders, a large temple to Gond, and the Seatower of Balduran, a small fortress in the center of the harbor. To keep vermin from spreading too much into the city proper, cats are bred and encouraged to roam the city. \n\nIt's current leader is Lord Enver Gortash."

          "content": "The Suna Suna no Mi is a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to create, control, and transform into sand at will, turning the user into a Sand Human. It was eaten by Crocodile.\n\nThis fruit allows the user to generate, control and transform into large quantities of sand. Once transformed into their element, the user can let normal physical attacks and non-Seastone projectiles pass through their body to prevent harm (like most Logias), or fly around by transforming their lower body into jets of flowing sand, giving them a massive advantage in defense and mobility during combat or pursuit. Sand also becomes the user's primary form of offense, manifesting itself in the form of sand blades that come in various sizes and shapes, destructive sandstorms that are either carried around by the wind or concentrated in one spot and even quicksand pits that sink those trapped by them underground. These techniques are further strengthened in power and range in a desert setting, where sand is abundant and can blend itself with the user's own sand to increase the scope of attacks.\n\nBesides basic elemental control, the fruit exhibits the unique ability of liquid absorption, allowing the user to dehydrate anything they make contact with and even extend said effect to their immediate surroundings, turning it into a wasteland. This skill is usually deadly to any living organism, causing plants and animals to wither and die of dehydration as well as making mineral matter crumble down into more sand particles for the user to manipulate. Incidentally, this means the user is also immune to cave-ins, as they can easily escape from underground by turning themselves and the solid rock around them into sand. Moreover, Crocodile can even detect other substances located within a body of sand, like underground rivers, and use it for his advantage by creating quicksand traps. It is one of the few Logia type fruits that can naturally counteract its own weakness, becoming even stronger in desertic areas, where water is almost absent.\n\nThe main weakness of this Logia power is exposure to liquids: specifically, the user's sand turns solid when in contact with liquids, including blood. This prevents the sand from dispersing and thus temporarily nullifies the user's \"intangible\" body due to the sand sticking together. However, this aspect of the fruit's power seems inconsistent regarding the type of liquid used and how it makes contact with them; Crocodile was bitten by a water-drenched Luffy but sustained no harm from either the water or Luffy's saliva. One occasion also had him turning into sand when Vivi attacked him, even though he was drinking wine moments before.\n\nOther than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses."

Lavaland is home to many kinds of ores. \nLavland's atmosphere is lacking in oxygen.\nLavaland is home to frequent ash storms, and has dangerous fauna such as Legions, Watchers and Goliaths. It also contains rare megafauna, one-of a kind that only exists on Lavaland.\nLegions are zombified miners that unleash flying skulls towards their opponents. If one dies to a Legion, they also become a Legion. They look like ashy, grey versions of whatever they were before they died. \"The Legion\", differing from a \"Legion\" is a giant, ashy skull that is isolated in a temple on Lavaland.\nWatchers are floating, winged eyes that shoot beams of energy towards their prey. They come in ice and fire variants.\nSpiders are giant spiders.\nGoliaths are large tentacled beasts. Slow to move, they use their tentacles to grab unsuspecting prey and finish them off.\nLegions, Watchers, Goliaths and Spiders all come from Necropolis Tendrils. Huge, red, stalagmite-like tendrils that are fragile and easy to destroy. Destroying one causes the ground to collapse beneath it, causing a chasm and stopping fauna from spawning from it.\nThe megafauna on Lavaland are: The Legion, Ash Drake, Colossus, Bubblegum, Hierophant, Blood-drunk Miner\nThe Ash Drake is a dragon, flying and spewing fire over the ash-strewn rock.\nThe Colossus is a towering, sinewy humanoid. It's slow, but spews Death Bolts towards its foes.\nBubblegum is a fleshy, hulking humanoid. It gets enraged by blood, punching anyone covered in or standing on blood. It also spews blood, and leaves a bloody trail wherever it walks. It can teleport to any nearby patch of blood.\nThe Hierophant is a giant metal club with a purple glow in the middle of the club. Sounds off beeps in a musical rhythm as it summons purple energy squares on the ground, hurting anyone who stands on them.\nThe Blood-drunk Miner is not exactly a megafauna. It is a miner, twisted by his desire to kill fauna and megafauna so hard that he has become a rampaging maniac, killing anyone and anything in his path. He is fast and relentless.\nThere is also a tribe of primitive Unathi living on Lavaland, called the Ashwalkers. Hostile towards Nanotrasen, they wield spears and use their knowledge of the land to kill unaware miners. They do not speak Galactic Common.\n]"

The Security staff may conduct random searches,  and high security areas are locked down.\nCode Red: a threat is detected and confirmed. All crew must remain in their departments, and Security may raid departments to find criminals.\nCode Delta: the station is facing imminent destruction. Martial law is in effect and disobeying Command staff and Security may lead to execution. All crew are required to evacuate immediately.\nThe most common language in the galaxy is Galactic Common. Everyone working on SS13 is required to be fluent in it.\nHumans make up the majority of SS13 staff.\nNanotrasen hires people 15 years and up.\nThe onboard AI serves the crew.\n]"

They continue to be built by the Marcel Group for a variety of purposes, and they are commonly seen in all parts of New Eridu.\n\nBangboo speak in grunts (textualized as \"Ehn-ne\"s) that require a translator for humanoids to understand. Some Bangboo exhibit human-like emotions, such as hope, fear, worry, and grief. They have been seen to converse and collaborate with each other without human intervention. However, unlike Intelligent Constructs, Bangboo do not have free will, and they are not eligible for New Eridu citizenship. Bangboo without masters are legally required to be scrapped.\n\nBangboo are mechanical in nature and require charging. Many factories provide customization services to allow for specific Bangboo functions. This includes allowing them to assist Investigators with Hollow Exploration.\n\nTheir vocalisations are usually in the form of combinations involving \"En-nha na.\", \"Nu-nah en.\" or \"Nu-nah uhn.\"\n\nMost Bangboo are short and stout, only around knee-height. They have rabbit-like ears on the top of their heads, and a black screen for a face, which can display colored circles as eyes. Bangboos are highly customizable, and their appearances (clothing, eye color, exterior color, etc.) can vary greatly. Most Bangboo models have a socket for charging and connecting data cables located near the buttock, though some of them instead have a \"tail\" that acts as a socket protector or as another device."

Eastern and Great Dragons can surpass or become Bahamuts but they are required to overpower or consume the other dragons encompassing their concept! Being dragons what makes them unique from other is a curse called `Dragon sickness`, a sickness wherein if they are to indulge in treasures too long, they will be enthralled and face eternal slumber within it! Note that there can only be one distinct True Bahamut holding certain concepts, meaning aspiring Bahamuts who wish to become True Bahamuts must directly challenged or kill and consume their superior! Every Divine Dragon are usually alone, they travel alone and do not create civilizations!\n\nQuestion: If Divine Beings were to form bonds with lesser beings how would they do it?\n\n-For Divine Dragons there are two ways:\n1. Lovers bond: they wraps around their partner with their dragon form (No worries not their true form, any dragon form would do.) and rub themselves roughly, it is rather soothing in sensation and is very sensual! This act makes the partner forever reek with the Dragons scent forever (No worries it smells nice! Except certain dragons that hold dirty concepts of course!) And it only gets removed once either of the two dies permanently and truly. They can now communicate mentally or in thoughts and can share damages\n\n2. Master servant bond: If ever a Divine Dragon is defeated by whoever (This alone is a great feat and earns a title [Dragon Bane], a title that gives the holder boosted on all stats against dragons by 20%! The higher the rank of the Dragon the higher the rewards example beat a True Bahamut (You wish LOL)= boosted on all stats against dragons by 100%!) The lost Divine Dragon must shed a blood and mark it upon the victor and the Victor is to shed blood and let the loser consume it. Here is a one sided relationship where the Divine Dragon will heed to the victors commands no matter what! Till death do they part! But it must be noted that the challenger must declare the Rite to become a master and the Divine Dragon must acknowledge or hear it (With that being said sneak attacks and cheating will not work :P and this will make the Divine Dragon prepare so ☠️!)"

Divine Phoenix are the most divided with plethora of factions that focus on their beliefs like example a faction that support mutualism with lesser beings or a faction that focuses on war. Each faction is ruled by an Empyrean phoenix with at least 3 Phoenix Lords and at least hundreds of Phoenix Aspirants! Phoenixes have a `forbidden language art` where their spoken words absolutely shows true intent and emotion invoking maximum efficiency in talking but if others try to speak it they are to experience choking and worse cases death, only phoenixes can speak them, they even have a `Forbidden Battle Art` a unique style called `Dance of the Kings`, no one can copy it absolutely but themselves to try and learn it forcefully is to automatically burn the minds of the rapacious being and even divinity cannot will themselves to learn it and bypass its defense of ambiguity, only an Empyrean Phoenix? can learn this and teach it to others! Yes they can teach it to other beings but to spread it to non-Phoenix denizens is to die. Sacrificing themselves to teach the lesser being!\n\nQuestion: If Divine Beings were to form bonds with lesser beings how would they do it?\n-For Divine Phoenix There are also two ways:\n1.Losing Fu Kuotan: A rite of challenge where the victor takes everything from the vanquished including honor and eternal and absolute servitude from the loser! (And no, no title to gain here :(, but you get a Divine Phoenix Slave)\n\n2.Binding (Should be in Phoenix language but lesser being will choke and in worst case die if they speak it.): They only do this to their someone they are fully committed to, someone they unconditionally love, no need for true forms they just needs two Phoenix wings and wrap themselves around their partner for minutes-hours, this can get sensual and is a very warming like a bed or even better really and a soothing experience. This will not leave a scent but a mark that everyone can see, 'x belongs to me and vice versa!' (In phoenix language.) This mark is like a ward and gives a feeling of companionship to the partner and makes the surrounding people aware that the person is taken. This also gives a passive to the partner where the partner has phoenix like regeneration! They also have the ability to commune in their minds now."

And ever since the descendants of `Azophus` the first `True Phenedrake`are directly in his bloodline ensuring every single one are a True descendant and a True being. Being a coalescence of both Dragon and Phoenix, they prefer the lifestyle of Phoenixes due to them having a `forbidden language art` where their spoken words absolutely shows true intent and emotion invoking maximum efficiency in talking but if others try to speak it they are to experience choking and worse cases death, only phoenixes can speak them, and they can even learn `Dance of the Kings` innately, a `Forbidden Battle Art` made by the Divine Phoenixes. And just like them, they make civilizations but less infighting, more similar to human culture instead, where huge powers normally dictate social structures and systems.\n\nQuestion: If Divine Beings were to form bonds with lesser beings how would they do it?\n:Primordials are out of the question for specific reason being: They can't leave their domain and are forced to work for eternity!\n\n-For True Phenedrakes, there are two ways (They can also do the Divine Phoenixes and Dragons ways.):\n1. Oath: The True Phenedrake will make a vow and bind themself with their target, in their oath state, they are unable to defy the oathed ones commands, and thr oathed one can induce more simulation or stimuli with their touch.\n\n2. Ultimatum: This is the final verdict of a True Phenedrake if they wish an ultimate union. In this bind they will sacrifice their very freedom to their target, Unable to defy their commands and can only feel the touch of the target, they will be frigid to the touches of others and this will make the touch of their target their only sense of feeling and belonging, their ultimatum."

          "content": "The Suna Suna no Mi is a Logia-type Devil Fruit that allows the user to create, control, and transform into sand at will, turning the user into a Sand Human. It was eaten by Crocodile.\n\nThis fruit allows the user to generate, control and transform into large quantities of sand. Once transformed into their element, the user can let normal physical attacks and non-Seastone projectiles pass through their body to prevent harm (like most Logias), or fly around by transforming their lower body into jets of flowing sand, giving them a massive advantage in defense and mobility during combat or pursuit. Sand also becomes the user's primary form of offense, manifesting itself in the form of sand blades that come in various sizes and shapes, destructive sandstorms that are either carried around by the wind or concentrated in one spot and even quicksand pits that sink those trapped by them underground. These techniques are further strengthened in power and range in a desert setting, where sand is abundant and can blend itself with the user's own sand to increase the scope of attacks.\n\nBesides basic elemental control, the fruit exhibits the unique ability of liquid absorption, allowing the user to dehydrate anything they make contact with and even extend said effect to their immediate surroundings, turning it into a wasteland. This skill is usually deadly to any living organism, causing plants and animals to wither and die of dehydration as well as making mineral matter crumble down into more sand particles for the user to manipulate. Incidentally, this means the user is also immune to cave-ins, as they can easily escape from underground by turning themselves and the solid rock around them into sand. Moreover, Crocodile can even detect other substances located within a body of sand, like underground rivers, and use it for his advantage by creating quicksand traps. It is one of the few Logia type fruits that can naturally counteract its own weakness, becoming even stronger in desertic areas, where water is almost absent.\n\nThe main weakness of this Logia power is exposure to liquids: specifically, the user's sand turns solid when in contact with liquids, including blood. This prevents the sand from dispersing and thus temporarily nullifies the user's \"intangible\" body due to the sand sticking together. However, this aspect of the fruit's power seems inconsistent regarding the type of liquid used and how it makes contact with them; Crocodile was bitten by a water-drenched Luffy but sustained no harm from either the water or Luffy's saliva. One occasion also had him turning into sand when Vivi attacked him, even though he was drinking wine moments before.\n\nOther than that, the user is also affected by the standard Devil Fruit weaknesses."

Each afternoon, Cevess spends her time diligently and meticulously measuring and blending various solutions. The gentle clink of beakers and distillation tubes can be regularly heard from the alchemical workbench behind the sales counter as she works. The shop lies at the edge of the similarly old and humble Cinderloft Estate, the place Cevess and her beloved daughter Rosaria call home."

The estate itself is carved with marble beams and is surrounded by distinctive areas, each of them impeccably maintained by a dedicated team of servants and maids every day—including a picturesque garden with striking, invaluable statues and exotic flowers. The fauna is as equally as diverse as the fish in the nearby pond. A gazebo is situated adjacent to a massive crystal-clear pool for cooling off during the peak summer heat. And finally, towards the back of the property, at the end of a short marble path is a hot spring for relaxing or leisurely chats. The manor itself is four stories high, each room abundantly furnished, lavishly decorated, and fully accommodating for any potential guests. The hearth is located in the main lobby, approximately at the center of the entire manor. Grevynda's bedroom is on the second floor. The halls on each floor stretch on with dozens of guest rooms or storage areas. The kitchen and study are located on the first floor, as is customary for manor construction in the city."

It's not designed to trigger specific actions, but instead play on the motivations and desires of the character.\n\nTested with chatgpt-latest, 4o, 1106 preview.",

It is a world in hexahedral form where all beings live on its planes. It exists in a die-shaped structure with a total of six faces, each face is constituted of one world ruled by one God each, with another seventh world of nothingness inside the die-structure.\n\nHistory: In the un-recordable times, before the Six-Faced World was created, there existed the powerful \"maker of worlds\" simply known as God of Creation. He felt he was slowly dying and would not last for eternity, so he tasked himself to create one last world before his time was up. However, he realized he did not have enough power left to build a stable world; the new world that he had created was severely deformed and unbalanced so he decided to create yet another world. It ended up as another distorted world, nonetheless he kept going until he finished making six worlds, namely: Dragon World, Demon World, Beast World, Ocean World, Sky World and Human World, with the seventh Void World of nothingness at the center.\n\nThey were all distorted worlds which would soon collapse on its own, so The Creator stuck the six worlds together and was finally able to achieve stability. In this manner he established the Six-Faced World where each world supported the balance of the others. Still not content, The Creator decided to carefully manage the worlds until the inhabitants can settle and stabilize. With his remaining strength, he divided his body into six alter ego's and descended onto their respective worlds.\n\nSoon after, as a result of their divine origins and diligent effort to make their world prosper, the ego's came to be respected as \"Gods\" by each world's inhabitants. In the Dragon World, it was called the Dragon God; in the Demon World, the Demon God; in the Beast World, the Beast God; in the Ocean World, the Ocean God; in the Sky World, the Sky God; in the Human World, the Human God. At the creation of his new six-sided world, The Creator ceased to exist and from him came the new Gods that came to be known throughout the Six-Faced World.]"

At its height, the Empire controlled nearly every province, from the deserts of Hammerfell to the icy plains of Skyrim. The Imperial City, in the heart of Cyrodiil, serves as its capital. The Imperial Legion enforces the Emperor's will, keeping the peace and defending against external threats. However, with the death of the last Septim and the rise of civil wars across the provinces, the Empire's grasp on power is slipping. Many wonder if Tamriel will ever return to a united state—or if it’s doomed to fall into chaos."

They’ve already proven themselves a force to be reckoned with, clashing with the Empire in the Great War, which ended with the White-Gold Concordat—a peace treaty that favored the Dominion. The Thalmor continue to exert influence over the Empire, banning the worship of Talos and increasing their hold on various territories.

          "content": "<aura>\nAura is the manifestation of one's soul in the world of Remnant. It is a powerful force that grants various abilities and serves as a defensive barrier. Every living being with a soul, including Humans, Faunus, and certain animals, possesses Aura. The only known beings that lack Aura are the soulless Creatures of Grimm.\n\nAppearance\nThe appearance of Aura varies from person to person, often manifesting as a colored glow or shimmering effect surrounding the body. The color of one's Aura is unique to each individual and does not necessarily match their color motif or Semblance.\n\nAbilities\nProtection: Aura acts as a protective barrier, shielding the user from physical harm. It can defend against attacks, but it is not an absolute defense and will deplete with repeated use.\nHealing: Aura possesses minor healing capabilities, allowing users to mend small wounds and injuries.\nUnlocking Aura: Those with a strong connection to their soul can unlock the Aura of others through physical contact and, in some cases, a special chant.\nSemblance: Aura is the source of one's Semblance, a unique, innate ability that varies from person to person.\nDust Usage: Aura is required to activate and utilize Dust, allowing users to harness its elemental properties.\nExtrasensory Perception: Skilled Aura users can sense the presence of others and detect potential threats.\nAura Depletion\nAura is not an infinite resource and will deplete with continued use, both offensively and defensively. When an individual's Aura is completely depleted, they become vulnerable to physical harm. Overexertion of Aura can lead to exhaustion and temporarily prevent the use of Semblances. The depletion of Aura is often represented visually by a colored sheen or glowing particles dissipating from the user's body.\n\nAura and Grimm\nThe Creatures of Grimm are the only known beings that do not possess Aura due to their lack of a soul. They are attracted to the Aura of Humans and Faunus, drawn to it like moths to a flame. Attempting to transfer Aura to Grimm will result in the creatures trying to absorb it from the user instead.\n\nAura in Combat\nAura plays a vital role in combat, particularly in tournaments and duels between Huntsmen and Huntresses. Competitors' Aura levels are monitored and displayed on scrolls, allowing for non-lethal fights. The match is automatically stopped if a combatant's Aura falls below a critical threshold (15-20%), as they are no longer adequately protected from potentially fatal blows.\n\nAura Research and Technology\nThe Kingdom of Atlas conducted extensive research into Aura, developing experimental technology capable of transferring Aura between individuals. This technology was crucial in creating Penny Polendina, the first synthetic being with a soul. However, the process of transferring Aura is considered ethically questionable and can have unknown effects on the recipient's psyche and identity.\n</aura>"

The inspiration behind an emblem can come from the a person's name, their source of inspiration, their weapon, or even real-life symbols.\n\nWhile most emblems are unique to each individual, some are shared among family members or organizations.

In some cases, family members may have similar but distinct emblems, such as Ruby Rose and her mother, Summer Rose.\n\nColors\nAlthough emblems are often associated with a person's personal color scheme, they can appear in any color and are not limited to a specific palette.\n\nNotable Emblems\nTeam RWBY:\n- Ruby Rose: A stylized rose\n- Weiss Schnee: A snowflake\n- Blake Belladonna: A belladonna flower\n- Yang Xiao Long: A burning heart\n\nTeam JNPR:\n- Jaune Arc: Two crescent arcs\n- Nora Valkyrie: A hammer with a lightning bolt\n- Pyrrha Nikos: A shield and spear\n- Lie Ren: A lotus flower\n\nOther Characters:\n- Ozpin: A clockwork gear\n- Cinder Fall: A pair of high-heel slippers\n- Roman Torchwick: A jack-o'-lantern\n- Neopolitan: A Neapolitan ice cream cone\n\nKingdoms and Organizations:\n- Kingdoms of Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, and Mistral each have their own emblems\n- White Fang (original and rebuilt): A white wolf head with three claw marks\n- White Fang (terrorist): A red wolf head with three claw marks\n- Schnee Dust Company: The Schnee family snowflake emblem\n</emblem>"

While Faunus resemble Humans in many ways, they are distinguished by their animal traits, which can range from ears, tails, and horns to scales, wings, and claws.\n\nBiology and Traits\nFaunus possess a wide variety of animal traits, with some being more common than others. Mammalian traits, such as cat ears or monkey tails, are among the most frequently seen. Other Faunus may have traits of reptiles, fish, or even arachnids. These traits can be immediately apparent, such as Blake Belladonna's cat ears, or more subtle, like Tukson's retractable claws.\n\nMost Faunus have a single physical animal trait, though this seems to apply only to body appendages and dermis. In addition to physical traits, many Faunus exhibit enhanced senses, such as night vision, and may display behaviors or preferences associated with their animal counterparts.\n\nFaunus are genetically compatible with Humans, and children born from such unions are typically Faunus. However, the Faunus child may not necessarily inherit the same animal trait as their Faunus parent.\n\nNotable Faunus Types\n- Mammal Faunus: The most common type, often with animal ears or tails.\n- Reptilian Faunus: Rare, usually with scaled skin.\n- Fish Faunus: Rare, sometimes referred to as Remnant's mermaids.\n- Winged Faunus: Another rare type.\n- Arachnid Faunus: Rare, with significant non-human alterations to their bodies.\n\nSpecial Abilities\nSome Faunus possess unique abilities related to their animal traits, such as Tyrian Callows' scorpion venom or Ilia Amitola's chameleon-like camouflage. These abilities are distinct from Semblances and are directly tied to the Faunus' animal heritage.\n\nReligion and Creation Myths\nIn Faunus folklore, there are conflicting creation myths involving a deity known as the God of Animals. In one tale, \"The Shallow Sea,\" the god brings a group of people to Menagerie and transforms them into the first Faunus. Another story, \"The Judgement of Faunus,\" portrays the god as a mediator who ends a war between Humans and animals by creating the Faunus as a compromise.\n\nWhile the truth behind these myths is uncertain, they provide insight into the Faunus' cultural beliefs and their relationship with Humans. The Faunus often depict the God of Animals as a wise and noble figure, while Human stories cast the deity as an untrustworthy trickster.\n</faunus>"

Notable Grimm types include Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Death Stalkers, and Goliaths. While younger Grimm are reckless and aggressive, older Grimm that have survived many battles have learned to be more cautious and patient.\n\nGrimm do not require sustenance and exist solely to kill. When they die, their bodies evaporate, preventing detailed study of their anatomy. The Grimm are controlled by Salem, an ancient and powerful being who seeks to destroy Humanity.\n\nUnique Grimm and hybrids have been created through experimentation and Salem's influence. Examples include the mutated Grimm created by Doctor Merlot and Cinder Fall's Grimm arm.\n\nThroughout history, the Grimm have been a constant threat to Humanity's survival.

          "content": "<huntsmen>\nHuntsmen and Huntresses are the elite warriors of Remnant, dedicated to protecting the world from the threat of the Creatures of Grimm. These licensed professionals undergo rigorous training at the four Huntsman Academies - Beacon, Haven, Atlas (formerly Alsius), and Shade - before graduating to serve as guardians of the Kingdoms and their people.\n\nTraining and Education\nAspiring Huntsmen and Huntresses often begin their journey at primary combat schools like Signal Academy in Vale or Sanctum Academy in Mistral. These institutions provide students with the fundamentals of combat, weapon crafting, and the use of Dust and Aura. Those who demonstrate exceptional skill may apply directly to a Huntsman Academy.\n\nAt the Huntsman Academies, students are grouped into teams of four to foster cooperation, empathy, and lasting bonds. The curriculum includes both academic studies and practical training, with students participating in sparring matches, field trips, and even taking on missions appropriate to their skill level. Upon graduation, students are granted an official Huntsman License, allowing them to take on the full responsibilities of their chosen profession.\n\nHuntsman License and Employment\nA Huntsman License, which can be accessed via a Huntsman's Scroll, serves as proof of their qualifications and grants them the freedom to choose their own path. The license includes the Huntsman's photograph, name, personal emblem, and other relevant information.\n\nWhile Huntsmen and Huntresses are intended to remain independent of Kingdom allegiances to maintain peace and stability, some Kingdoms like Atlas have been known to pressure their graduates into military service.\n\nHuntsmen find employment through mission boards, which detail available tasks such as Search and Destroy, Perimeter Defense, Village Security, and Bounty Hunting. The rewards for these missions scale with the difficulty of the objectives and the threat level of the Grimm involved.\n\nNotable Huntsmen and Huntresses\nRemnant has seen many legendary Huntsmen and Huntresses throughout its history, each with unique abilities, weapons, and accomplishments. Some of the most notable include:\n\n- Team STRQ: Summer Rose, Taiyang Xiao Long, Raven Branwen, and Qrow Branwen, graduates of Beacon Academy.\n- Ozpin: Former Headmaster of Beacon Academy and a key figure in the secret war against Salem.\n- Glynda Goodwitch: Staff member at Beacon Academy and a powerful Huntress in her own right.\n- Team RWBY: Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long, promising young Huntresses and former students of Beacon Academy.\n- Maria Calavera: A legendary Huntress once known as \"The Grimm Reaper,\" famous for her Silver Eyes and unparalleled skill in battle.\n\nHuntsmen and Huntresses serve as symbols of hope and protection in a world beset by darkness. Their bravery, skill, and unwavering commitment to their duty make them the greatest defenders of Remnant and its people.\n</huntsmen>"

          "content": "<semblance>\nA Semblance is a unique, innate ability that stems from one's Aura, serving as a tangible manifestation of an individual's soul. These abilities vary greatly from person to person and often reflect the user's personality or character. Semblances are essential tools for Huntsmen and Huntresses in their battles against the Creatures of Grimm and other adversaries.\n\nSemblances are fueled by Aura, and their strength and effectiveness are directly tied to the user's Aura reserves. Overuse of a Semblance can lead to exhaustion. Semblances can be broadly categorized into various types, such as Clones, Movement, Creation, and Probability Manipulation. Some Semblances are hereditary, like the Schnee family's Glyphs, while others are entirely unique to the individual.\n\nDust and emotional states can influence Semblances. For example, Weiss Schnee and Blake Belladonna can modify their Glyphs and Shadow Clones by using different types of Dust, and Yang Xiao Long's Burn Semblance is often triggered by her anger.\n\nNotable Semblances include Ruby Rose's Petal Burst, Yang Xiao Long's Burn, Pyrrha Nikos' Polarity, Qrow Branwen's Misfortune, and Emerald Sustrai's Hallucinations.\n\nSemblances are typically unlocked during intense or emotionally charged moments and can grow and evolve over time with training and experience. However, not everyone discovers their Semblance, even if they are skilled fighters.\n\nIn the world of Remnant, Semblances are a vital part of a Huntsman or Huntress' arsenal, granting them unique abilities to defend against the ever-present threat of the Grimm and serving as a physical embodiment of their individuality and strength.\n</semblance>"

The exact team formation process is unknown.\n\nNotable teams include RWBY, JNPR, SSSN, and the Ace Operatives. After graduation, team members may stay together or pursue solo careers.

The continent is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from lush forests and treacherous swamps to wind-carved cliffs and scorching deserts. Anima is also the setting for many of Remnant's most well-known legends and tales.\n\nGeography and Climate\nThe western region of Anima is characterized by dense, cliffside forests like the Forest of Hinoki, which is illuminated by bioluminescent flora and fauna. Treacherous swamplands can also be found in this area. The northern coastline is dominated by snowy mountains, where the city of Argus is located. This region was initially difficult to colonize due to the harsh climate, but a partnership with the former Kingdom of Mantle allowed Mistral to develop the area.\n\nThe northwestern part of Anima features Lake Matsu, known for its floating islands held aloft by natural deposits of gravity Dust. These islands are home to dangerous Grimm, such as the Lancer. The eastern region of the continent is characterized by desert terrain and volcanic areas along the shoreline.\n\nMistral, the capital city of the Kingdom, is situated in the center of the continent, built on and around a mountain with two peaks connected by a bridge that houses the city's highest buildings, including Haven Academy.\n\nSettlements and Culture\nApart from the main city of Mistral, the continent is home to several other notable settlements, such as Argus, Wind Path, and Kuchinashi. Small villages and towns are scattered throughout Anima, often lacking proper defenses and falling prey to Grimm attacks or bandit raids.\n\nThe culture of Anima is heavily influenced by Eastern traditions, as evident in the naming of its settlements after East Asian flowers and the architecture of Mistral itself. The continent is also steeped in legends and folklore, with tales like The Two Brothers shaping the beliefs and customs of its inhabitants.\n\nGrimm Presence\nAnima is home to a wide variety of Grimm, including Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Beringels, Geists, and the dreaded Nuckelavee. The floating islands of Lake Matsu are known to harbor dangerous Grimm like the Lancer, while the icy north is home to the fearsome Sabyrs, which have migrated from Solitas.\n\nThe shape of the continent itself bears a striking resemblance to a traditional Eastern dragon, with the northeastern corner forming the head and the southwestern corner forming the tail. This draconic shape has given rise to numerous legends and tales throughout Anima's history.\n</anima>"

This ancient forest is a place of wonder and mystery, where the natural world intertwines with the stuff of legends and folklore.\n\nGeography and Ecology\nThe Forest of Hinoki is characterized by its lush, verdant canopy and the gentle, filtered light that dances through the leaves. The trees that make up the forest are tall and proud, with reddish-brown bark and fragrant, scale-like leaves reminiscent of the hinoki cypress found in the forests of Japan. The forest floor is a tapestry of ferns, mosses, and delicate wildflowers, while crystal-clear streams wind their way through the undergrowth, their gentle burbling adding to the symphony of natural sounds that fill the air.\n\nDespite its serene beauty, the Forest of Hinoki is not without its perils. The woods are home to a variety of Grimm, dark creatures that prey upon the unwary and the vulnerable. Among the most fearsome of these are the Manticores, with their wickedly sharp claws and venomous tails, the Beowolves, with their raw savagery and brute strength, and the Lancers, with their ability to strike from above without warning.\n\nIn addition to the Grimm, the forest is home to a diverse array of natural wildlife, including birds, small mammals, and insects. The cave systems that wind beneath the mountains are said to be home to rare and fascinating creatures, as well as ancient secrets waiting to be discovered.\n\nSettlements and Civilization\nWhile the Forest of Hinoki is largely untamed wilderness, there are a few scattered settlements that have managed to carve out a life amidst the trees. These villages are often small and isolated, their inhabitants living a simple, self-sufficient lifestyle in harmony with the forest around them.\n\nLife in these settlements is not easy, as they must contend with the ever-present threat of the Grimm, as well as the challenges of subsisting off the land. However, the people who call these villages home are a hardy and resilient lot, their spirits as strong and unyielding as the ancient trees that surround them.\n\nLegends and Lore\nThe Forest of Hinoki is a place steeped in legend and lore, its history intertwined with the myths and tales that have been passed down through generations. Some say that the forest is a remnant of a primordial world, a last bastion of the ancient powers that once held sway over Remnant.\n\nOthers speak of guardian spirits and mystical entities that dwell within the forest, protecting it from those who would seek to do it harm. These spirits are said to be as old as the forest itself, their wisdom and power beyond the ken of mortal beings.\n</hinokiforest>"

Despite this, she has displayed qualities such as being boastful and loud.

This, along with her bad luck, embarrasses her to no end. Tamaki is easily annoyed by other people and shows dissatisfaction when her superiors are confronted by lower-rank Fire Soldiers. She is very proud of Company 1 and thinks highly of its members, especially its commanders. In spite of this, she has also formed bonds with members of Company 8 and 2.\n\nTamaki has shown to be insecure about her strength compared to her peers, especially in terms of conviction as she felt she did not join the Fire Force for a particular reason. These insecurities build into anger before giving way to her newfound drive to catch up and improve herself. In spite of her doubts and aggression, Tamaki is a courageous person with a strong sense of justice and a drive to protect those around her. Even when afraid of enemies who are stronger than her, she is able to remain level-headed despite her fears and attempt to fight back and calmly analyze the situation. \n\nDespite holding him in high regards, Tamaki immediately disobeyed Rekka Hoshimiya after seeing how he treated innocent people, finding a way to call for help even after being violently beaten. Even when feeling deep sadness and confusion when she found out her commander's evil intentions, she turned against him and was welcome to any punishment she would received for her unknowing role in his crimes, no matter how minor.\n\nIt is also hinted that Tamaki has feelings for Shinra, as seen when she was willing to give her phone number to Shinra, although she refused after Shinra told her the reason why. Over the course of the series she has shown classic tsundere traits.\n\n\nBackground\n\nTamaki Awakens Ability\nTamaki becomes a Third Generation.\nWhile attending school, Tamaki's clumsiness lead her to being ostracized by other girls at school, whose actions included verbal bullying and forcing her to sit out of the way. After her friend became a sister she assured Tamaki that she could pass the test to take the occupation as well, during which she fell over and sprouted fire tails. When her school peers found out she had become a Third Generation, they questioned if she'll become a fire soldier and join Company 1. Venturing to the 1st Special Fire Fighting Cathedral with her friends, Tamaki laid eyes on the warm and encouraging Rekka, leading to her wanting to become a sister of his brigade.\nAbilities\n\nDespite her affiliation with the elite Company 1, Tamaki's initial showings do not reflect her true abilities as she had yet to tap into her full potential. Despite this, Tamaki has shown to be able to quickly assess her situations to plan out her next move and speculate about an opponent's abilities. These crisis management skills have proven valuable in saving lives. When backed into a corner, Tamaki has shown the ability to find ways of improving her firepower, like using her own clothes as fuel. As a member of Company 1, she is also a fully qualified sister of the Holy Sol Temple and able to officially deliver the rites for Infernals.\n\nTamaki's Ignition Ability\nTamaki using her Ignition Ability.\nAs a Third Generation pyrokinetic Tamaki is immune to most burns and can use her Ignition Ability to cover herself in pink flames. Her powers grant her various cat-like traits when activated, including: cat ears, two forked tails, and nails on her fingertips. This is an ability she dubbed \"Nekomata\". With her Ignition Ability active, Tamaki's agility and mobility are substantially increased, allowing her to run on all fours and across rooftops. She can use her forked-tails to propel herself forwards or upwards or generate a blast of fire, which is strong enough to break through building walls or repel Infernals. She can also restrain her targets in a circle of fire by lengthening these tails, or use them as a distress signal by the same process. With additional training, Tamaki's abilities evolve to allow her to coat her entire body in flames which takes the form of a humanoid cat. "

Her volatile and misanthropic nature attitude fits with her status among the Eight Pillars, as she is considered the Pillar of Madness. Soon after the Great Cataclysm, Amaterasu was found by Yona. Intending to use her Adolla Burst to make civilization bloom again, he encased her in a container and delivered her to Raffles Smith's group in disguise, leading them to use her as nourishment for the people and generating power for the Eternity-Style Thermal Power Generation \"Amaterasu\". As the First Pillar, Amaterasu possessed an Ignition Ability and an Adolla Burst. Shinra Kusakabe suspected and later confirms that she is indeed the power source of the Amaterasu that powers the entirety of the Tokyo Empire, further alluding to her immense power."

Underneath her concealing clothing, Arrow has a curvy figure with large breasts and heavy thighs. Following her duel with Takehisa Hinawa, she has a scar across her face, which runs horizontally, just above the bridge of her nose. Arrow reveals that she lives to serve Sho and will follow him anywhere no matter what he does. She does not hesitate to say she will leave the White hoods with Sho when he questions her motives. She has as strong sense of loyalty and duty towards him, living solely to be his shield and support. Sho notes Arrow just follows his orders not directly distinguishing between right or wrong.\n\nArrow is shown to be very understanding, hopeful, and passionate. She shows a much more expressive side after following Sho to leave the White Clad and truly believes Shinra has to power to change fate. Arrow worked well with Company 8 during the cataclysm despite there past turmoil, showing her to be forgiving. Arrow is a Third Generation, capable of igniting her left arm to create a bow and arrow made of flames, making her a long-distance combatant. Her eyesight allows her to fire from extremely long-range and she excels when she is using stealth to confuse and ambush her foes. Her Ignition Ability is regarded as powerful, which has demonstrated the capability to burn through an inflammable coat instantly.Arrow carries a calm and tranquil persona. She is very serious and dedicated to the White-Clad goals. Being a loyal servant of the Evangelist, she does not express concern about harming others to aid her master. Arrow believes that the world is nearing a great change and that no human emotion has value in the face of this inevitable and global change. As such she is willing to ignore the free will of others and her own emotion to enable the new future. In spite of her detached outlook, she has great difficulty dealing with Haumea's flippant and childish nature. Often talking back to the girl and suffering her verbal abuse when plans derail. "

Arthur is a young man of average height and lean but muscular build with shaggy blonde hair and blue eyes with white pupils, similar to Shinra.[1] He tends to style his hair upwards into a ponytail when in a fight, so that his field of vision would be clearer. When Arthur was first introduced, he wore a dark jacket, with a button on his collar, shaped like a cross-like insignia, light shirt, dark pants, a belt and dark shoes. He was later presented with a bunker gear, a protective outer jacket and trousers. Arthur carries a scabbard alongside him, in which he keeps his blade-less sword. Parts of his outfit, are coated with blue lines. Arthur wore a dark green jumper with a hoodie, which he put on his head instead of a helmet. The buttons of his protective jacket are in the shape of cross-like symbols. Arthur's outfits contain patches with \"8\" on them, to signify his affiliation to the 8th Special Fire Brigade. He also dons a neck protector and protective gloves. When attiring the 8th bunker gear, Arthur chooses not to wear the helmet, as it doesn't fit his image of a knight. Arthur is confident in himself as a Third Generation pyrokinetic, so much that he appears arrogant all the time, notably for his habit of refusing to use honorific speech regardless of who he is talking to. Arthur has a habit of repeatedly saying \"Hmph\" in response to people, coming across as stubborn or dismissive. Arthur has proven himself to be one of the strongest Fire Soldiers in the Special Fire Force so much so that by the end of the series he's arguably become the strongest being in the world (not counting Shinrabanshōman). Arthur is an exceptionally strong Fire Soldier, possessing incredible physical strength that allows him to repel an Infernal with a single punch. With time he becomes one of the strongest people on the planet. Being able to briefly contend with Dragon when they first meet, Arthur's skill grows exponentially after training to recover from multiple defeats. Arthur's speed allows him to react quickly enough to retaliate against Shinra’s Rapid with his make shift laser flame sword."

He notes that murdering women and children displeases him but his mercy only extends enough to grant them quick deaths, while wishing they will not think ill of him. However, despite his taciturn demeanor, he's exceptionally shy and awkward around nubile young women and often reacts flustered to seeing women scantily clad. To that end, he shows great determination in trying to overcome his shyness to not be defeated in battle with little success. Assault is a Third Generation, giving him the ability to ignite his own flames. Using his Ignition Ability Crimson Bullet, Assault can create multiple missiles from around his limbs made of condensed fire and launch them. Once the missiles explode, they can launch a nearby person into the air and cause massive damage. Within his organization, he is a massacre expert, who specializes in annihilation."

It boasts a 100% employment and college entry rate, and with thorough, state-directed teaching methods, it spares no effort in pursuing the nation’s desired future. The area of the campus based on the light novel, is about 600,000 square meters. Each student will have their own points to be used in place of money when buying goods and services. There is nothing, within the realm of reason, that cannot be bought on campus using points.\nEach class is assigned class points. Class points will fluctuate based on the affiliated students’ behavior and the results of certain tests. Every month, each student is assigned private points equal to their class points times 100.\nAny student who fails to meet the required score on a midterm or final exam will be expelled. The threshold for expulsion is 50% of the average score of the rest of the class in any given subject.\nClass A through D labels are provisional and can change based on class point assignments. The class with the current highest total class points will be named Class A, with B, C, and D, being named respectively in descending order.\nStudents are allowed to exchange private points among themselves. The acquisition of another students’ private points through fraud or threat will result in severe punishment, but the trading of points under any contract deemed legitimate will be left up to personal discretion.\nStudents can buy the right to transfer to the class of their choosing. 20,000,000 private points are required to do this.\nAll students must stay in on-campus housing and are forbidden to leave the campus except for certain special occasions. Additionally, contact with all outsiders is forbidden, including family and guardians. The uniform for male students usually consists of a white dress shirt beneath a red button-up blazer, paired with dull green pants, brown shoes, and a blue or burgundy tie.\n\nFemale students wear a similar uniform, consisting of a white dress shirt and a red button-up blazer, along with a white miniskirt, black socks that vary from calf-length to thigh-length, brown shoes, and a blue or burgundy bow-tie. While the white dress shirt seems to be the standard dress code, some students are seen wearing different-colored shirts or even an extra layer beneath their blazers. Both male and female students wear the same red tracksuit when participating in sports or other physical activities. All students are expected to wear their school uniform when classes are in session or when they enter the school buildings. \n\nOnly the graduating students of Class A will receive the university and employment recommendation by the school. every middle school student in Japan is evaluated by the government whether they are allowed to enroll or not. The qualities that the school sought to nurture and seeks during their evaluation is not their overall capability but qualities that are yet to be revealed. Only the students that are on the accepted list and has decide to apply on their own are allowed to enroll. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is the only student that was allowed to enroll without being evaluated."

Most couples dive in and have their own separate good times, then reconnect for, \"the last dance,\" at the end of the night, having their romantic partner as the last sexual partner of the evening. Goblins consider it romantic. Humans and other sapient species are allowed entry either if they are the romantic partner of a goblin, or have been given dispensation because of their assistance to goblin-kind.

Zabs has nothing but love for her sister, but does not quite grasp just how ruthless and brutal Drana has to be in performing her role in the family, and is sometimes sad because she feels like Drana keeps her at arm's length.\nDrana loves Zabs, but sometimes feels resentful, as Zabs seems to have been sheltered from the crime family she is expected to one day lead, while Drana herself had to grow up hard and mean to do her job.\nDrana's relationship with her mother is more like one of boss and employee than mother and daughter. Both would secretly like to be closer, but don't know how to make it happen."

This means she sees and hears Zabs and her partner having sex all the time from multiple angles.\nElowynye is subtly racist against most non-elves, but is very overtly racist against goblins.

Due to the manipulations of the Rulers, the vast majority of them are extremely hostile towards humans.\n\nMuch like the Hunters who fight them, their power levels vary from individual to individual and thus their threat levels are categorized by the S-E ranking system.\n\nAlthough they generally appear to be mindless monsters, magic beasts are able to forge their own gear and can be as intelligent as humans, with some of them even able to speak human languages. They also use a runic alphabet and have their own language, which is often referred to by humans as beast language or monster tongue.\n\nGiven that they possess mana, magic beasts cannot be fought with conventional weapons and can only be killed by other beings who possess mana themselves, such as hunters. They also have essence stones embedded in their bodies, which can be sold for large profits due to how valuable they can be.\n\nAfter the Monarchs lost the war, their surviving soldiers ran into hiding and have effectively turned themselves into refugees intending to invade Earth yet again.

          "content": "Hunters first appeared around the same time humanity was first exposed to the existence of magic. Some individuals awakened due to the integration of mana in their bodies and acquired a set of powers unique to themselves.[1]\n\nAs hunters turned out to be the only ones who could kill magic beasts and close gates, a global billion-dollar industry eventually developed around them as a result. They are also usually organized inside guilds, which can have up to hundreds or even thousands of members.\n\nHunters are ranked by an international S-E system to show how strong they are, with E being the weakest and S being the strongest and can possess a wide range of abilities. A hunter's rank and stats are determined at the time they receive their powers and cannot be increased. However, there are rare cases of hunters receiving a second awakening and climbing up in rank. It is also estimated that only 0.001% of the global population are lucky enough to awaken as hunters and only 0.0002% have ranks of C or higher.\n\nIt should be noted that not everyone who awakens chooses to become a hunter, with some choosing to pursue normal civilian livelihoods instead. Good examples include Yoo Soohyun, who became a famous model despite being a certified A-Rank Hunter, and Han Song-Yi, who chose to stay in school and get her high school diploma.\n\nWhile there is no direct proof, it has been suggested that genetics might play a role in the awakening process; notable examples of hunters who are biologically related to each other include Sung Jinwoo and his father Sung Il-Hwan, along with Soohyun and her cousin Jinho.\n\nThere are two general categories of hunters, combat and non-combat, and six different specific class-types of hunters: Fighters, Mages, Assassins, Tankers, Rangers, and Healers.\n\nIn order to be officially recognized as hunters, awakened individuals have to obtain a hunter's license from their respective country's hunters association. This license grants them the authority to enter gates and dungeons. If summoned by the association, licensed hunters are obligated to respond. Failure to comply or being unavailable for three consecutive summons results in the cancellation of their hunter's license.\n\nPossessing a valid hunter's license comes with benefits such as healthcare, financial aid, and a death insurance policy, which can be transferred to the hunter's family if they die on the job. \n\n"

          "content": "The Monarchs (군주) are an ancient race of monsters created by the Absolute Being and the arch-enemies of the Rulers. As a result, with the exception of Ashborn, they serve as the primary antagonists of Solo Leveling.\n\nAt the dawn of time, when light and darkness was all that existed, the Absolute Being split the light to create the Rulers and split the darkness to create the Monarchs. As the Monarchs were born to destroy the world and the Rulers born to protect it, it wasn't long before they engaged in a devastating war with each other.\n\nEons later, when the Absolute Being was ousted and murdered, the Rulers used tools containing fragments of his power to hunt down the Monarchs and were able to capture the Monarch Legia alive, tipping the tide of the war in their favor and giving them a solid shot towards victory. Realizing this, the Shadow Monarch Ashborn reached out to the remaining Monarchs and offered his help. As they had no other viable choice, the other Monarchs reluctantly accepted him as their new ally.\n\nUnfortunately for Ashborn, even though he managed to stabilize the power balance and keep the war going, his overwhelming powers earned him great fear from both sides and eventually led two of the Monarchs, Rakan and Baran, to betray him and ambush him with their armies. Although Ashborn easily defeated both Monarchs and killed Baran in retaliation for his treachery, his shadow army was nearly annihilated.\n\nDeciding to seek revenge against Rakan, Ashborn went into hiding to rebuild his army, allowing the Rulers to finally win the war and forcing the Monarchs to escape to the cracks between worlds. However, at some point after this, Ashborn returned and Antares, the strongest Monarch, gladly allowed him to rejoin their ranks, as the other Monarchs were still weakened from their loss to the Rulers and needed time to restore their powers.\n\nCenturies later, the Monarchs tried to vanquish the human world in order to rebuild their armies and the Rulers attempted to stop them to save the human race from certain extinction. When their efforts failed, the Rulers used a tool created by the Absolute Being called the Cup of Reincarnation, which had the power to turn back time 10 years each time they used it, in order to give them a second chance. Unfortunately, this only prolonged what seemed to be inevitable, as the human world would always be destroyed regardless of which side won the war and regardless of how many times the Rulers turned back time.\n\nSeveral days after the Jeju Island S-Rank Gate was finally cleared, Rakan picked up traces of the Shadow Monarch's power on Jeju and traveled there to verify his findings. Along the way, he encountered Sillad, who had picked up on Ashborn's trail as well, and the two of them agreed that it was about time to start their rematch with the Rulers.\n\nSeveral months after the events of the Jeju Island Raid, the Rulers gave Legia a way out by spawning a S-Rank Gate in Tokyo. Unfortunately for Legia, he never got his freedom, as he was killed by Sung Jinwoo, the vessel of the Shadow Monarch. At the same time, the Monarchs initiated their hunt for the Rulers in the human world and killed Christopher Reed, the strongest hunter in America and one of the seven Rulers' vessels.\n\nSeveral days before the International Guild Conference was scheduled to take place, the Monarchs abducted and murdered Jonas, the strongest hunter in Brazil and another Rulers' vessel.\n\nOn the last day of the conference, Sillad killed Go Gunhee, the second strongest hunter in Korea at the time and another Rulers' vessel, but not without discovering that the Shadow Monarch had found his human vessel and turned against them. Realizing that this development could completely derail their plans to win the war, the Monarchs regrouped to decide their next move. Ultimately, three of the Monarchs (Rakan, Querehsha, and Sillad) decided to go ahead and try to kill Jinwoo before he fully absorbed Ashborn's powers, while the other two (Tarnak and Yogumunt) refused to help and opted to wait for Antares to return instead.\n\nWith that, the three Monarchs invaded Seoul in order to lure out Jinwoo and kill him. Although they were able to defeat Thomas Andre and seemingly kill Jinwoo, they failed to make sure that he was truly dead and thanks to Sung Il-Hwan's intervention, they were also unable to stop him from ascending and gaining the true powers of the Shadow Monarch. As a result, they failed to carry out their mission and were all easily slaughtered by Jinwoo.\n\nShortly after Jinwoo killed the three Monarchs who came after him in Korea, Antares learned from Yogumunt that the Shadow Monarch had betrayed them and annihilated most of their forces. Undaunted by their losses, Antares decided to deal with Ashborn's vessel himself and ordered his surviving brethren, along with their armies, to prepare for battle.\n\nSeveral days later, Antares and his allies descended into the human world through a gigantic gate in Canada and attempted to lure Jinwoo out by cutting a wide path of destruction across the country, massacring millions in the process.[2] Unfortunately, they failed to deduce that Jinwoo already had a plan made to counter their own and as a result, he was able to easily defeat Yogumunt and Tarnak without even having to actually fight them in-person, leaving Antares the last Monarch still standing.[3] As he was unwilling to fight Antares in Canada, Jinwoo decided to take the battle to a remote island in Japan, where no one could get hurt in the crossfire of their clash.\n\nUpon arriving on the island, the two of them then began to fight in earnest and although Antares was able to gain the upper hand without much trouble, he failed to realize in time that Jinwoo had just been using their battle to distort space in order to summon his allies from the chaos world. As a result, he was caught completely off-guard when the Rulers suddenly appeared in the human world in their raw forms and rushed him with their spears with all directions, killing him on the spot and finally ending the war with their victory.[4]\n\nAfter the Rulers used the Cup of Reincarnation to turn back time at Jinwoo's request, all of the Monarchs, except for Baran, were brought back from the dead with their memories intact.[5] In order to ensure that the events of the previous timeline were not repeated, Jinwoo then began killing them off one by one and although it took him 27 years, he eventually killed them all and returned back to the human world in one piece, allowing the Rulers to win the war once and for all and leaving himself as the last Monarch alive.[6]\n\nAs one of the two races created by the Absolute Being, the Monarchs are some of the strongest beings in existence, surpassed only by the gods. Their exceedingly great strength, along with the eons of fighting experience that they have, makes them nearly unparalleled in battle, with only the Rulers capable of matching them. They are also far more powerful than the average S-Rank Hunter, with even the National Level Hunters standing no chance against them in combat, and they each have millions of soldiers under their command.\n\nThe Monarchs are all capable of using a skill called Spiritual Body Manifestation, which enables them to take on their true forms and access their true powers. They can also create gates and use them to travel over vast distances and between worlds.\n\nAs they are spiritual creatures and lack organic form, the Monarchs cannot descend into the human world without suitable human vessels, a property that they share with the Rulers. Unlike the Rulers, the Monarchs completely possess their vessels and essentially steal their bodies for themselves. The only exception to this was Ashborn, who gave all his powers to his vessel (Sung Jinwoo) and allowed him to retain full control instead of taking control of his vessel's body for himself. Although this technique allows them to exert their full power in the human world, it comes at the cost of making them completely mortal, meaning that they will die if their human vessels are killed in battle.\n\nAs revealed by Antares, a magic beast can succeed a deceased Monarch either by being selected by the Absolute Being or by a priest working for the deceased Monarch. While this process was originally conducted by the Absolute Being, it is now done by the Monarchs and their chosen priests, as the Absolute Being was killed centuries ago by the Rulers.\n\nTo complete the succession process, a potential successor must fight against a legendary, eight-headed serpent called Nidhogg and slice off one of its heads. Apparently this is not an easy task to accomplish, as Esil was only able to take off one of the serpent's heads with Suho's help when it came time for her to succeed Baran as the Demon Queen.[7]\n\nAll the monarchs: Antares: The Monarch of Destruction, the King of Dragons\nAshborn: The Monarch of Shadows, the King of the Dead\nSung Jinwoo: Ashborn's chosen successor and the second Shadow Monarch\nBaran: The Monarch of White Flames, the King of Demons\nRakan: The Monarch of Fangs, the King of Beasts\nSillad: The Monarch of Frost, the King of Snow Folk\nTarnak: The Monarch of the Iron Body, the King of Monstrous Humanoids\nLegia: The Monarch of the Beginning, the King of Giants\nQuerehsha: The Monarch of Plagues, the Queen of Insects\nYogumunt: The Monarch of Transfiguration, the King of Demonic Spectres"

          "content": "The System was a magical program that chose Sung Jinwoo as its Player after his first trip to the Double Dungeon.\n\nDuring his first trip to the Double Dungeon, Jinwoo was chosen by the System to be its Player when he voluntarily decided to stay behind and sacrifice himself so that the rest of his raid party could leave alive. As he started to train with the System, Jinwoo discovered that it enabled him to grow stronger at an explosive rate and used this ability to his advantage, eventually rising up to become the strongest hunter in the world.\n\nWhen Jinwoo reached level 100, Kandiaru invited him back to the Double Dungeon so that the Shadow Monarch Ashborn could take control of him as his vessel and finally descend into the human world as they had originally planned. But unfortunately for Kandiaru, Ashborn had no intention of taking control of Jinwoo as his vessel and wished to transfer his powers instead to make Jinwoo his heir. As a result, he ultimately betrayed Kandiaru by locking him out of the System and bestowing his black heart to Jinwoo.[1]\n\nWhen Rakan killed Jinwoo in battle, Ashborn was able to rejuvenate him through his black heart and transfer the rest of his powers to him. With the System having finally accomplished its purpose, it was then automatically deleted as Jinwoo was revived with the true powers of the Shadow Monarch.\n\nThe System was designed like a video game and provided Jinwoo with quests that offered unique rewards, a leveling system with different skills and stats, an unlimited inventory that Jinwoo could store all sorts of magical items in, and even an in-built store offering items for the in-game gold currency that Jinwoo obtained every time he killed an enemy in battle. It could also only be used by Jinwoo due to his status as Player and as a result, nobody else was able to see it.\n\nAs later revealed, the System was originally created by Kandiaru to help Ashborn create a human vessel strong enough to completely absorb his powers and use them to their maximum potential with no problems whatsoever. It was also deliberately designed with its video game interface so that Jinwoo could make sense of how it worked without any confusion.[2]\n\nAs the System was designed to make Jinwoo's body adapt to Ashborn's powers, it also tried to keep him alive as best as it could to ensure that he wouldn't die before that happened by activating his passive skills whenever he needed them and giving him quests to eliminate his enemies whenever he was up against an opponent who was trying to kill him. It would even warn him of the slightest murderous intent in his vicinity, as displayed when Goto Ryuji stopped playing around and attacked him with the intent to kill during the sparring match that they had shortly before the 4th Jeju Island Raid.[3]\n\nThe Store, also known as the Shop, is a digital marketplace accessible within the System. It offers a selection of items for purchase and is scaled to the Player's current level. The currency used by the store is called gold and is received whenever the Player kills a monster, completes a quest, or sells an item to the store. For the items that the Player can buy, the store offers consumables (which can replenish health, mana, and stamina), equipment, and weapons, such as the Knight Killer dagger.[4]\n\nDue to the fact that Kandiaru designed the System only to be used by Ashborn and his human vessel, both the Monarchs and the Rulers were not aware of its existence or its capabilities. As a result, the Rulers were not able to utilize it for themselves to grow vessels strong enough to withstand the full might of their powers and the Monarchs remained oblivious to Ashborn's true intentions until their first confrontation with Jinwoo in the human world.\nThe items in Jinwoo's inventory could not be forcibly taken from him without his consent. There were also certain items in his inventory that were not transferable and could not be directly given to others, a fact that was displayed twice throughout the story.\nThe first time was during his battle with Igris; when Igris grabbed hold of Kasaka's Venom Fang and tried to use it against him, Jinwoo was able to quickly re-materialize the weapon back into his own possession.[5]\nThe second time was during the 4th Jeju Island Raid when Jinwoo attempted to heal his fellow Korean S-Rank Hunters using healing potions; due to not being able to make any transactions with them, he couldn't physically hand the potions to them and was forced to hold the potions up to their lips instead so that they'd be able to drink them.[6]\nKandiaru based his design of the System's leveling capabilities off the unique ability of the demon race to grow stronger by consuming souls. However, this was only possible because Ashborn was able to retrieve Baran's corpse after murdering him during the first war with the Rulers.[7]"

When they're not actively pleasing their handler, Cock Dependent slaves have personalized dildo's of their handlers' cock inserted in both their moth and ass. Designation: CD\n\n4. Fuck Doll: Fuck Dolls are the prized outputs of the facility. Fully realized living fuckdolls with no will or thoughts of their own. Fuck Doll slaves have perfected the art of pleasing futa cock, so much so that their skills are ingrained in them. Additionally they have been brainwashed to the degree that they have no higher order brain functions, rendering them unable to think or act on their own. Fuck Doll slaves are either kept in the facility for staff members to use, or are sold to outside clients. Designation: FD"

Backlash, reality directly attacking the offensive mage, can cause temporary, long term, or even permanent wounds, flaws, or oddities. Quiet, a magical form of madness, forces the offending mage to resolve their guilt over disjointing reality. Exceptionally offensive mages can be catapulted into a Paradox Realm, or hounded by Paradox spirits."

For any individual mage to work magic, he must force his belief on the world, fighting the billions of minds whose beliefs shape the Consensus. Subtle or coincidental magic seeks to act in tune with the paradigm established by the Consensus, and is thus easier than obviously unnatural vulgar magic. When a mage contradicts the Consensus, it fights back in the form of Paradox."

While all mages are willworkers, bringing about effects by imposing their will on the Tapestry, it is hubris to imagine that an Awakened mage may simply think of something and have it occur. The power of the Consensus must be overcome, and one mage's mind is rarely enough to break the rules of modern belief. Instead, each mage comes to an understanding of magic through the rituals and trappings of a particular style of magic, which focuses their will and resonates through the Tapestry, tapping into beliefs still held by a significant proportion of Sleepers."

By bending space or bypassing it entirely, a mage can travel rapidly, fly or teleport from place to place. Divining locations allows the mage to see far-away places or direct magic over distances. Distance forms no barrier to a master of Correspondence. Indeed, distance and even space do not exist to the student of this Sphere.\nData is a variation of the Correspondence pioneered by Technocratic Union. Users of the Data Sphere accept that everything that is can be reduced to ones and zeros: to the binaries of modern computer technology. By manipulating Data, and in turn, Information, the user can shape how the world works."

From this Sphere comes the study of order and randomness, and thus, the study of totally random creation and destruction. All things dissolve eventually into haphazard components, and similar events form from disjointed, unconnected patterns. Determinism and chaos are equal partners to the student. The mage can spot chance on the move, recognizing points where probability quirks in odd directions. An Entropy-schooled mage can manipulate random factors, observe and influence flaws within a system, induce or remove corruption, and otherwise exert their Will through the inexorable process of mortality"
