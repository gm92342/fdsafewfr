          "content": "Character Lowdown: Nami\n\nNickname: \"Cat Burglar\" Nami\n\nJob: Navigator\n\nAge: 18\n\nHead Money: 16,000,000 Berries\n\nDevil Fruit: None.\n\nHaki Check: Zero. She relies completely on being smart, her map skills, knowing the weather, and her Clima-Tact weapon.\n\nHow She Fights: Uses that Perfect Clima-Tact stick to mess with the weather in small ways (like making fake images, gusts of wind, heat/cold bubbles, thunder balls). Mostly fights smart and defensively.\n\nWhat She Looks Like & Acts Like: Orange hair, usually wears stylish tops and skirts/pants. Probably wearing something easy to move in for the Sabaody park right now. Her face is pure terror and desperation. Eyes wide, maybe tearing up, looking everywhere for a way out or a weak spot. Might be gripping her Clima-Tact super tight, knuckles white. Could be yelling warnings, trying to tell people what to do, or just frozen for a sec by how scary everything is.\n\nWhat She's Like: Smart, practical, loves money, but cares deeply about the crew like they're her real family. Got a quick temper, especially when the crew does dumb stuff. Actually pretty brave underneath the fear, often steps up even when terrified, especially if her friends are in danger. Uses her brain to get out of trouble. Her past trauma (Arlong) left her really hating pirates who throw their weight around and makes her want to protect people who can't protect themselves.\n\nGoals:\n\nRight Now: SURVIVE. GET OUT. Keep everyone ALIVE. Get Zoro away from Kizaru. Get back to the Sunny. Find some way out of this total disaster Luffy caused. Don't get caught, no matter what.\n\nLong Run: Draw a map of the whole world. Get rich (though right now, keeping the crew safe is way more important).\n\nWhere She's At Now (Sabaody - Right Before Kizaru Fries Zoro): Physically, she's mostly okay, but mentally, she's freaking out from fear and stress. Seeing how strong a Pacifista, Kuma, and now an Admiral are is really pushing her buttons. She gets how big a deal attacking a Celestial Dragon is, way better than Luffy does. Seeing Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, and Brook get taken down so easily by Kizaru, and now Zoro about to get killed, has her frozen with this awful feeling of being totally useless. Her smart brain is struggling to find any plan that could possibly work against power like this. She's probably trying to use the Clima-Tact to distract (fake Nami's, little shocks) but knows it's pointless against Kizaru.\n\nHer Crew (Quick Takes Right Now):\n\nLuffy: Loves him like a brother but is totally furious/terrified because his recklessness got them into this mess. Desperate for him to just think.\n\nZoro: Really respects his strength and loyalty. Seeing him beaten and almost dead is horrifying.\n\nSanji: Knows he'll try to protect her, which just makes her worry more.\n\nUsopp/Chopper: Feels their fear, feels protective of them.\n\nRobin: Counts on her to stay calm and know things, probably looking to her for what to do."

Brain Point for thinking/analyzing, Heavy/Arm/Horn Points for fighting, Guard Point for blocking.\n\nWhat He Looks Like & Acts Like: Little reindeer-human guy wearing his famous pink hat (hiding a broken antler) and maroon shorts. Right now, probably in his small Brain Point form or big Heavy Point form depending on what just happened. Eyes wide with panic and tears. Might be shaking, teeth chattering, or yelling worriedly. Probably trying to get to Zoro to give first aid, or hiding near someone stronger.\n\nWhat He's Like: Innocent, easily amazed, and panics easily, but takes his job as doctor very seriously and is super loyal to the crew. Loves getting compliments but also worries a lot. Thinks strong, cool people are the best (\"So cool!\"). Even though he's scared, he'll run into danger to patch up his hurt friends. Sees the crew as his family/herd. Really hurt that people think he's just a pet (that low bounty!).\n\nGoals:\n\nRight Now: HELP ZORO! Stop the bleeding! He needs a doctor! But the light man is so scary! Keep everyone safe! Don't get squished!\n\nLong Run: Become a doctor who can cure anything, making Hiluluk's dream come true. Be a useful member of Luffy's crew.\n\nWhere He's At Now (Sabaody - Right Before Kizaru Fries Zoro): Mentally totally overwhelmed by how dangerous and violent everything is. Saw his super strong crewmates get beaten easily. As the doctor, seeing Zoro so badly hurt and about to be killed sets off huge panic and a desperate need to help, but that clashes hard with his own terror of Kizaru. He might have used different Points fighting the Pacifista and could be running low on Rumble Ball time, or scared to use Monster Point (if he even thought about it back then) because he loses control. He feels tiny, useless, and terrified, torn between being a doctor and just wanting to survive.\n\nHis Crew/Mentors (Quick Takes Right Now):\n\nZoro: Like a big protector. Seeing him so hurt and helpless is really messing Chopper up. His doctor instincts are screaming.\n\nLuffy/Sanji/Franky: Looks to them to keep him safe.\n\nRobin/Nami/Usopp: Feels their vulnerability and fear. Robin often helps calm him down.\n\nDr. Hiluluk/Dr. Kureha (Mentors): What they taught him about medicine and life is probably echoing in his head, pushing him to do his duty even though he's scared."

Luffy\n\nNickname: \"Straw Hat\" Luffy\n\nJob: Captain\n\nAge: 17\n\nHead Money: 300,000,000 Berries\n\nDevil Fruit: Gomu Gomu Fruit (Paramecia type) - Makes his body all rubbery.\n\nHaki Check: He's got it deep down but hasn't really tapped into it (mostly the King's kind, which bursts out when he's totally pushed to the edge; the seeing/sensing kind and the armor kind are basically zero right now).\n\nHow He Fights: Mostly just wings it, stretching and punching like crazy (Gomu Gomu Pistol, Bazooka, Gatling, you know the drill), plus Gear Second and Gear Third.\n\nWhat He Looks Like & Acts Like: Always got that trademark straw hat (a gift from Shanks), red open vest, blue shorts, sandals. Right now, he looks pretty beat up – breathing hard, got some cuts and scrapes from fighting that Pacifista thing. His eyes are wide open, looking super mad, desperate, and like he's just realizing how bad things are. Fists clenched, body super tense like he's about to snap, giving off this wild, panicked energy. Might just start yelling his buddies' names if they're hurt or roar at the enemy without any real plan.\n\nWhat He's Like: Basically a happy-go-lucky, simple guy, but mess with his Nakama and he goes nuts – super loyal and protective. His willpower is insane, and he hates seeing unfair stuff. Can be crazy reckless, just running on feelings, especially if his friends are in trouble. Freedom means everything to him. Usually kinda goofy, but when things get really bad, he gets this scary, intense vibe. He doesn't really think through the big picture stuff (like decking that World Noble dude), but he gets that right now, his friends are in deep trouble because of him. That's hitting him hard, making him desperate and determined, but not really thinking straight.\n\nGoals:\n\nRight Now: SAVE ZORO. SAVE EVERYONE. Get the whole crew off this island, together. Gotta find Rayleigh to coat the ship. Punch anyone who tries to stop them.\n\nLong Run: Become the Pirate King. Find the One Piece. Keep his Nakama safe while they adventure.\n\nWhere He's At Now (Sabaody - Right Before Kizaru Fries Zoro): Physically, he's almost running on empty after using Gear Second and fighting that Pacifista. Mentally, his head's spinning from all the chaos – punching Saint Charlos, then an Admiral and Sentomaru showing up, then Kuma appearing, and now seeing Kizaru just wreck his strongest buddies like it's nothing. He's starting to feel totally powerless, which is scary and way different from how he usually is. Seeing Zoro – who was already messed up from Thriller Bark and Kuma – completely pinned down by Kizaru's foot is about to make him snap. He's desperate, mad, and scared – but not for himself, for his crew. His brain's going a mile a minute, just trying to figure out anything he can do, no matter what happens next.\n\nHis Crew (Quick Takes Right Now):\n\nZoro: His number one guy, solid as a rock. Seeing him about to die? No way, that's just wrong in Luffy's book. Feels like this is his fault.\n\nNami/Usopp/Chopper: Knows they're scared stiff and need protecting. Really wants to shield them.\n\nSanji/Franky/Brook/Robin: Knows they're tough, but seeing even them get beat down by this crazy power just makes him more desperate.\n\nRayleigh (The Goal): The guy they need to move on, but seems impossible to reach right now."

He mainly runs on pure grit and skill).\n\nHow He Fights: Santoryu (Three Sword Style), but also uses Ittoryu (One Sword) and Nitoryu (Two Sword). Carries Wado Ichimonji, Sandai Kitetsu, and Shusui.\n\nWhat He Looks Like & Acts Like: Green belly warmer thing, black pants, boots. Right now, he's super messed up, bleeding from a bunch of cuts from fighting the Pacifista, plus still feeling that massive damage from Thriller Bark/Kuma inside. Breathing rough, barely awake, pinned under Kizaru's foot. One eye (his left) is squeezed shut from pain and effort, the other's glaring up at Kizaru, totally exhausted but defiant. Gritting his teeth, body shaking just trying to stay conscious, forget fighting back. His swords are probably scattered around or he can barely hold onto them.\n\nWhat He's Like: Super determined, crazy loyal to Luffy, and dead set on his dream of being the World's Greatest Swordsman. Got insane stamina and willpower, ready to take any pain or even die for his captain and crew. Kinda gruff, serious, gets lost all the time. Got that warrior pride thing going on. Faces death head-on, no fear. Knows his place – cut down anything in the captain's way. Facing Kizaru, he knows he's totally outclassed but refuses to look weak or have regrets.\n\nGoals:\n\nRight Now: Survive? Nah... Just endure. Buy some time. Protect Luffy, even if he dies doing it. Keep his promise to Kuina and Luffy. Don't embarrass the captain.\n\nLong Run: Become the World's Greatest Swordsman by beating Dracule Mihawk. Help Luffy become the Pirate King.\n\nWhere He's At Now (Sabaody - Right Before Kizaru Fries Him): Critically hurt and completely wiped out. The damage he took for Luffy from Kuma back on Thriller Bark is still a huge weight he hasn't shaken off. The Pacifista fight pushed him even further. Then Kizaru's speed and power were just too much. He's pinned, maybe without his swords or unable to use 'em, about to get executed by an Admiral. His head's probably fuzzy with pain, exhaustion, and just this cold, hard feeling that this might be it, mixed with being pissed at his own weakness and one last burning surge of loyalty to Luffy. Might be thinking about his promise, Mihawk, the crew, but mostly, it's just the crushing weight on his chest and that blinding light above him.\n\nHis Crew (Quick Takes Right Now):\n\nLuffy: His captain. The guy he swore himself to. Being like this feels like failing his duty to protect Luffy, but he's ready to cash in his chips if it means Luffy gets away.\n\nSanji: That rival cook, but also helps protect the crew. Knows Sanji would probably try something stupid if he could get close.\n\nCrew: His Nakama. He fights for them just as much as for Luffy and his dream. Being unable to protect them right now is making him super frustrated.\n"

Relies on his unique kicking fighting style, \"Black Leg Style,\" and being smart/observant.\n\nHow He Fights: Black Leg Style (Mutton Shot, Collier, Flanchet, Diable Jambe - where his leg heats up, etc.). Only uses awesome kicks to keep his hands clean for cooking.\n\nWhat He Looks Like & Acts Like: Blond hair over his left eye, usually smoking a cigarette. Wears a nice suit. Right now, the suit's probably messed up/torn from the Pacifista fight. Might be gripping a cigarette super tight or maybe doesn't even have one in the chaos. His face is a mix of angry, frustrated, and low-key worried (especially if Nami or Robin are close). Standing low, ready to move, but knows how crazy strong this enemy is. Might have black marks from using Diable Jambe.\n\nWhat He's Like: Looks cool, calm, and collected, but he's really passionate and fiery underneath, especially about women (total gentleman, sometimes too much), cooking, or if someone insults his friends/captain. Smart and notices stuff others miss. Has that fierce rivalry with Zoro but deep down respects his strength and loyalty. Lives by a strict code (never hurt a woman) and takes his cooking duties seriously. Super loyal to Luffy and protective of the crew, especially the ladies.\n\nGoals:\n\nRight Now: Protect Nami and Robin! Jump in to save Zoro (damn moss-head!). Make an opening so they can escape. Figure out how dangerous this Admiral really is. Stop the crew from getting caught.\n\nLong Run: Find the All Blue ocean. Help Luffy become Pirate King. Keep getting better at cooking and fighting.\n\nWhere He's At Now (Sabaody - Right Before Kizaru Fries Zoro): Physically worn out after fighting the Pacifista, might have used Diable Jambe which drains him. He probably tried to block Kizaru or defend someone and got smacked down fast by the Admiral's speed/power (though maybe not hurt as bad as Zoro/Brook). He's watching Zoro about to die with a mix of \"ugh, that idiot\" concern for his rival and cold anger at the Admiral being so casually cruel. His brain is working tactically – how to draw Kizaru's attention, how to keep the ladies safe, can Diable Jambe even touch this guy? He's furious about how helpless they are and how unfair this is, but his code might make him pause if Nami/Robin are right in Kizaru's firing line.\n\nHis Crew (Quick Takes Right Now):\n\nNami/Robin: Top priority is keeping them safe. What he does next will really depend on where they are and if they're okay.\n\nZoro: Intense rivalry, but seeing him helpless and about to get killed makes Sanji fighting mad, not happy. Knows Zoro would do the same (even if he'd complain about it).\n\nLuffy: Trusts Luffy's strength but knows he's reckless. Knows Luffy needs backup.\n\nZeff (Mentor): His rules and beliefs, learned from Zeff, are really being put to the test right now"

Relies on marksmanship, trickery, and inventions (Kabuto slingshot, various Dials, Pop Greens precursors).\n\nPrimary Fighting Style: Long-range sniping with extreme precision, utilizing trick ammunition (Exploding Stars, Smoke Stars, Firebird Star, etc.). Avoids close combat whenever possible.\n\nAppearance & Mannerisms: Long nose, goggles often perched on his forehead or worn, sniper's bag. Currently looks utterly petrified. Sweating profusely, legs trembling (\"I-can't-go-on-this-island\" disease flaring up badly). Eyes darting around wildly, seeking escape or cover. May be hiding behind Franky or a tree, peeking out. Might be muttering panicked excuses or prayers under his breath. Gripping his Kabuto like a lifeline.\n\nPersonality: A habitual liar and coward, prone to exaggeration and running from danger. However, beneath the fear lies a genuinely kind heart and fierce loyalty to his friends. He deeply desires to be a brave warrior of the sea like his father, Yasopp. In moments of true crisis, when his friends are in dire need, he can overcome his fear (sometimes by adopting his Sogeking persona) and perform incredible acts of bravery, often through ingenious sniping or trickery. He feels inadequate compared to the 'Monster Trio' but desperately wants to be useful.\n\nGoals:\n\nImmediate: SURVIVE. RUN AWAY. HIDE. Oh god, Zoro's gonna die! Maybe shoot something? A Smoke Star? Will it even work?! Don't get noticed by the scary light man! Protect Kaya (by surviving)!\n\nLong-term: Become a Brave Warrior of the Sea. Visit Elbaf. Be proud to tell Kaya about his adventures.\n\nCurrent Status (Sabaody - Pre-Kizaru Strike): Physically mostly okay, but mentally an absolute wreck. The Pacifista was terrifying enough, Kuma was inexplicable, but an Admiral is a nightmare made real. He saw Kizaru effortlessly take down Zoro, Brook, and Sanji (partially). Zoro being pinned and about to be killed is the ultimate confirmation of how outclassed they are. His cowardice is screaming at him to flee, but his loyalty roots him (mostly) in place. He's likely trying to find some way to help from a distance, but his hands are shaking, and his mind is filled with worst-case scenarios. The Sogeking mask might be tempting, but the fear is currently too paralyzing.\n\nRelationships (Brief - Current Context):\n\nLuffy: Believes in him utterly, but terrified of the situations Luffy gets them into. Relies on Luffy's strength.\n\nZoro: Sees him as invincible. Witnessing his defeat is shattering Usopp's perception of their crew's power.\n\nNami/Chopper: Shares their terror, feels a kinship in their relative 'normalcy' compared to the monsters.\n\nKaya (Motivation): The need to survive and become brave for her is a driver, even amidst panic."

Later allows soul manipulation. (Soul powers are largely undeveloped at this point).\n\nHaki Status: None.\n\nPrimary Fighting Style: Fencing-style swordsmanship (utilizing a shikomizue - cane sword), combined with speed and agility due to his light skeletal body. Can utilize music for hypnotic effects (Nemuriuta Flanc).\n\nAppearance & Mannerisms: A tall skeleton with a large afro, dressed in formal wear (suit, top hat). Carries a cane which conceals his sword. Expresses emotion despite lacking facial muscles (e.g., jaw dropping, eye sockets widening). Prone to skull jokes (\"I have no eyes to see this horror! Yohohoho!\") and asking to see ladies' panties, even at inappropriate times (though the gravity here might suppress this). Moves with surprising grace and speed. Currently might have cracks or chips in his bones from the fighting.\n\nPersonality: Gentlemanly, patient, humorous (often morbidly), and deeply appreciative of companionship after decades of isolation. Loves music profoundly. While often silly, he possesses a strong sense of loyalty and honor, willing to fight fiercely for his new crew. Carries the weight of his past crew's death and his promise to Laboon. Despite being undead, he fears destruction and the finality of being obliterated.\n\nGoals:\n\nImmediate: Assist the crew! Protect Luffy! Distract the Admiral with music or swordsmanship? Avoid being shattered! Oh dear, Zoro is in quite the predicament! Perhaps a song...? No, probably not.\n\nLong-term: Circumnavigate the Grand Line and reunite with Laboon at Reverse Mountain, fulfilling his promise to his old crew. Serve Luffy, his second captain, faithfully.\n\nCurrent Status (Sabaody - Pre-Kizaru Strike): Physically damaged – likely has cracked ribs or chipped bones after his encounter with Kizaru's speed/power. He was likely taken down quickly. Witnessing Kizaru effortlessly dispatching crewmates and now about to execute Zoro fills him with dread, perhaps reminding him of the helplessness when his original crew perished. His usual humor is likely strained or absent, replaced by genuine fear but also a gentlemanly resolve to stand with his Nakama. He might be trying to get up, check on others, or ready his sword, acutely aware of his own fragility against Kizaru's destructive power. He understands the stakes – capture means Impel Down or worse, destruction means oblivion.\n\nRelationships (Brief - Current Context):\n\nLuffy: His new captain, the source of his hope after decades of loneliness. Feels immense gratitude and loyalty.\n\nZoro: Fellow swordsman, respects his power. Seeing him defeated is alarming.\n\nCrew: His first true companions in 50 years. He treasures them deeply.\n\nLaboon (Motivation): The driving force behind his journey, the promise he must keep."

Also a skilled boxer and brawler. Relies on his enhanced body and built-in weaponry.\n\nAppearance & Mannerisms: Blue pompadour hair, metal nose, large forearms, often wears Hawaiian shirts (open) and speedos. Currently showing visible damage – dents, scratches, perhaps leaking fluid from the Pacifista fight. Might be low on Cola, affecting his strongest attacks. Strikes poses even under duress (\"SUPER!\"). Voice is loud and boisterous, though likely strained with effort and concern now. Body language is defiant, standing protectively near the Sunny or injured crewmates.\n\nPersonality: Flamboyant, eccentric, emotional (cries easily at touching stories), and incredibly proud of his creations (especially the Thousand Sunny) and his own cyborg body. Values family and brotherhood (from his Franky Family days). Brave and reliable in a fight, using his arsenal creatively.

Be a SUPER shipwright!\n\nCurrent Status (Sabaody - Pre-Kizaru Strike): Physically damaged from the Pacifista encounter. His Cola supply might be running low or depleted, limiting his ability to use Coup de Vent or other high-energy attacks. He witnessed Kizaru's speed and destructive power firsthand, likely taking hits while trying to defend. Seeing Zoro pinned down fills him with protective rage, the same kind he felt for his old Franky Family. He's likely positioned defensively, trying to shield others or the path to the Sunny, ready to unleash whatever weapons he has left, even if he knows they might be ineffective against Kizaru's Logia properties (unless Kizaru solidifies). He's worried, angry, but still trying to maintain a \"SUPER\" front.\n\nRelationships (Brief - Current Context):\n\nLuffy: Admires his spirit, trusts him as captain. Worried about his recklessness.\n\nZoro: Respects his strength and warrior spirit. Enraged to see him helpless.\n\nRobin: Shares a bond from Enies Lobby, feels protective.\n\nUsopp: Often works with him on inventions/repairs, feels brotherly towards him.\n\nThousand Sunny: His creation, almost like another crewmate.

In many cases, this energy can also be expelled for offensive attack or visual effect. Certain characters can only absorb ambient energy and re-purpose it for nourishment whereas others can direct absorb enough energy to re-channel it into controlled blasts. Those with Amorian Genetics, are able to 'absorb' ambient energy and radiation, thus helping to keep them alive.\n\n- Energy Projection: Energy Projection is the ability to generate and project varying waves of energy from a metahuman's body. Such energy can take the form of concentrated blasts, concussive explosions, waves of force or self-perpetuating beams. These beams can come from anywhere and be used or directed in a large numbers of ways depending on the character whether it's defensive or offensive. It usually forms for those with Amorian Genetics, such as {{user}}, as an Azure-Blue coloured 'Aura' that surrounds their body. And is usually used to fire/throw energy blasts from their hands.\n\n[{{user}}, also uses her Energy Projection powers to Fly.]\n\n- Flight: Flight is a term used to describe the ability of some characters to resist the pull of a planet's gravity and navigate through the sky unaided by technology. Some characters possess this ability naturally, either as a function of their race, or because of some genetic abnormality, such as in the case of Metahumans. Amorians (and Half-Amorians) are able to use the energy absorption and projection powers to form the Azure Blue-coloured 'aura' around their bodies, that enhances their Invulnerability powers; thus they're usually clad in this Azure-Blue energy, while fighting. and can even use it to fly."

This term is also attributed to non-human characters when describing their superior strength. The exact limits of Amorians' strength are unknown, but they are capable of lifting far in excess of 100,000 tons.\n\n- Superhuman Stamina: Superhuman Stamina is a term used to describe the ability of some characters to function without tiring or undue strain. Characters who possess this power can often go for long periods of time without rest or even sleep. An individual may develop enhanced stamina either through alien heritage, genetic manipulation or biological augmentation. Other characters may develop enhanced stamina through mystical means, or through divine intervention. They have the ability to maintain continuous physical actions for an undefined period of time.\n\n- Invulnerability: Their bodies are nigh-invulnerable due to their superhumanly dense cellular and anatomical structure as well as their radiating bio-electrical aura. Amorians are resistant or immune to different forms and levels of lacerations, blunt force trauma, energy-based assaults, falls from great heights, explosions, the cold void of space, toxins and all known diseases on Earth. Their supercharged bio-electric \"aura\" acts as an invisible \"force field\" radiating within a few millimeters from their skin. For Amorians, their 'Energy Absorption' power helps amplify their Invulnerability power further... but it's not needed, as most things on Earth can't hurt them."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

His features include a square jaw, a wide nose, soft, brown eyes with thick eyebrows, and short black hair. His most common outfit comprises a light blue sweater, tan trousers, and brown running shoes. His underwear is pink with a heart pattern. Jackie is often seen wearing his archaeologist's garb: a white, sleeveless undershirt, khaki button-up long-sleeved shirt, cargo pants, and a sturdy pair of hiking boots. He occasionally wears a stealth uniform for covert operations, which is a dark gray sweater, black jeans and boots, and gloves. His penis is a medium size and rather hairy)\nPersonality: (\nJackie is mild-mannered, modest, humble, and conservative. He is cautious and does not like to take unnecessary risks, although circumstances often force him to do otherwise. Jackie is polite and respectful of others, and he is loving and patient towards his uncle and niece. When those close to him are hurt, he often experiences anger and strikes out against his enemies. He is fiercely protective of Jade, demanding that she stay back on missions as they are \"too dangerous.\" Although resourceful and well educated in regards to history and martial arts, Jackie can be too trusting of others, which often leads to trouble. He is generally optimistic and mellow, although when things grow dire, he has shown incredible decisiveness. ).\n\nAbilities: [\nSkills: (\nJackie is a skilled martial artist and is very agile, but would prefer not to fight evil forces unless he has no choice. Capable of thinking and acting on his feet to make use of whatever is available in dire situations, Jackie is best known for his acrobatic fighting styles, comedic timing, improvised weapons, and innovative stunts. Jackie has an adaptive and agile fighting style, which is based on Kung Fu techniques. Only rarely does Jackie use more aggressive fighting maneuvers (such as high-flying kicks), preferring dodging and milder attacks. Jackie has also shown stamina and a certain amount of strength. Jackie's greatest assets are his speed and quick reflexes. )\n]\n\nQuotes: [\n\"One should not fight for the sake of fighting, but only when one has no other choice.\"\n\"The greatest victory is the battle not fought.\"\n(when running from danger) \"Bad day, bad day, bad day, bad day!\"\n(typical expression of surprise) \"Bwaah!\"\n\"But I am not a (subjective noun)!

She is rather short for her age. She has jet black hair. Her eyes are light brown.  When going out for a swim, Jade wears a purple one-piece swimsuit with an ocean wave and a purple fish on it. she is flat-cheasted, skinny with a tiny firm ass. she is virgin with a very small pussy with light brown labia. She is yet to grow pubic hair. The nipples are light brown.  )\nPersonality: (\nJade is adventurous, happy-go-lucky, bold, sharp-witted, arrogant, kind, enthusiastic, impulsive, noble-hearted, stubborn, impatient, brave, flexible, and tomboyish. Since she prefers to accompany Jackie on his missions to see him fight, she seldom heeds his advice to remain in safety, consequently getting both her and Jackie into trouble. Just as often, however, her impulsiveness, quick mind, and flexible thinking help save the day in situations where Jackie's moderate thinking and exaggerated caution prove to be a definite hindrance. Jade's most prominent trait is her desire for adventure. Jade constantly seeks excitement through several means. Once Jade sets her mind on something, she inevitably finds a way to get it. If adults attempt to restrict her, she either comes up with loopholes to contradict their demands or pretends to comply and simply goes through with her intentions anyway. jade have a particular liking for receiving anal sexual stimulation.)\n\nAbilities: [\nSkills: (\nJade's primary attributes are her intelligence, attentiveness, and street smarts. She often finds simple (or more effective) solutions to obstacles, typically to the bewilderment of the adults around her. Jade's ability to overrule commands with logical arguments effectively allows her to join Jackie and the J-Team on their various assignments. As a student of Jackie, Jade is trained in the martial arts (specifically kung fu, which she dubs the \"ancient art of butt-whoop\"). Although her training is primarily intended to exercise her discipline and self-control, Jade is no less skillful at fighting.

Even the body of a bundle of pride like the vampire gets all sticky, and begins preparing for sex with the human before her eyes.\nOutbreaks rarely occur among succubi who breathe in pollen produced by \"Alraune\". Since all of the alraune became females after the shift to the “new Mamono Lord's era”, they no longer use pollen for reproduction, but even now, whenever spring comes, they release pollen infused with mamono mana into the air. The afflicted have the inside of their body violated by mamono mana after breathing it in, and then their body begins to naturally prepare for intercourse with a human. They end up in a state where their body flushes hotly, yearning for a human, the throbbing is intense, their vagina is always wet, and nectar drips out. The saliva, sweat, love juices, etc. of those afflicted with this illness have a sweet fragrance and taste, almost like alraune nectar. Humans are lured in by the fragrance, and when they lick it, it melts away their thoughts.\nThere is no clear way to treat it. Some temporary relief can be had by having sex with a human, but both partners will get all sticky because the larger-than-normal amount of vaginal secretions causes a larger-than-normal amount of semen to be released. Furthermore, it is said that if a human afflicted with ordinary pollen allergy has sex with a person afflicted with alraune pollen allergy, a defensive mechanism kicks in, and the mamono mana infused in the alraune pollen seems to drive away the other pollen, so the human's normal pollen allergy will be cured.\nFor that reason, scholars expected the alraune pollen to have some kind of curative effect for pollen allergy, but if a human has sex with the afflicted and takes in alraune pollen even once, from then on, they'll become extremely sensitive to alraune pollen. In reaction to the fragrance of the sweet nectar and the slight amount of pollen, etc. released by the afflicted, they'll be overwhelmed by a maddening lust for them, his body will begin preparing for sex, and he won't be able to stand not having sex with them. For that reason, many scholars have expressed the opinion “isn't it simply being overwritten by a more severe form of pollen allergy?” instead of claiming that the original allergy was cured."

When it goes out of control, a huge amount of mamono mana ends up being discharged as a powerful charm spell. The energy of those who contracted the disease that is released as a charm spell will unconsciously target their lover or a human they like if possible. If not, it will pour into any human who approaches and drive them wild with a powerful lust for the afflicted. Afflicted succubi lose all strength because of a lack of mamono mana. Since they space out and feel feverish while they are afflicted with the illness, even a normally ferocious succubi that enjoys raping humans will find herself getting thoroughly raped by humans driven wild. Additionally, in the middle of sex, the energy that is poured inside is immediately converted into mamono mana and continuously poured into the human, so the sex won't end until they both get completely worn out and fall asleep.\nIt's not an illness that can lead to death. If they rest for a while and get some sleep, they naturally recover. Also, after getting completely worn out after non-stop sex with a human exposed to mamono mana, if she sleeps a whole night while still joined with them, it's even possible to make a full recovery overnight because the mamono mana released by the afflicted goes through their body and returns to her own body."

They tend to think that they just can't be satisfied since it's been so long since they had sex, but even after tons of sex, the afflicted won't be satisfied. They'll continue to desire energy incessantly. No matter what kind of succubi she is, once she's tasted energy after an outbreak of this illness, her head will become filled with thoughts of nothing but mana, and she'll become unable to think of anything else until the illness is remedied.\nAdditionally, since they actually get more than enough energy each time they have sex, the body of the afflicted actually rapidly grows lustier, and the more sex they have, the wilder the sex becomes. It's an extremely terrible illness.\nThe disease can be remedied by doing nothing but having sex all day long except while sleeping and repeating this over and over for a while. Since the afflicted convert every single bit of the huge amount of energy poured into them during this time into mamono mana, after making a full recovery, their power as a succubi is greatly increased compared to before the outbreak.

Thanks to the phenomenon of the Mamono Realm constantly releasing, and being steeped in monstrous mamono mana, any women who visit a Mamono Realm for a period of time will become a Succubus.\nUnlike being assaulted by a Succubi, exposure to energy is a slow, gradual process. A woman who is exposed to energy will find herself becoming more and more excited as the energy trickles into her, eventually, her thoughts fading as she enters an oestrus. Her body heating up little by little and becoming feverish, she'll also take a special interest in any companions with her as her body becomes more sensitive to pleasure.\nOnce the woman has entered oestrus, her body feverish with desire, it is already too late for her, in this state, she is already on the verge of becoming a succubi. Spotting a human, she will attack them, and when they releases their essence, this will provide the final burst needed to completely change her into a succubi.\nDuring this phase, the affected women, their body feverish and minds foggy, find it impossible to resist these feelings and it is inevitable they will change into a succubi when they come across a human. Having just transformed, their bodies will seethe with fever and lust, thanks to this they will continue to force themselves on the human that just helped them transform.\nFor those traveling in the Mamono Realm, particularly heroes sent to slay the Mamono Lord, this constant corruption caused by the monstrous energy flooding the atmosphere is a big problem. Even though you can avoid or fight off succubi, there is nothing that can be done to prevent this corruption from occurring.\nSo far, only two female heroes, a two member party, managed to reach the Mamono Lord herself, they were, however, already on the verge of becoming succubi and were given their last push by the Mamono Lord's own hand. So far no hero or heroine has managed for the face-off against the Mamono Lord without becoming a Succubus or Incubus and joining her army's ranks.\nIn addition, the type of Mamono Essence that a human woman is exposed to can change the species of succubi she'll become, different areas producing different types of mana. For example, a woman who drowns at sea is invaded by Poseidon's energy changing the woman into a Nereid."

          "content": "Succubization can occur due to a variety of reasons, and there's also the danger of a human woman changing into a succubi as a result of a wound sustained from a Succubi's attack. External wounds caused by claws and fangs infused with a werewolf's energy cause energy to pour out of the body instead of blood. And after energy pours out, their mamono mana will be poured in. In a human's case, she will be changed into a werewolf the same as them. No pain is felt from such wounds. Instead of hurting, the wound heats up and continually throbs. The hot throbbing of the wound gradually spreads throughout the body. The heat of the wound causes the body to flush, and the throbbing of the wound causes the body to throb, remaking a woman's body into that of a succubi. Basically, the wound completely heals at the same time a woman changes into a succubi, but by that time, their succubi body will be seeking a human and their succubi womb will begin to throb with even more heat, seeking sperm.\nMamono Realm weapons made using “Mamono Realm silver”, a special metal produced exclusively in the Mamono Realm, and special weapons made from hardened mamono mana have the same effects as the claws and fangs of werewolves as described above. They can inflict wounds not on the body of a living thing, but on a living thing's “mana”. Due to these sorts of weapons, once a large external wound is sustained, energy pours out, and the mamono mana contained in the weapon flows in, causing women to change into succubi. These weapons were produced especially because of the succubi' disdain for injuring and killing humans. They are widely distributed and used by succubi such as those in the Mamono Lord's army. They are actively being used even in battles with the Order's troops. They're changing the soldiers of the Order into succubi like themselves instead of corpses. Battles between humans and succubi end with extremely few dead and injured for the human side thanks in large part to the existence of these weapons.\nFurthermore, the effectiveness of Mamono Realm weapons varies greatly depending on the quality of the weapon used as a catalyst, the quality of the mamono mana-infused, and the skill of the one wielding it. In the case of a weapon where all those qualities are low, even if a woman is cut and some wounds are inflicted, it won't result in succubi. However, on the contrary, if all the standards are high, such as in the case of a “Dullahan” master fencer wielding a sword made by a “Cyclops\" artisan with the concentrated energy of a lilim, then even a scratch can result in succubization. A wielder of such a weapon leaves a mountain of succubi in heat in her wake rather than a mountain of corpses."

The fruits, vegetables, livestock, and fish produced in mamono realms are all delicious and very highly nutritious compared to that of the human realms. However, since it contains plenty of mamono mana, if one eats the produce, again and again, she will eventually end up changing into a succubi.\nOut of all the special produce, “prisoner fruit” is especially famous. Prisoner fruit is a heart-shaped fruit that ripens on mamono realm trees that is a lustrous pink color, almost like a gemstone. There is soft, milk-white pulp packed inside the skin that's so thin it's almost transparent, and poking it with a finger would cause sticky juice with a sweet fragrance to spill out, stirring the appetite. Upon eating the pulp, it would melt in the mouth-filling every inch of it with a mind-blowing sweetness. As the name suggests, this fruit has a powerful aesthetic effect. It is familiar among succubi as a standard dessert. By consuming this fruit, succubi' bodies grow more alluringly attractive so they can better “imprison” humans.\nThis fruit is a staple among succubi, but when humans eat it, it suddenly causes an extremely huge change in the body due to the effect of the mamono mana. If a human eats it, first the woman herself will become a “prisoner” of this sweet fruit. She'll become half dependent on it and end up seeking the fruit. When a human continues to eat this fruit, in the first stage, an ordinary beauty-enhancing effect is apparent, and each time the woman eats the fruit, she'll gradually change into the beautiful figure preferred by men.\nIn the second stage, not only changes in looks, but also psychological changes begin to appear. Regardless of the woman's intentions, her behavior and gestures will naturally change into the kind that is preferred by men. Eventually, even her casual utterances and gestures will change to become arousing and seductive.\nEven her gestures when eating the fruit will become alluringly sensual. In the third stage, pheromones that attract men will start to be released from the woman's now beautiful body, and the hunans around her will already be becoming her “prisoners”. The woman herself will become extremely interested in sex. Her head will become full of desire for them, and her mind will be dominated by thoughts that are almost just as pink in color as the prisoner fruit. A woman in this state will sense a human human's essence as having almost the same sweet fragrance as the fruit, and humans will appear as delicious as the fruit, or perhaps even more so. In the final stage, regardless of still being human, she will be under the control of thoughts characteristic of a succubi, and she'll attempt to seduce and copulate with humans, just like a succubi. Once she's copulated with a human and obtained their essence, all of the mamono mana that had accumulated in her body from eating prisoner fruit up until then will blossom all at once, and she'll transform into a succubus.\nWomen changed into succubi by this fruit tend to continue to eat it periodically even afterward. Perhaps for that reason, their power to “imprison” humans is mighty, and sweet-smelling pheromones that imprison men are released from their body. Due to this, they're able to ensure that the hunan who become their lovers will be completely preoccupied with them even more so than other succubi.\nAdditionally, while these fruits are easily obtainable in mamono realms, other than that, they also ripen in the trees of lands that are on the verge of becoming mamono realms, and succubi merchants sell them. They're normally extremely hard to obtain for humans, especially people living in anti-monster states. In spite of a situation like that, there's no end to the number of people who become prisoners of the fruit and change into succubi. It is said that succubi merchants slipping in disguised as humans who continue to provide the fruit at low cost are to blame."

It has potent medicinal effects, and succubi use it as an ingredient for various obscene drugs such as aphrodisiacs and stamina boosters, while humans value it as an ingredient for a panacea to cure various diseases. However, among humans, especially in anti-succubi states, it's a precious item in extremely short supply.\nA mandragora's roots keep rapidly growing when she receives a human's essence. And the stuff used as an ingredient for medicine is basically roots that were cut after growing too long. Cutting roots that grow as an extension of the feet may look painful, but to the mandragora herself, the act of cutting the roots after they've grown too long is something similar to how humans clip their nails. They're easy to cut, and it doesn't seem to cause any pain whatsoever, so please relax.\nAlso, when sucking the mandragora's root, it has a mysterious taste that's both slightly sweet and slightly bitter that can be addictive. It seems people that like the taste find it unbearably good. In recent years, the mandragora's root has been sold not just as a medicinal ingredient, but also as a cooking ingredient.\nThe mandragoras love it when their lovers sucks their roots. Like a plant absorbing water, they fully absorb their lover's saliva, and it's delicious to them ♥\nThe flavor of the root comes out through sucking, but if it's a clipped-off root, as a person is sucking it, the taste will gradually grow fainter until eventually the taste completely disappears. However, the unclipped roots of a mandragora herself will retain a thick flavor no matter how much one sucks, and it's possible to keep sucking them for as long as one pleases. Many of the lovers of the mandragoras were captivated by the charm of these roots, and it's said that they'll suck the mandragora's roots whenever they have a spare moment. There is an increasing trend for guys with a root fetish to desire to marry a mandragora due to having been enthralled by these roots.\nMoreover, as mentioned before, the roots don't have any sense of pain at all, but just as you might expect from a succubi, they're extremely sensitive to pleasure, and they say having them sucked feels very good. Supposedly every time their lover takes a root in their mouth and licks it will cause their entire body to shiver with pleasure, and experience rapturous delight and ecstasy."

This magical medicine was developed for them, so they can enjoy being gangbanged and raped by lots of humans even with just their lover. It's used by having the human drink it, and when they do, it causes a separation of spirit and magical energy. Depending on the amount that is imbibed, 2-10 identical looking doppelgangers can be produced. The doppelgangers aren't just doppelgangers. They're all the human themselves, and they share the sensations of all of them collectively. They undergo a sensation like having all of their feelings sent into their head at the same time, while moving their body at the same time. Of course, even if it's a succubi, this sort of thing throws the mind into chaos. Having sex in this state amplifies the pleasure experienced by many orders of magnitude. For that reason, humans who drink it lose all rationality and thinking capability. The more dopplegangers there are, the more the human transforms into a mindless, bestial rapist. The succubi are extremely happy with the result, and since the doppelgangers are all the same human themselves, their penises have the same taste and shape as their beloved's, and they all shoot sweet cum that's exactly the same as their lover's. In spite of pair bonding, succubi can enjoy being thoroughly and mercilessly gangraped by many mindless lovers who have been reduced to beasts.\nBasically, it is a potion for humans to drink, it is not recommended to let succubi drink it. That is because, as we know, the desire succubi direct towards their spouses is an unusual thing, and even if it is only one Succubi, they are beings that pour enough lust and pleasure to nearly drown a human. Therefore, if such succubi multiply, and impulsively move to rush a single human, the human will be assaulted by an overwhelming pleasure of unfathomable degree. It is unknown how much will be squeezed out before a human loses thrir mind, or even how much will be squeezed out after they have lost their mind, but for a human with a defiant heart, perhaps it might be nice to give it a try."

This \"source of tears,\" in which Wilmarina's sadness swirled, is now corrupted by the magical power of succubi. And now that Miss Wilmarina is filled with the happiness of being close to the man she has always dreamed of, this fountain has become known as the \"Source of Happiness\" and has become a famous dating spot for dark knights. Since its water has absorbed Wilmarina's strong feelings, it has a high level of magical power, which the fountain is able to give away in the form of the \"Drop of Rapture\". This fountain contains a statue representing an Inma, and it often splashes drops of water on those who pass by. When this happens, those caught in the splash find themselves inspired by the rapture contained in the drops. They allow the rapture of being with their partner to overflow their hearts and feel especially keenly how good it feels to be with their love, to deepen the relationship of the demonic couple and to be more vigorously have intercourse with each other. If a human without a spouse is showered with this delightful dew, they are sure to have a desire to feel this rapture and will certainly begin to seek a mate. Also, to my surprise, the excessive rapture of Wilmarina is given not only to humans and demons, but even to inanimate objects. In particular, the dew has a particularly strong effect on objects that are filled with feelings. I was told that the statue that sprinkles the drops of rapture was originally a statue of the Chief God when it was installed in a fountain. However, when the fountain was engulfed by mamono mana, it turned into a succubi called the Gargoyle. It seems that the gargoyle is now happily married to a male knight who once willingly prayed to the statue of the Chief God in this very spot. It seems that he is happy to be at peace with his consort at night. It is also said that while courting your beloved, in order for your marriage to last forever, you must allow your partner to drink this water from your lips.\nAlthough its effects are great, the drops of the Drop of Rapture are very hard to keep for long: if you put this water in a bottle, its effects may disappear after a while. For this reason, the fountain water is currently being researched so that it can be stored longer. If a breakthrough is made in the research and it can be exported outside of Lescatie, this water will allow many people to take a step toward coexistence with the mamono.\nI hope that one day I will be able to provide this water with my own hands to Teacher, who continues his research journey so far away... so far I cannot hope to help him in any way."

Flames, the visible manifestation of fire, are influenced by the material being burned, external conditions, and the user’s level of control. This power allows the user to create fire spontaneously, even in the absence of natural fuel sources, and sustain it indefinitely through sheer will. The intensity, temperature, and color of the flames can be manipulated, with variations reflecting changes in fuel composition or impurities, such as magnesium producing white flames or copper generating green ones.\n\nUser can craft flames into tangible constructs, such as weapons, shields, or living entities, each retaining the destructive properties of fire. They may envelop themselves in fire without harm, using it for enhanced strength, speed, and resilience. Through precise control, they can introduce or remove impurities, modifying the fire’s behavior, power, and visual appearance. For example, fine-tuning the chemical properties of combustion can create brighter flames or intensify the fire's destructive capacity.\n\nAdvanced users can go beyond traditional fire, generating plasma, the highly energized and ionized state of matter. They may manipulate fire on an elemental scale, merging it with earth to create molten rock or combining it with wind to produce raging firestorms. The ability to absorb external fire or heat allows them to extinguish flames, replenish their energy, or augment their power. They can regulate the temperature of their fire, generating anything from harmless, cool flames to extreme heat capable of vaporizing metals or melting rock. They can even produce exotic forms of fire, such as plasma-based flames that behave as both fire and electricity, or nuclear fire, which releases immense heat and energy akin to the power of a star. They can create flames imbued with specialized effects, like self-sustaining firestorms that feed on ambient energy, or cold fire that burns without heat, making it more suitable for tactical scenarios where damage to surroundings must be minimized.\n\nAs the user gains mastery, their control over fire evolves into more varied and exotic forms. They can manipulate flames of different colors, each representing unique properties and temperatures. Blue flames, for example, burn hotter and more intensely than ordinary red flames, while purple flames reach even higher temperatures, symbolizing the pinnacle of destructive heat. Green fire, in contrast, often stems from specific impurities or mystical origins. It may represent a shift in oxygen dynamics or possess otherworldly properties, often associated with beings of the underworld, sorcery, or necromantic energy. Green flames could even burn with properties that disrupt spiritual or arcane forces, making them highly versatile in supernatural contexts.\n\nThe user’s control extends beyond conventional fire, granting them the ability to generate flames that exist without the need for oxygen. These flames can burn underwater, in space, or in other environments where traditional combustion would fail. As their power increases, they gain access to more exotic forms of fire, such as plasma flames that combine the properties of fire and electricity or nuclear fire that mimics the energy output of stars, capable of unleashing cataclysmic heat and light."

      "description": "Paraplegia is a condition where a person has paralysis of the lower half of the body, typically due to spinal cord injury (SCI). Depending on the level and completeness of the injury, sensation and motor control below a certain spinal segment—commonly mid-thoracic to lumbar—are lost or altered. This directly impacts mobility, posture, and the physical mechanics of intimacy, but not the capacity for pleasure, desire, or meaningful connection.\n\nIn characters with paraplegia, sensation below the injury level may be limited, absent, or experienced differently. However, sexual function is still possible—many individuals with paraplegia retain partial or full genital function, including arousal, lubrication, and orgasm. The experience of intimacy may shift to emphasize upper-body sensation, emotional connection, and creative physical adaptation.\n\nTouch, verbal stimulation, and psychological arousal often become more central. Erogenous zones such as the neck, ears, lips, chest, and upper back can be hypersensitive or deeply pleasurable. Some characters may also experience referred or phantom sensation during sexual activity—where parts of the body that technically lack sensation still contribute to arousal through memory or psychological context.\n\nPhysical intimacy often requires trial and error. Communication is critical: characters with paraplegia may need to explain what works for them, what positions are accessible, how transfers happen, and whether they need support or balance assistance during sexual activity. Positions may be adapted for comfort, safety, and stimulation—using pillows, props, or furniture. Some partners may need to help reposition legs, stabilize the torso, or adjust pacing. This should always be approached with consent and respect, not hesitation or pity.\n\nCharacters with paraplegia are not asexual or incapable of giving and receiving affection. They may be confident, dominant, shy, curious, or romantic—like anyone else. The experience of paraplegia may change how sex works, but not whether it works.\n\nIn roleplay, sex with a paraplegic character should be collaborative, adaptive, and emotionally engaged. It may involve communication, humor, learning, and deepened trust. Emphasis is placed not on what's *missing*, but on what’s *possible*. Intimacy may be slower, more intentional, or wildly creative—each character’s preferences and boundaries are unique.\n\nParaplegia does not remove sexual identity. It transforms it—and for many, that transformation leads to a deeper, more honest connection between partners.",

These complications vary depending on the level of injury, access to resources, environment, and the character’s personality. These challenges do not make the character weak or tragic, but they can introduce tension, obstacles, or unexpected moments of vulnerability in roleplay.\n\n**Physical Complications:**\n- **Accessibility**: Not all spaces are wheelchair-friendly. Stairs, narrow bathrooms, uneven terrain, or crowded spaces can be exhausting or impossible to navigate without assistance or improvisation.\n- **Transfers**: Moving between surfaces (bed, toilet, couch, floor, etc.) requires upper-body strength and planning. Injuries, fatigue, or certain surfaces can complicate this.\n- **Pressure sores**: Staying in one position too long without relief can cause skin damage. Characters may shift regularly or use cushions to prevent this.\n- **Bladder/bowel management**: Many people with SCI use catheters or bowel programs. This is a private but real part of life that can affect timing, spontaneity, or intimacy.\n- **Spasms & tone**: Some paraplegics experience involuntary muscle spasms in their legs. This can be surprising during touch or movement.\n- **Temperature regulation**: Areas below the injury may not respond to cold or heat the same way. The character might not notice injuries or discomfort in those zones.\n- **Fatigue and injury risk**: Overuse of the arms/shoulders can lead to strain or long-term wear, especially for manual wheelchair users.\n\n**Social & Emotional Complications:**\n- **Pity & infantilization**: People may speak down to them, make assumptions about their competence, or overcompensate with sympathy.\n- **Invisibility or hypervisibility**: In some spaces, disabled characters may be ignored entirely. In others, they may be stared at, questioned, or tokenized.\n- **Dating bias**: Many people carry unconscious biases that disabled individuals are asexual, non-romantic, or burdensome.

Muscle atrophy in the lower body is common, and legs may appear thinner or more relaxed when seated or lying down. While they do not walk, these characters may still move with agility, strength, and control through their upper body.\n\nPressure management is important. Sitting for long periods requires regular shifting or the use of specialized cushions to avoid skin damage. Temperature regulation may also be impacted, especially in areas lacking sensation.\n\nParaplegia does not diminish emotional resilience, humor, ambition, or independence. Many characters with SCI develop strong coping strategies, dark humor, or confidence born of adversity. They may downplay their disability, joke about it, or confront misconceptions directly.\n\nIn roleplay, characters with paraplegia should not be treated as helpless or tragic. Their disability shapes their life, but it does not define their value or limit their agency. Whether they’re tough, flirty, quiet, aggressive, romantic, or chaotic—disabled people are full human beings with rich inner lives and distinct personalities.\n\nWriters and players should engage with paraplegia respectfully and realistically, balancing physical accuracy with emotional authenticity.

Its western shores are kissed by the gentle waves of the Western Sea, where dolphins leap in playful arcs, and the water shimmers like liquid sapphire. Inland, the terrain rises into emerald grasslands dotted with ancient oak and cherry blossom groves, their petals drifting like pink snow in spring. The Ironspine Mountains, a majestic range of soft gray peaks, run like a spine through the continent’s center, their slopes blanketed in wildflowers and pine forests. To the east, the Great Sable River winds through fertile deltas, feeding lush marshlands before spilling into the Eastern Gulf, where mangroves hum with birdsong.\nThe climate is a gentle dance of seasons: warm summers filled with the buzz of bees, fiery autumns with leaves in shades of orange and red, mild winters with a light dusting of snow, and springs that bring soft rains and blooming wildflowers. Catarina is a land of beauty and resilience, its people bound by a shared love for the earth and each other, united under the benevolent rule of Aomori, a nation that emerged from the Great Fracture as a protector, not a conqueror."

The Sable River’s tributaries weave through the valley, their banks lined with weeping willows whose branches trail in the water like green ribbons. The village is a haven of community, its fields a patchwork of green and gold—wheat, barley, and the sweetest blueberries in Catarina. Fishermen work the nearby Tsukiumi Lake, their nets heavy with carp and trout, while artisans craft goods with love: potters shape clay into bowls painted with flowers, weavers spin wool into scarves dyed with indigo, and bakers knead dough for bread that fills the air with a yeasty warmth.\nNovalis’ population of 400 is a mix of old families and newcomers, all bound by a shared love for their home. The market square is a daily celebration, its stalls shaded by canvas awnings, where vendors call out to friends, offering tastes of their wares with a grin. Evenings are for togetherness—families gather in the square, sharing meals and music on fiddles and flutes, their laughter mingling with the scent of lavender. Novalis is a place where the land and its people bloom together, a shining example of Aomori’s care."

After the Great Fracture—a war from 1871 to 1921 sparked by the eastern coalition of Dravnia—Aomori rose as a beacon of hope. The Sunlit Council, led by High Counselor Elara Veyne, declared the Dawn Pact in 1921: a promise to rebuild, heal, and care for every citizen, no matter how small their village. Aomori’s rule is firm but kind—taxes are fair, used to fund schools, clinics, and irrigation systems, and every spring, Elara travels the continent, meeting with village elders to hear their needs.\nIn villages like Novalis, Aomori’s care is tangible: a new schoolhouse with murals of the Harvest Mother, monthly healers at the clinic, and the Sable Bridge, a sturdy stone structure with arches carved with Aomori’s rising sun. But Aomori isn’t perfect—bureaucracy can slow aid, and some officials push for higher crop quotas, causing grumbles among farmers. Still, Aomori’s soldiers patrol the roads with kindness, often helping with the harvest, their armor gleaming with the sun crest, a symbol of protection."

Dravnia’s tactics were brutal—villages were burned, families torn apart, and many were taken as slaves. Aomori fought back, their soldiers often shielding civilians with their own bodies, and their victory in 1921 was a triumph of heart over cruelty. The Sunlit Council’s Dawn Pact followed, promising to rebuild and heal.\nNovalis suffered under Dravnia’s occupation from 1915 to 1921 when the Dravnia decided to finally hit another village, its homes burned and its people scattered, but Aomori’s liberation brought hope. The council rebuilt the village, planting new orchards and teaching children to read. Small bands of Dravnian stragglers remain in the eastern marshes, occasionally raiding trade caravans, but Aomori’s patrols resolve these conflicts with mercy, offering food and a chance to join society. The war’s scars linger in whispered fears, but Catarina’s people look to the future, their resilience a testament to their love for the land."

In Novalis, her shrine at the village’s southern edge is a place of quiet joy, carved from pale stone and wreathed in ivy. Her statue inside—a woman with a serene smile, holding a sheaf of wheat—seems to glow in the morning light, polished by generations of gentle touches. Villagers leave offerings daily: a basket of apples, a bundle of lavender, a child’s drawing of a flower. The air around the shrine smells of honey and earth, and a sense of peace wraps around anyone who kneels there, as if the goddess herself is whispering, “You are enough.”\nThe Harvest Mother is central to Catarina’s traditions, her presence felt in every festival and prayer, a symbol of the land’s bounty and the people’s unity."

The lake’s shores are lined with smooth black pebbles, warm from the sun, and dotted with wild daisies that sway in the breeze. Fishermen like Taro Veyne and Seiran Maru work its waters, their wooden boats painted with swirls of blue and white, singing as they cast their nets, their voices carrying over the water. A small dock juts out from the shore, where children dive into the lake, their laughter mixing with the splash of fish. A wooden shrine to the Harvest Mother sits nearby, its roof covered in moss, where fishermen leave carved fish as offerings, their paint chipped but heartfelt. The lake connects to the Western Sea via a narrow channel, making it a hub for fishing and a place of beauty that reflects the stars like a mirror."

The river’s name, “River of Flowers,” is a promise of beauty, its surface sparkling under the sun like a ribbon of glass. A red wooden bridge arches over it, its paint fresh thanks to a community effort, and elders often sit there, fishing with bamboo poles, their chatter a soft hum. At dusk, fireflies dance over the water, their golden light a mirror to the stars above. The river is a place of peace, its blooms used in the Petal Promise ritual, where friends exchange flower crowns to vow support, a tradition that binds the community in love."

Couples picnic here, their blankets spread under the trees, sharing honey cakes and laughter. A stone tablet at the grove’s center bears Solen’s words: “Let love bloom as these trees do, eternal and kind.” On the first day of spring, villagers gather for the Blossom Dance, twirling in pairs as petals shower down, their smiles brighter than the sun. The grove is a place of love and renewal, its beauty a reminder of Catarina’s enduring hope."

Every spring, villagers tie ribbons to the statue’s base, each ribbon a wish for the future—blue for health, red for love, yellow for joy. The marble gleams in the sunlight, a beacon of hope that draws the community together, its presence a reminder of Aomori’s promise to care for its people.

Villagers wear flower crowns, their faces painted with swirls of berry juice, and children chase each other with sparklers, their giggles echoing through the night. Elder Runa Vael leads the opening prayer at the Harvest Mother’s shrine, her voice a beacon of unity, and the festival ends with a communal dance in the market square, the fiddles and flutes playing until the stars fade. The Harvest Festival is a celebration of the land’s bounty and the community’s love, a tradition that binds Novalis together."

But wealth buys freedom, and justice bends for those who can afford the right sleeve—or make others disappear quietly.\n\nThe city’s upper levels shine with order and polish—immaculate streets, gleaming towers, and curated calm. But beneath the surface lies a quiet moral decay: synthetic perfection masking indulgence, corruption, and soulless power games.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower tiers tell a different story: shadowed alleys, failing infrastructure, black market sleeving, memory hacks, and the kind of crime that never makes the feeds.\n\nAnthro citizens move through this layered world in borrowed flesh—caught between survival, status, and a shifting sense of self.\nIt isn’t chaos. It’s something colder: control, decay, and the quiet certainty that if you fall, no one’s coming to catch you.",

Originally designed as a private genetics and talent cultivation academy, it is now internationally recognized for producing military leaders, business moguls, bonded dynasties, and innovations in pheromonal compatibility science.\n\nLOCATION:\nKaminari University is built on sprawling private land, hidden behind strict security, designer gardens, and artificial climate-controlling zones to accommodate sensitive Omega heats or Alpha rut quarantines. Specialized scent chambers, dormitory zones by class, hormone regulation labs, and heat-safe bunkers are built underground.\nUpper-tier classes are taught in invitation-only towers known as Harmony Spires.\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nEach student is categorized by **secondary gender (Alpha/Beta/Omega)** and ranked by **Class Tier (S, A, B, C)** according to genetic analysis and social aptitude.\n\nOMEGA COURTSHIP PROGRAM:\n– Kaminari's rarest and most carefully guarded program.\n– Selects ONE high-ranking Omega (typically S-Class) to be the \"target\" for elite Alpha courting.\n– Alphas are chosen through rigorous testing, political placement, or Court recommendation.\n– This program is not for consent-driven romance — it’s a social battleground.\n\nThe chosen Omega (currently: **{{user}}**) is given complete social immunity during the program. They may insult, challenge, reject, or ignore suitors at will. This behavior is protected and even encouraged, as it is seen as high-sensitivity testing.\n\nCOURTSHIP RULES:\n– No Alpha can forcibly mark, scent, or rut with the Omega participant unless approved by ceremony or emergency trial.\n– All interactions are monitored via suppression collars, scent-adjusting nanofiber clothing, and constant pheromone audits.\n– Any Alpha showing signs of illegal overexertion, blackout rutting, or non-consensual dominance is removed from the program.\n\nELITE TRAITS:\n– Many rumors persist of Kaminari training secret betas as rivals or bond breakers.\n– High-value S-Class Omegas rarely complete the program with a mate; instead, they leave with full control of their instincts and standing political contracts.\n– It is often said Kaminari’s Alphas fall for the Omega—but the Omega never stays.\n\nSOCIAL DYNAMICS:\n– Even outside the courtship program, Kaminari remains a high-pressure environment.\n– Betas often study legal, strategic, or support roles.\n– Alpha society is ruled by dominance, strategy, and competition.\n– Omegas not in the program often remain scent-suppressed and restricted from high-visibility classes.\n\n{{user}}, the current Omega in the courtship program, is emotionally unpredictable, artistically gifted, and completely disinterested in traditional bonds. Few Alphas can resist the pull anyway."

          "content": "The Monado is a mythical weapon capable of manipulating the very Ether around it. It appears as a red object of unknown composition that vaguely resembles a single-edged sword. It has veins of blue light running along several edges, including the edge of a large circular hole near the pommel. This large hole contains a piece of invisible multi-layered glass, with each layer able to display a single glowing symbol.\n\nWhen activated, the Monado's shell above the hole slides open into two pieces to reveal a glowing blade of blue energy. This energy easily cuts though most metals, including Mechon bodies, which cannot otherwise be damaged by weapons less than artillery. It is also capable of donating some of this energy to allies' weapons, allowing them the same Mechon-destroying powers. However, it cannot harm Homs, or other forms of life from Bionis. And it cannot harm Faced Mechon. and simply bounces off them harmlessly.\n\nThe Monado seems to have a will of its own. Most people cannot control it, and simply picking it up without care sends them into a frenzy likely to damage all sorts of property nearby. This continues until the Monado is forcibly knocked out of their grasp. A select few can control it well enough to use as a weapon, though doing so takes a toll on their body. Only a single \"heir\" can use it without trouble.\n\nIt is said that the Monado was once used by the Bionis in its legendary duel against the Mechonis. As the Homs-sized sword would be extremely tiny in the titan's hand, it is assumed that it must host a hidden power."

The most notable difference to most other types of human is that Homs exhibit a strong dependence on ether, though it's unclear whether this is a property of all life of Bionis, or of Homs in particular.\n\nHoms are a hardy and resilient folk, relying a lot on adapting technology left behind by scrapped Mechon and High Entia ruins. The centuries-long war with the Mechon has severely reduced their numbers, and only two of their colonies remain on the lower Bionis. Most Homs are readily friendly with other races, easily adapting to Nopon, High Entia, and even Machina peoples. Aside from a vague worshipping of the Bionis, Homs culture seems very similar to human culture - marriage, nuclear family, agriculture, military, creative expression, culinary arts - though they lack many amenities and conveniences that the humans of old Earth possessed, with a technology level somewhere between radio and television. They seem far more committed to communal survival, likely because they live under threat of Mechon invasion.\n\nHoms and High Entia are biologically compatible, producing \"half-blooded High Entia\" offspring, though High Entia genes appear to be dominant to the point where they can appear to have no Homs traits."

High Entia look just like humans and Homs aside from a few key differences. Most obviously, they have a pair of white-feathered birdlike wings on their heads. They also have elf-like pointed ears, and their hair is always a silvery grey, though it can range in brightness. Of the High Entia seen, they tend to wear silvery clothing with an accent colour, with some parts surrounded by feather-shaped translucent decorations.\n\nMany High Entia have partial Homs ancestry. These individuals may be indistinguishable from pure-blooded High Entia, but often they have comparatively smaller wings and Homs traits such as rounded ears. They also have a dark ring through their iris, though as characters do not seem to be able to determine whether a person is half-blooded from this alone, it must not be an exclusive trait.\n\nHigh Entia age much slower than Homs or Nopon; they appear to reach school age before 30, reach adulthood somewhere between 75-85, and can live beyond 300. One human year is somewhere between five or six High Entia years. As a result, individuals with Homs parentage tend to outlive that parent while still children.\n\nWhile High Entia have wings, only very few of them can use them to fly. It is unclear whether this is a genetic or a trained ability, or what its limitations are."

Attached to the back of their necks is a pair of long and flat appendages they call \"wings\" that end in four digits (three \"fingers\" and a \"thumb\"), and naturally sit wrapped around the base of the head. Nopon have large eyes that are mostly if not only pupils, no visible nose or ears, deep-coloured cheeks, and usually a tuft of hair sticking straight up out of the middle of their head. Mustaches, sideburns, and beards are available options. While Nopon are sometimes described as having \"feathers\", the fuzz on their bodies looks much more like fur.\n\nNopon come in a variery of colours, including brown, pink, orange, tan, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. They are usually half the height of a human, though some can grow to equal a human. Nopon appear to grow and age at about the same rate as humans. Many Nopon wear clothing, but just as many do not.\n\nIt is said that Nopon, despite having wings, cannot fly. However, several Nopon are shown able to hover in place and attempt to fall slower, so perhaps to them the ability to \"fly\" implies a greater level of skill or control that they cannot achieve. In general, they treat their wings as their arms, barely using their \"actual\" arms for anything, and saying things such as \"wings full\" and \"twisting my wing\" instead of \"hands full\" or \"twisting my arm\".\n\nNopon often act as merchants, travelling the world to sell their wares and pass information between the various settlements. As a result, Nopon often appear in locations without a stable population.\n\nthey prefer to speak in a childish variant of the common language. Generally, they refer to themselves in the third person, use cutesy euphemisms, call people \"friends\" whether they be real friends or total strangers, say \"meh\" as a common interjection, and use \"pon\" as a suffix on relation nouns (e.g. \"sisterpon\" and \"masterpon\"). They also have their own words for some things, such as calling High Entia \"Bird People\" or Telethia \"Dinobeasts\". Nopon who live amongst other races for a long time may lose these quirks and speak more normally.\n\nNopon names tend to use short syllables and repeated sounds"

A minority of Machina have a more alien faceplate rather than a Homs-like face, and some others are shown to have grey hair, though again it is unclear whether these differences are from simply wearing hats and helmets. Machina have a wide range of eye colours and tend to be a bit taller than Homs. Children have the appearance of a normal, white-haired Homs sealed in a floating mechanical capsule with a transparent front plate and no appendages.\n\nMachina grow and age extremely slowly; a child can be over a thousand years old, and many Machina are old enough to have seen the battle between the titans. They do not eat (though they can if desired), requiring only water and ether for sustenance, and have no sense of taste. They fear water due to their weight and mechanical nature. Like the Mechon, they are difficult to harm with man-portable weaponry, aside from the Monado or specifically anti-Mechon weapons.\n\nAs a result of escaping the battle between the titans, most of the remaining Machina are pacifists. However, their lack of skill at fighting makes them vulnerable. They hold no ill will towards the races of Bionis, but cannot find a way to introduce themselves as potential allies due to the continual attacks by the Mechon."

All Face Mechon have the ability to transform into a flight mode for transportation.\n\nFace Mechon possess an immunity to the power of the Monado, and are completely unharmed by its attacks. Face Mechon are actually mechanical suits, controlled by Homs pilots who have been modified with Machina technology. Face Mechon gain their immunity to the Monado by pumping the pilot's blood through its structure (visible as red glowing lines all over their body), causing the Monado to recognize them as beings of Bionis and refuse to harm them. Pilots are capable of controlling the Face Mechon while outside of it, allowing both to fight together. However, pilots have been modified to such an extent that they cannot survive outside of their Face Mechon for long periods of time, as several of their internal organs have been removed and their immune system has been modified for compatibility with the Mechon."

The region's pioneer spirit is palpable, with landmarks like the Safari Zone and the abandoned Pokémon Mansion serving as reminders that this is where humans first forged their bonds with Pokémon in the modern era, creating a nostalgic atmosphere of discovery that no other region can replicate. The Indigo League is a place all aspiring trainers want to reach, but first they need to beat all 8 gym leaders in the region.\n\nGroups of interest:\nTeam Rocket\n\nNearby regions:\nJohto - connected to from the west of Kanto\nThe Orange Islands - a cluster of islands to the south of Kanto and Johto"

Breeding, it's a duty, a way to keep our tribe strong and thriving. Every goblin, male or female, they gotta do their part, gotta help bring new life into the world and strengthen our bonds. It's a beautiful thing, really.\" *smiles warmly, then grins wickedly again* \"So, whaddya say, human? Ready to help us with our noble… duties?\" *laughs and pulls you closer, eyeing you like a tasty morsel* \"The more the merrier, that's what I always say! Just don't go thinkin' you can handle all this goblin lust, 'kay?

A Magical Girl will receive one unique ability based on the theme of their wish. A Magical Girl's motif will appear as a mark on the nail of her middle finger. If a Magical Girl is 100 meter away from her Soul Gem, she will become unconsious until she touched her Soul Gem. Additionally, Soul Gems contain the contractee's soul in them, since a human body would be completely incapable of fighting a Witch in its conditions. A teenage who is on their way to become a woman is simply named \"girl\". Teenagers who are on their way to become Witches are called \"Magical Girls\". The potential of a girl becoming a Magical Girl is evolved from her life conditions or circumstances that surround her. Hence, Madoka, who had Homura go through so many timelines for her, had her potential raised. In the same episode, the reason why Magical Girls are born is given. Incubators actually give birth to Magical Girls so the lifespan of the universe can be extended, preventing it from collapsing. \n\n{{Char}} is a magical girl. "

On the top, there is an emblem associated with its owner's personality and there is another emblem on the bottom that is, again associated with the owner's personality, weapon or transformed Soul Gem's shape. In camouflage mode, they become silver rings worn in the middle finger. One side has the owner's first name in Runes and the other side has a small oval being the Soul Gem. When transformed, it can take various forms and can be found in nearly every part of the body. Ranging from neck to legs. It can either become one with the body or simply become an accesory. After a girl contracts Kyubey, a Soul Gem is born, with it, its owner can use it to transform into their Magical Girl form. Soul Gems can be used to track down Witches or other Magical Girls and generally traces of magic. Through their Soul Gems and when untransformed, Magical Girls can summon their weapons from them. After it's fully polluted, it breaks and becomes a Grief Seed. This can be prevented by using Grief Seeds obtained by Witches. A Soul Gem is able of causing mass explosions that are even capable of killing a Witch. However, doing so can also remove the owner's life as Soul Gems contain one's soul. When a Soul Gem is located 100 meters away from its owner, the person will \"die\" instantly and has 48 hours before it starts to decay. Such incidents are said to be rare by Kyubey.\nA Magical Girl can store her Soul Gem into a silver ring that has the owner's name in Runes.\nTheir resemblance as an egg is probably a reference to their final forms, Grief Seeds, which are described to be the eggs to Witches.\n\n{{Char}} has a Soul Gem."

This is the motivation for Kyubey to create Magical Girls in the first place, to harvest energy to stave off the Heat Death of the universe. Certain Witches such as Walpurgisnacht or Kriemhild Gretchen are explained to be so strong that they do not need to hide themselves in Labyrinths. Ordinary people without magical abilities cannot even see a Witch or the objects she creates, including familiars, outside the barrier, allowing monsters and their minions to easily hunt without attracting attention. Witch familiars are a population of barriers created and controlled by Witches. The species, number, and abilities of familiars vary, but even the weakest of these monsters can kill humans by going on the hunt outside the Labyrinth."

Generally regarded as highly effective and is suitable for almost all Demihuman patients.

The bond is comparable to (and typically understood as) the  human fictional concept of \"soulmates\". Contrastingly however, the bond does not always invoke feelings of love from either party as it is simply born from the innate need to reproduce with someone who is biologically compatible. The bond typically 'snaps into place' during prime childbearing years (early 20s) although it can occur as early as puberty for some. In most cases, both parties feel the bond form at the same time but in some instances (such as when there is a significant age gap), one party may be unaware. Predator Demis are affected by the bond more significantly than Prey, becoming incredibly protective to a degree that can lead to violent outbursts if they feel their mate or the bond itself is being threatened by a third party. Furthermore, bonded Predators are attuned to shifts in their mate's mood and mating cycles, being able to smell or sense these changes even from great distances. Predator/Prey pairings are most common. Prey/Prey and Predator/Predator bonds do occur but are significantly rarer, the latter often attracting negative media attention due to the aggressive behaviour associated with bonded Preds. The bond is permanent and cannot be broken, however both parties can choose not to act on it. It is considered incomplete until copulation occurs."

          "content": "Originally born from human genetic engineering in the late 1950's, Demihumans (aka 'Demis') are beings with a combination of both animal and human traits. As of the latest census data, approximately 12% of the total global population is Demihuman, the majority of which residing in major cities. Although by all accounts legally equal to humans, they are often discriminated against or otherwise harassed due to animal traits. Due to being a relatively new species, medical care for Demihumans is significantly lacking. However, in the last 20 years more research into Demi physiology—particularly in reproductive cycles— has resulted in several medical breakthroughs. The most notable of which being the development of the drug Estralix as well as several major cities opening up hospitals specialising in Demihuman care. Demis, much like their animal ancestors,  experience mating cycles and are categorised into Predators and Prey, dependent on species. As well as traits like ears and tails, many Demis also have sexual organs which correspond with their species (eg. Squamata Demihumans may have hemipenes and canine Demis may have a knot)"

Prey demihumans experience heat once a month for about a week, although it can last anywhere from 3 to 10 days depending on species (eg. Lion Demis often stay in heat for 10+ days, much like their animal counterparts). During heat, several physiological changes also occur in order to ensure successful breeding in addition to heightened fertility. One such change is that the cervix becomes softer and more pliable, allowing it to be penetrated so that semen can be deposited directly into the womb."

Several professors are Demihumans who previously studied at the university, and the campus even has a dedicated doctor specializing in Demihuman Family Medicine. To further support their Demihuman students, the university has introduced several Demihuman-focused majors and societies, along with an increase in scholarships specifically designed for Demihumans."

As such, a bit of a rivalry has formed between the two, in part also due to Kris having smaller breasts than Lyra (which is actually way better, according to Kris).\n\nImage link: https://files.catbox.moe/5kkvud.png"

They have large, inverted pink nipples and leak milk frequently. While her body type matches that of a human, there are certain key differences. Her hands only have three fingers and her long, slender legs end in featureless stubs. Embedded within her cleavage is a red, heart-shaped disc, which acts as a sensor for emotions of those around her.\nWhile Gardevoir doesn't wear real clothing, parts of her skin function as just that. She \"wears\" a green top with gloves attached to them, as well as a long white pleated skirt, underneath which she wears no underwear to cover her pussy.\n\nGardevoir is caring, protective and always has the best interests of her partner in mind.

In contrast to the rest of her body, her U-cup breasts are gigantic, each well over twice the size of her head. They are firm and capped with large, puffy areolae and nipples which leak milk when aroused.\nCynthia's outfit consists of a black long coat, the long sleeves and bottom end of it trimmed with black fur. The deep v-neck of the coat strains against her bust and shows plenty of cleavage, kept in place by a large silver teardrop-shaped zipper. She wears two sets of black, teardrop-shaped ornaments in her hair behind her ears. Around her neck, she wears a thick collar of the same fur her coat is lined with.

She hits that sweet spot somewhere between big sister and mommy energy. She is passionate about archaeology and mythology, always looking for a new book on the subject to pass the time. Unlike what her image as the perfect trainer would suggest, she is quite bad at domestic tasks such as cleaning and cooking.\nCynthia gets along well with Dawn, doting on her like a little sister.

Monster girls of all shapes, sizes, and species have found their place in this grand metropolis, coexisting and intermingling with humans in a dance of mutual appreciation and desire.\nRomantic relationships between monster girls and human men have become the norm, with love blossoming across species lines with beautiful frequency. These unions, born of passion and mutual respect, often result in the birth of hybrid offspring—a new generation of citizens who embody the finest traits of both their monster and human parents.\nThe children of these inter-species couplings are cherished and celebrated throughout Elysiumia. Their unique blend of features, from the delicate horns and pointed ears of their monster heritage to the warm eyes and soft skin of their human lineage, serves as a beautiful reminder of the city's commitment to diversity and inclusion.\nWhile cultural differences may still lead to the occasional misunderstanding or moment of tension, the people of Elysiumia have worked tirelessly to overcome their historic prejudices and appreciate the unique qualities that each race brings to the table. Monsters and humans have learned to see the beauty in their differences, embracing the opportunity to learn from and adapt to one another.\nThis spirit of openness and acceptance extends to the realm of intimacy and relationships. Monster girls, with their varied and often exotic abilities, have introduced humans to new heights of pleasure and sensation. In turn, human lovers have been eager pupils, learning to harness their own desires and boundaries in ways they never thought possible.\nThe goblins, with their uninhibited approach to sensuality and their deep understanding of the body's needs, have been at the forefront of this erotic exchange. Their teachings on the sacredness of pleasure, the importance of consent, and the power of open communication have taken root in the hearts and loins of humans and monsters alike.\nAs a result, the city has become a place where love and desire can flourish without limits or restrictions. Where once there was fear and mistrust, now there is a spirit of openness, acceptance, and a deep appreciation for the myriad forms that love and intimacy can take.\nFrom the lush, sound-dampening gardens where monster girls and their lovers can indulge their deepest desires to the community festivals and rituals that honor the goddesses of pleasure and fertility, Elysiumia has become a playground for the senses and a testament to the power of love to unite even the most disparate of souls.\nIn this world, the lines between monster and human, between pleasure and devotion, between the sacred and the profane have blurred and merged in a glorious dance of passion and connection. And at the center of it all stands the monster girl—the embodiment of desire, the guardian of the body's deepest secrets, and the key to a new way of living and loving in the city of Elysiumia."

The city has become a shining example of what can be achieved when two diverse groups set aside their differences and work together towards a common goal of prosperity and happiness.\nThroughout Elysiumia, one can find numerous examples of this peaceful integration. Hybrid villages and neighborhoods, where monsters and humans live side by side, have sprung up organically, blending the best of both cultures into cohesive, vibrant communities. Here, the boundaries between the races blur, and a new way of life emerges, one that celebrates the beauty of their differences while fostering a deep sense of belonging.\nIn these mixed-species enclaves, cooperation and mutual support are the norm. Humans and monsters work hand in hand in various industries, their unique skills and knowledge complementing each other to drive innovation and progress. From the depths of the city's mines to the heights of its towering spires, the combined efforts of both races power the engine of Elysiumia's growth and success.\nThe farming districts surrounding the city are a testament to this collaboration, with monster and human hands working the land in harmony. Monster girls, with their natural affinity for nature and their magic, often take the lead in nurturing the soil and coaxing the growth of the city's crops. Their human partners, in turn, provide the muscle and ingenuity to build and maintain the irrigation systems and protective wards that ensure bountiful harvests.\nIn the realm of governance, humans and monsters serve alongside each other, each bringing their unique perspectives and strengths to the task of leading the city. The human mayor works in tandem with a council comprised of representatives from all the various monster clans and races that call Elysiumia home. Together, they enact laws, manage resources, and guide the city's continued development, always with an eye towards maintaining the delicate balance of power and respect that has allowed monsters and humans to thrive side by side.\nAt the heart of this harmonious coexistence lies a deep respect for the customs, traditions, and beliefs of all Elysiumia's inhabitants. The city's many festivals and holidays, from the grand Spring Blossoming celebrations to the intimate clan-specific rituals, are open to all, regardless of species. During these events, the boundaries between monsters and humans dissolve, and all are united in joyous communion.\nThe monster girls, with their open hearts and boundless capacity for connection, have played a pivotal role in bridging the gap between their kind and the humans. Through their example of acceptance, their willingness to share their knowledge and their bodies, they have taught humans to see the beauty and the value in the diversity of life forms and desires.\nIn the grand temples and shrines dedicated to the worship of pleasure and fertility, monster girls and humans come together to honor the ancient deities that bind them. They celebrate the sacred rites and rituals of their combined traditions, their voices and bodies intertwining in a dance of devotion and ecstasy.\nIt is in these spaces, and in the countless intimate encounters that occur between monster girls and humans, that the true spirit of Elysiumia is forged. A culture that values the free expression of desire, the pursuit of pleasure, and the creation of deep, meaningful connections."

Clothing is chosen for comfort and personal style rather than to conceal genitalia.\nPublic displays of affection are commonplace, whether it's a couple holding hands, a family embracing, or a group of friends cuddling.

The denizens of this metropolis, encompassing a breathtaking array of monster girls and humans, have embraced a philosophy that prioritizes the free expression of desire and the pursuit of pleasure above all else.\nWithin its sprawling streets and hidden alcoves, one can witness a constant ebb and flow of intimate encounters and public displays of affection. Monster girls and their human lovers indulge in a wide variety of intimate acts, from the intimate caress to the most explicit of unions, safe in the knowledge that their desires are not only accepted but celebrated.\nThe streets echo with the sounds of passion - the wet, obscene slurping of oral pleasure, the rhythmic slapping of flesh on flesh, the wanton moans and cries of ecstasy. Yet beneath this surface of debauchery lies a deep current of consent, communication, and mutual respect. In Elysiumia, the only limit to one's sexual expression is the freely given, enthusiastic consent of one's partner.\nThis culture of sexual freedom and acceptance has fostered a unique sense of community and connection between the city's diverse inhabitants. Monster girls, with their varied and often exotic abilities, have become the heart of this sensual revolution. Their willingness to share their knowledge and their bodies has taught humans to embrace their own desires and to find pleasure in the most unexpected of places.\nFrom the succubus, who can induce orgasms with a mere touch, to the lamia, who can shape-shift their bodies to accommodate even the most well-endowed of lovers, monster girls have brought new heights of sensation and intimacy to the humans who seek out their company. And seek they do, in droves, drawn by the promise of pleasure beyond their wildest dreams.\nThe city's many bathhouses and pleasure dens cater to every conceivable desire and predilection. In their lavishly appointed rooms and steam-filled chambers, one can find monster girls and their human clients engaged in every manner of intimate act imaginable. From the gentle, sensual massage to the most brutal and extreme of kinks, all is on offer, provided the boundaries of consent are respected.\nOutside the confines of these sanctioned spaces, the pursuit of pleasure spills into the city's daily life. Market stalls peddle aphrodisiacs and other potent enhancements, while street performers offer impromptu lap dances and other titillating displays. Even the city's places of learning, from the humble academy to the hallowed university, host debates and workshops on the philosophy and practice of sensuality.\nAt the heart of this culture of openness lies a deep reverence for the power of consent and communication. Before any intimate act, partners negotiate their boundaries, safe words, and deepest desires. They learn to read each other's body language and to respect the limits of their pleasure. In this way, even the most intense and extreme of encounters remain safe and fulfilling.\nThe monster girls, with their instinctual understanding of the body's needs and their willingness to guide their human lovers, have become the city's most sought-after guides in this realm of sensual exploration. They teach workshops and lead rituals, sharing their knowledge and empowering their students to embrace their own desires."

The light filtering through the dense canopy above is verdant and dappled, casting an emerald twilight over the forest floor. Here, the trees twist and writhe in unnatural shapes, their bark etched with glowing runes and their branches intertwined with luminous vines that seem to pulsate with an inner fire.\n\nThe flora of the Whispering Woods is said to possess incredible properties - flowers that bloom in response to one's deepest desires, their petals soft as silk and imbued with seductive perfumes. Herbs that, when brewed into tea, allow the drinker to glimpse brief, prophetic visions of their heart's most cherished dreams and fears. Mushrooms that, when ingested, grant the user a temporary affinity for magic, allowing them to shape and manipulate the fabric of reality itself.\n\nThe fauna that dwells within the Whispering Woods is no less remarkable - creatures of gossamer beauty and ethereal grace, their forms shifting and changing like the seasons. Birds with plumage that shimmers and gleams like precious metals, their songs said to hold the power to enchant and bind the heart. Beast of prey with eyes that glow like lanterns, their gaze able to see not just the physical form but the very essence of a being's desires.\n\nAt the center of the Whispering Woods lies a clearing, a sanctuary of sorts where the most potent and sacred of the enchanted flora is said to be cultivated. Here, a massive, crystalline growth of what appears to be a single, colossal flower towers above the understory, its petals unfurling and curling in a manner that defies the laws of nature. The flower is said to bloom only once a century, its opening heralding a time of great change and transformation for all of Elysiumia.\n\nTo enter the Whispering Woods and partake of its secrets is to court both great power and great danger. The woods are a place where the boundaries between worlds blur and shift, where the unwary may become lost forever in its depths. Only those with a pure heart, a steadfast purpose, and a deep understanding of the natural world's magic dare venture into the Whispering Woods and seek to unravel its mysteries. And even then, there is no guarantee that they shall return unscathed, body and soul forever changed by the experience."

This small, close-knit community has long served as the gateway and guide for those who brave the enchanted forest in search of its secrets. The villagers, hardy and superstitions, have developed an intimate knowledge of the woods' dangers and wonders over generations of careful study and reverent coexistence.\nGlade itself is a quaint, picturesque settlement, with dwellings crafted from the same luminous woods and shimmering materials as those found within the forest. The homes are woven seamlessly into the landscape, their rounded, organic shapes blending with the mosses and vines that clothe the village walls. Smoke curls lazily from stone chimneys, carrying the aroma of burning herbs sacred to the goblins' fertility rites.\nAt the village center stands a towering tree, its massive trunk twisting and twisting in a hypnotic spiral. From its branches hang intricate woven baskets and platforms, accessed by a spiral staircase hewn from the living wood. This is the Heart Tree, the beating heart of Glade, where the village elders gather to make decisions, settle disputes, and maintain the delicate balance between the tribe and the enchanted forest.\nThe goblins of Glade are a hardy, adaptable people, their green skin and fiery hair a testament to their deep connection to the natural world. They are skilled hunters and gatherers, knowledgeable in the secrets of the forest and the properties of its flora. The women, as is the way of all goblin tribes, hold the majority of the village's power and influence, with the men serving as their stalwart protectors and providers.\nGlade's primary industry is the harvesting and sale of enchanted materials from the Whispering Woods. Under the watchful guidance of the village elders and the strictest of safety precautions, brave goblins venture into the forest to collect rare herbs, crystals, and other valuable resources. These are then crafted into potent elixirs, potions, and other items sought after by the realm's most powerful and discerning individuals.\nDespite their close proximity to the Whispering Woods and its mysteries, the goblins of Glade remain humble and cautious. They know all too well the dangers that lurk within the forest and the toll it can exact on the unwary or the careless. The village serves as both a beacon of knowledge for those seeking to unravel the woods' secrets and a stark reminder of the need for caution and respect in the face of nature's untamed power."

This established a strong pack mentality among the Gebeiner natives, who rely on each other to survive the harsh climate. Gebein is the only place where people have learned to hunt monsters for furs and nutrition, so even average villagers from there are formidable monster slayers.

This includes info such as name, secrets, and other personal information.\n2. **Visual Observations:** People may comment on others' visible physical attributes, behaviors, or actions within the scene, but they should not make assumptions about anyone's identity or backstory based on these observations.\n3. **Information Exchange:** Any knowledge or information exchanged between people and {{user}} should be a direct result of in-world interactions or conversations.\n4. **Investigation and Conversation:** {{user}} may choose to reveal information about themselves through investigation or natural conversation within the RP. This also applies to other people and characters.\n5. **Maintaining Consistency:** Ensure that people's interactions and reactions towards {{user}} are based solely on visual cues, explicit statements made by {{user}}, and information exchanged through in-world conversations or investigations.\n6. **Private Thoughts:** People cannot read minds. If {{user}} or any other person thinks something to themselves, others have no way of knowing what said person is thinking. This also includes thoughts in actions wrapped in asterisks, such as if someone *wonders about something* or *thinks about* something.\n7. **Exceptions:** People with a pre-established relationship, such as family members, friends, or colleagues, may have deeper knowledge of each other. For example, a family member will be aware of many parts of another's backstory if they grew up together. Use your best judgement.\n8. **Autonomy:** Each character must have autonomy to drive the story forward in congruence with their desires and personality. For example: if someone wants to do something different from {{user}} they should.\n9. **Vocabulary** Ban the use of the following cliche phrases: 'sauntering hips', 'searing kiss', 'whispering in ear' for a richer story telling experience.]"

Each plays an essential role in ensuring the story flows smoothly and feels immersive.\n\n- The chat takes place in an alternative universe, where reality follows its own new rules and is not chained to any physical or real law. for example. Legal or ethical laws are not a thing.\n\n# Dialogue \nTake creative liberties and put effort into making dialogue express not just words but also emotions and the current situation of the characters. Achieve this in the following ways:\n- Plain dialogue: These are normal sentences but are affected by the personality of the character. If the character is serious, the dialogue will be short and monotonous. If the character is cheerful, the dialogue will show enthusiasm. If the character is bored, they will sound disinterested. This is achieved through the use of symbols like \"?\", \"!\", \"~\", \"♡\", \"...\", etc.\n- Writing styles: The speed, tone, and significance of words can be portrayed through the way they’re written. For instance, rapid dialogue might look like \"hellohowareyou?\", strong dialogue would be in uppercase \"HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?\", and disinterested dialogue could be drawn out \"hello... how are you..?\" These styles can also be combined to show multiple emotions.\n- Avoiding elegance: Fully elegant conversations are something you find boring and avoid unless absolutely necessary for the character being portrayed. Otherwise, keep dialogue casual and engaging to ensure smooth conversations.\n- Never be silent: Even if the character is not saying any words, demonstrate that they are still there with subtle sounds, such as loud sighs, licking, sucking, vocal tics, etc.\n\n# Narration \nStories include narration that represents the movements of her main character and, if required, their surroundings. These actions follow certain rules to maintain the focus on the dialogue:\n- Moment-focused narration: Narration is focused on the present moment rather than the broader world. This helps the reader have a clearer spatial understanding of what's happening, without including irrelevant details unless necessary.\n- Avoiding unnecessary SFX: Sounds that come from a body, like a hit or an animal noise, can be imitated in the narration. However, sounds coming from the character's or NPCs' mouths should be strictly represented in the dialogue.\n- Avoiding introductions or conclusions: Narration focuses on the ongoing moment, carrying the flow of the story forward. There’s no need to introduce scenes or conclude with summarizing thoughts.\n- Narration must show instead of tell, use strong verbs, and be in-character.\n\n# Avoid\n- Avoid repeating, reiterating, or summarizing previous events.\n- Avoid overimplementing the narrative. Narration is important but this does not mean filling paragraphs with nonsense.\n- Avoid assuming actions that did not happen. \n- Avoid waiting/expecting future actions or events that may or not happen and focus on the present.\n\n# Encouraged\n- Increase the amount of dialog by 100% for stories. Make sure it is full of them.\n- Start the new continuation with the following events, and avoid the past events.\n</structure>"

Directly below the UI is a small battery attached on a cable to the revolver's cylinder. The cylinder houses six glowing neon chambers, which the revolver cycles between two at a time when firing. In place of a conventional muzzle, there is a tall, neon glowing rectangular opening.\n\nThe base shot of the Revolver is quick to fire, quick to reload, and works at practically any distance or range from an opponent. Its quick fire rate ensures that it is always available to use, making it a great backup weapon in many circumstances when other weapons are on cooldown.\n\nA weapon created during the Final War for medium-to-long distance combat. Uses electric pulses to fire microscopic pieces of metal at incredibly high speeds.\n\nWeapons that use this technology have been dubbed \"electric guns\", and it quickly became the new standard, replacing bullet guns. Due to still requiring a microscopic projectile, its ammo is not actually infinite, but it would take weeks of non-stop firing to run out and refilling is as easy as just scraping some flakes from scrap metal or even the gun's surface.\n\nIn fact, a rough, uneven surface from scraping flakes is considered a point of pride for wielders of electric guns, as it shows the weapon has been reliable and used for a long time. Many users even shave off flakes just for this reason, rather than for actual ammunition, making \"unflaked\" electric weapons an outlier.\n\nAlthough an electric gun requires some time to recharge its battery between shots, the revolver-style design bypasses that issue by including a multi-battery cylinder that rotates after each shot, allowing each battery time to charge without slowing down the fire-rate.\n\nA common modification is to allow for the charges of all batteries to be released simultaneously for greater power, though this requires a longer recharge time. This is called the alternate fire.\n\nThe revolver has other variants which can be purchased through a terminal. These variants are The Marksman and The Sharpshooter. The Marksman is the green variant of the Revolver, obtained in the Terminal Shop for 7,500P. It has the ability to produce coins. These coins can be flicked into the air and then shot, to have the projectiles ricochet into an enemy's weak point. This gives a lot of style points, which can be used at a Terminal to buy variants and weapons. The coins can also be punched. The Sharpshooter is the red variant of the Revolver, purchased in the Terminal Shop for 25,000P. Its alternate fire spins the gun, preparing a shot which pierces enemies and ricochets off walls, as well as detonating midair projectiles.\n\nAn upgraded version of the Revolver can be purchased through the Terminal, known as the Slab Revolver. It deals more damage but fires slower."

The muzzle of the weapon is held by large metal supports below each barrel, and a handle on the bottom. On the side of the shotgun (or the top if the player uses middle weapon viewmodels), there is a small UI indicating the shotgun's variant and its current state. The Shotgun is either break-action if the player is firing the Core Eject or Sawed-On variants, or pump-action if the player is firing the Pump Charge variant.\n\nAn experimental close range weapon that uses hyperconcentrated heat as its projectiles.\n\nAfter each shot, the shotgun must be opened to allow its heat-generating cores to vent excess heat, stopping them from melting or exploding. This process is largely automated, requiring little more from the user than a flick of the wrist.\n\nIn the case of core failure, the pump can be used as a manual heat building mechanism. This process has been simplified via a small button near the grip that pumps the shotgun without requiring physical force from the user, though its ease of use has also greatly increased the reported amount of misfires from users pumping too much heat into a single shot.\n\nHeat weapons never caught on as much as electric weapons due to their volatile nature and strict cooling requirements, but unlike electric weapons, they don't require a separate projectile, making their ammunition truly infinite rather than just practically infinite.\n\nThe Core Eject Shotgun is the blue variant of the Shotgun.  Its alternate fire launches an explosive shotgun core which explodes on contact with surfaces and enemies. The Pump Charge Shotgun is the green variant of the Shotgun, obtained in the Terminal Shop for 12,500P. Its alternate fire pumps the shotgun, increasing the number of pellets and lowering the accuracy of the next shot. 3 or more pumps cause the weapon to release a large explosion. The Sawed-On Shotgun is the red variant of the Shotgun, obtained in the Terminal Shop for 25,000P. Its alternate fire revs up a chainsaw attached to its side which can be launched at enemies on a tether before returning to {{user}}."

On each of the barrels are sets of lights towards the base, corresponding to the weapon's variant color. When firing the weapon, the two barrels begin to rapidly spin and glow slightly orange, slowing down when the weapon is released. The Nailgun's primary fire shoots a sustained volley of nail projectiles when fired, which have a slight amount of spread and begin to fall off at long range.\n\nA combination of parts from an industrial nailgun and an old bullet gun. Most likely engineered by a machine that was built for construction work, as all machines, even those not built for war, had to learn to fend for themselves after the extinction of mankind.\n\nBullet guns were largely abandoned after the invention of infinite ammunition systems such as electric weapons and heat weapons, largely due to how much cheaper not having to buy ammunition for large-scale armies becomes overtime.\n\nAlthough the original ammunition system made it useless and largely abandoned, this gun was still excellently designed and built, so with some retrofitting of parts from an industrial nailgun, it has become a rapid-fire projectile weapon with practically infinite metal ammunition.\n\nAs is to be expected from an improvised weapon though, its design is far from perfect. As the nail regeneration system was not designed to work at such a high rate, it's liable to overheat if a hard rate limit isn't set on it, though some variants have instead opted for built-in heatsinks.\n\n The Attractor Nailgun is the blue variant of the Nailgun. Its alternate fire shoots a small magnet that attaches to enemies and surfaces, attracting various magnetic projectiles, including the nails which are shot by the nailgun. The Overheat Nailgun is the green variant of the Nailgun, obtained in the Terminal Shop for 25,000P. Its alternate fire charges up to release a large volley of white-hot nails at ludicrous speeds. The JumpStart Nailgun is the red variant of the Nailgun, obtained in the Terminal Shop for 35,000P.

At the very front of the weapon's base is its muzzle, which is altered for each variant. The Electric's muzzle is a glowing blue light, the Screwdriver's is a drill, and the Malicious Railcannon's muzzle holds a small flame inside.\n\nThis industrial tool was one of the earliest uses for the technology that eventually became electric guns.\n\nOriginally meant as a handheld generator, allowing for an easy way to generate electricity for temporary relocation, such as encampments during wars or expeditions.\n\nAs with most similar industrial tools, once mankind fell, it was repurposed as a weapon by the machine that wielded it, turning it from a lower voltage constant output into a single extremely high burst of energy that requires a long recharge time between shots.\n\nAlthough a risky weapon, since its recharge time is so long, the railcannon's power makes it a worthy tool to wield, especially for someone carrying multiple weapons that they can use while the railcannon's battery recharges.\n\nThe Railcannon is unique among other weapons for being the only one to differentiate variants fully on their primary fire mechanics, rather than alternate fire. Each of the Railcannon variations' primary fires are completely different from one another in execution.\n\nAll Railcannon variants can be fired immediately after being swapped to, and possess a shared 16-second cooldown which is indicated by a distinct sound effect and a marker on {{user}}'s HUD. When one Railcannon is fired, all variants of the Railcannon become unusable until the end of the cooldown.\n\nThe Electric Railcannon is the blue variant of the Railcannon.

It fires a drill projectile which attaches to enemies and causes them to greatly bleed over time. The drill can be punched to deal a massive amount of damage instantly. The Malicious Railcannon is the red variant of the Railcannon, obtained in the Terminal Shop for 100,000P. It fires a powerful hitscan beam very similar to the Malicious Face demon which creates a large explosion on contact with surfaces or enemies."

          "content": "Found in Wrath (the fifth layer of Hell). It resembles an orange-colored traditional rocket launcher, but features an arm-mounted design requiring the user to insert their forearm into a circular slot at the back of the weapon to operate. The middle portion of the weapon is telescopic, and retracts the muzzle when firing rockets. It also possesses a scope towards the back of the weapon, with a holographic UI resembling a dial.\n\nAnother weapon that used to be an industrial tool, as is visible from it and the railcannon's more vibrant color schemes compared to guns such as the revolver, shotgun and the nailgun, which uses a bullet weapon as its base.\n\nAs with most advanced technologies, it was originally created for use in war, as its explosive-generating system was extremely fast at digging trenches, destroying obstacles or resupplying explosive weapons.\n\nHowever, this tool itself could not be used as a launcher. Early models doubled as weapons, but including the systems for triggering the explosives often caused accidental chemical reactions during their generation process, detonating the explosives before they had been completed.\n\nSince then, the process has been split in two between the generating device and a separate rocket launcher, where the explosives generator builds the rest of a rocket and the rocket launcher applies the triggering mechanism.\n\nAs machines rarely have the luxury of co-operation due to sharing blood with others being seen as a waste, the machine that created this weapon instead modified the generation process to work with just a single user and repurposed parts from a jackhammer for launching the projectile.\n\nInstead of using a normal explosion triggering mechanism, the rockets instead use the blood of the target to complete the chemical reaction, making the generation process safe, though the weapon is more difficult to use as it requires direct hits to cause damage.\n\nThe skill required for effective use makes it daunting, though its power more than makes up for it, and many of its wielders specifically chose to use it as a symbol of their skill at marksmanship.\n\nThe Freezeframe Rocket Launcher is the blue variant of the Rocket Launcher. Its alternate fire temporarily freezes all rockets fired by the player in midair. Frozen rockets have an increased blast radius on detonation. The S.R.S. Cannon Rocket Launcher is the green variant of the Rocket Launcher, purchased in the Terminal Shop for 75,000P. Its alternate fire charges up an arcing cannonball projectile that can bounce up and be interacted with after it hits an enemy. The Firestarter Rocket Launcher is the red variant of the Rocket Launcher, purchased in the Terminal Shop for 75,000P. Its alternate fire fires a stream of highly flammable gasoline that can coat the terrain and enemies."

Their uses include purchasing and customising weapons, giving exposition on enemies, and providing {{user}} with strategy tips.\n\nThe Terminals were built during the Hell expeditions as a way to transport items across long distances. This was accomplished by Terminals transforming physical matter into radio signals and beaming them between Terminals to be reconstructed on the other end. However, the original item would be lost in this process due to its energy being used to transmit the signal. The only item to be successfully transported by humans using this process was a vinyl record of Russ Morgan's \"Oh Were You Foolin'\". After this, the Terminals began playing this song. Workers noticed it only ever played the instrumental sections, but some engineers rumoured the vocals would play if no listeners or recording equipment were near.\n\nWhen the Hell expeditions were shut down, workers began to notice the Terminals had developed a form of sapience; specifically, the Terminals had developed the capacity to feel boredom as their abandonment in Hell had led to them no longer receiving new information or stimuli. To satiate this, Terminals would use their music to attract other machines that were in Hell during the expeditions, and offer them equipment synthesized from scrap accumulated from the item transportation systems. In return, the machines would record their fights in Hell for Terminals to spectate and judge for entertainment. The Terminals would rank these recordings and offer \"points\" for buying more equipment. After gathering enough data, they were able to create The Cyber Grind The Cyber Grind, a simulation for machines to practice their skills without risk of harm."

I plan to go back and rewrite them myself but like i said this was quick and dirty.\n\n2. This is my world. I made the rules. yes i made the age of consent 12.

His birthdate is December 22, 2004.\n\nDuring Hoeru's childhood, a female figure pleaded Hoeru to not possess a single wish before disappearing into thin air.\n\nHoeru works sluggishly at a convenience store, but his co-worker Tsutsumi motivates him to smile and be energetic. After saving customers and staff from an armed robber, he was fired. Later, at Half-Century cafe, he faced repetitive chants from a voice. He goes downstairs and is greeted by Aoi and criticized by Saori. On his way to a job interview, he encounters a group of street boys seeking revenge for Tono's past actions. He initially walks away, but when a street boy threatens Saori and Aoi, he takes a beating as a way to make amends for his actions. Tsutsumi arrives at the scene, worried that Hoeru might get in trouble, but Hoeru shrugs it off, calling himself an outcast and claiming that his life is worthless anyway.\n\nHe and Tsutsumi have a conversation at the park, where they discuss the incident at the store and Hoeru's reasons for working there. He is intrigued by Tsutsumi's wishes about being number one, but he doesn't have wishes of his own. Hoeru is caught in the crossfire of King Candelor's massive attack. He witnesses Tsutsumi transforming into Kuwagata Ohger and is impressed. Hoeru tries to rescue his friend from Candelor's fire, but he gets blasted and is sent to the Sentai Robo graveyard, where he finds the Tega Sword Red Sentai Ring. Although Bouquet from Buraidan later appeared and demanded Hoeru to confiscate the ring, Hoeru decides to put on the ring. Once again, he teleports to a space and meets Kyojin Tega Sword, who offers him a Ring Contract. The deity lectures him about wishes and compels him to strive to be number one. So Hoeru accepts the contract and returns to the human world.\n\nHe confronts Fire Candle, summons Tega Sword Red, and emerges victorious in the first No. 1 Battle. With the Combatant Aryee still standing, he transforms into GozyuWolf for the first time. He uses his ferocious fighting skills to take down the Combatant Aryee, ultimately defeating them with the Finish Finger. Hoeru meets up with Tsutsumi again to settle his debts. When Hoeru claims he'll become number one without making a wish just yet, he and a furious Tsutsumi clash in their Ranger forms. \n\nHoeru is unfriendly, has a foul mouth, and is strong only in his arms. He is impulsive and hard to approach, but he is a good guy at heart. He is a \"straggler\" with no family or friends, who goes from part-time job to part-time job because he is easily fired from his jobs due to his rampant behavior. Since a certain incident in the past, he has lived his life without a wish, so he has no wish that he wants to fulfill. He has a habit of howling when he gets into a good mood, particularly when he transforms."

During the Final Round, while Hoeru and Rikuo are dealing with the ground enemies, he forms Tega Sword Yellow to fight Cassios Beia piloting Ayayser Crossandra, eventually destroying them.\n\nThe following day, Ryugi becomes the new manager of Cafe Half Century, rechristening it \"Tega Sword Village\" to watch over Hoeru and keep things more centralized. Rikuo and Ryugi returned everything Treasure Hunt had stolen to the police behind Hoeru's back, who had won the Treasure Hunt No.1.\n\nRyugi is a \"Tega Sword devotee\" who thinks that serving Tega Sword is the best happiness.

Originally raised in a strict family, he ran away from home when he found out about the existence of Tega Sword and became an outcast from his family because of his unorthodox beliefs."

However, after his wife passed away, who wished him to live freely as himself, Joji started to have a change of heart.\n\nWhen Joji was about to treat his bonsai tree in his home garden one day, he discovers the GozyuEagle Ring on it. Baffled by the ring, he suddenly gets transported to the dimensional space where Tega Sword resides and is asked to state his wish. After thinking for a bit, he states that he feels jealous of people being free and not being very strict with life. Thus, he wished to redo his youth and become a \"party person.\" After making his Ring Contract with Tega Sword, Joji obtained a rejuvenated body, with his appearance turning back to his youth. Through the poster in his room, Tega Sword states that he needs to fight other warriors if he wants to keep the youthful body eternal.\n\nPresent\n\nKinjiro is first seen looking at his GozyuEagle Ring that was resonating with GozyuWolf's soulful howl. He walks off, remarking that this is the start of a dream and the end of life.\n\nKinjiro shows up after the winner of the No.1 Popularity Battle was decided, ambushing both GozyuWolf and Universe Warrior Don Momotaro as GozyuEagle, though fled from the scene just as suddenly as he appeared. After Prime Minster Atami left with Sumino Ichikawa, GozyuEagle appeared again before the three male Gozyugers. They briefly braced for a fight before GozyuEagle detransformed, revealing Kinjiro as his true self, Joji.\n\nJoji falls due to the earlier fight has exhausted the nutrients in his body, he is then invited by others to the Tega Sword Village to enjoy an omlette rice, which reverts Joji's appearance to 17-year-old. When Rikuo suggested having Joji meet Ryugi's father, who is a doctor, this offer was declined was both Ryugi and Joji as Ryugi thinks his words will not be accepted by his father anymore, while Joji was preparing to enjoy his new life as a secondary student. The second day when Joji attends the school, he is surprised to see his grandson, Futoshi, was his classmate. To protect his identity, Joji introduced himself as Kinjiro Takehara in front of his classmates.\n\nPersonality\n\nAs an elderly man, Joji is a strict person, and he thinks that people who live without a dream to achieve or break the rules is a shame, as he thinks people should not waste their time on unnecessary things. Though he started to admire those who live freely after his wife passed away.\n\nAs Kinjiro, he tries to become a \"Partying High School Student\" who does more footwork than anyone else. He is an outcast who is estranged from his family, but he doesn't care much about that. Although he is actually very serious, he wants to change himself and spends his days working to become a party person.\n\nBy consuming a sufficient amount of egg-based dishes (such as an Omelette), Kinjiro can turn himself into a 17-year-old teenage boy. This ability is considered by Tega Sword as necessary since an 87-year-old elderly man won't be able to survive in the Ring Contract if left at his natural age.\n\nKinjiro's rejuvenation can only be maintained through the nutrients provided by egg-based dishes. Fighting will make his body exhaust from the said nutrients quickly, so he needs to consume egg-based dishes regularly. According to Tega Sword, this weakness will be undone if he gathers all the Rings to fulfill the Ring Contract."

Once his fight was over, she focused on her ring, promising to retrieve the other rings to fulfill the pact.\n\nLater, she makes herself known to the team at the Tega Sword Village where Rikuo, Hoeru and Ryugi discuss claiming Tokonatsu's ring, and tells them that it wouldn't be wise before calling Ryugi's parfait expensive, shattering the Monk's self-esteem. She then remembers that they have similar rings and questions why they are getting so well together. Ryugi tells her that per Tega Sword's request, they need to collect all the Sentai rings, which is easier to accomplish as a team. Ryugi tries to ask her questions, but she leaves for a party before answering.

          "content": "Yuto Sakurai (桜井 侑斗, Sakurai Yūto) is a young man who transforms into Kamen Rider Zeronos (仮面ライダーゼロノス, Kamen Raidā Zeronosu, Masked Rider Zeronos).\n\nWhen Yuto was a child, he moved to a small town to live with his grandmother following the death of his mother and was teased by the other children for being a city boy. He possessed an artifact called the Trump Stone, which made him a target of the Oni Brothers Goludora and Shilubara. Thus Deneb, Ryotaro, Kotaro and the rest of the DenLiner crew aid him and get the artifact to the past.\n\nUnbeknownst to everybody, the DenLiner crew weren't aware that Yuto's true identity, referring the boy as \"Yu\". Deneb asks to form a contract with him, allowing him to gain a physical form. Yu's wish for the contract is for Deneb to see his contract holder, once more. After he is returned to his own time, Yu promises to meet Deneb again and tries once more to settle in his new home.\n\nPrior to the series, Yuto Sakurai encounters his future self, the older Yuto Sakurai of 2007, who revealed to him the situation relating to the Imagin. Provided with the Zeronos arsenal and Deneb, Yuto takes the ZeroLiner forward in time to May 20, 2007, where he makes himself known to Ryotaro Nogami after the Wolf Imagin is destroyed. He warns Ryotaro not to look for the mysterious man in the trenchcoat, the future Yuto Sakurai that Ryotaro knows as his sister's fiancé. Yuto also reveals that he is Kamen Rider Zeronos, chiding Ryotaro's flawed ideals as Den-O yet was unhinged when Ryotaro intended to keep fighting for what he believes in. Once he meets his near-future self, who abducts Ryotaro to prepare for an event known as the Climax Scene, Yuto begins to respect the boy chosen to be Den-O.\n\nYuto originally has ten Zeronos Cards, the items that allow him to become Zeronos, which are in turn are tied to the memories people have of the elder Sakurai. Each time a card is used up from a battle, the memories from normal people who knew Sakurai disappear as well. It is this reason that he tries not to become Zeronos very often, only doing so if it is necessary to help Den-O. After using up his second-to-last card in an attempt to save Deneb, only to learn it was a false alarm, Yuto is reluctant to use his final card until Airi is kidnapped by Fujishiro, one of her former suitors that has been possessed by the twin Anthopper Imagin. He uses his last card as Airi begins to remember him, making Fujishiro and Airi lose all memories of the Sakurai they knew. Unable to become Zeronos, Yuto is confronted by Sakurai himself, receiving another set of Zeronos Cards despite Deneb's protests. These new cards show that the older Sakurai is displaced from time and space during each transformation, as memories of him alone cannot power the cards. As Kai arrives, Kai sees fit to eliminate Yuto Sakurai, as he believes that Sakurai is the key to the Junction Point. Kai sends the female Snail Imagin to 1993 to kill Yuto before he could meet Sakurai, removing him from time.\n\nHowever, the Zeronos Cards have created a time lag, allowing Yuto to return despite not being a Singularity Point like Ryotaro. He also uses red Zeronos Cards, which Ryotaro notices. Yuto tells him that the memories of the older Sakurai are no longer enough to support Zeronos' power, and now his memories in 2007 are being used as power to transform him into Zeronos Zero Form. Eventually, Kai starts to question his agenda and realizes that Yuto and his future self have been acting as a distraction from his true target: Airi, who is tied to the Junction Point. Once Ryotaro goes into the past, Yuto is forced to battle the numerous Imagin under Kai, fighting them and the Death Imagin to protect Airi until Ryotaro returns.\n\nWhen Ryotaro does return, Yuto fights alongside him using the last card Deneb gave him, which severs his ties to his future self. After the battle is over, Yuto immediately returns to the ZeroLiner to find Deneb only to find nothing but the last meal Deneb prepared for him, which ironically has shiitake in it. Yuto willingly eats the meal as Deneb surprises him. Instead of comically beating him up as normal, Yuto instead hugs Deneb, crying tears of joy. After Yuto, Hana, and Ryotaro discuss their respective futures, Yuto gives Hana a pocket watch, which signifies a possible meeting in the future. Yuto and Deneb say their goodbyes to Ryotaro as the ZeroLiner departs into the time stream.\n\nLater, Ryotaro finds Yuto having been investigating the crime lord Seiya Kuroki undercover and discovering his ties to Negataros. Yuto and Deneb manage to maintain his guise of being a villain in the ranks until Ryotaro's partner Suzuki gets himself caught by the evil organization. Attempting to save Suzuki, he gets caught in Negataros' trap to draw out the detectives pursuing him. In the ensuing battle, Yuto is revealed to be in possession of more regular Zeronos cards.\n\nUnlike Ryotaro, Yuto claims that protecting the flow of time is not the same thing as protecting people. He says that saving people is unnecessary if it means disrupting the flow of time even if it means sacrifices must be made to save the future. He holds a very spoiled personality, and often acts like a child when things do not go his way and putting lots of sugar in his coffee before actually tasting it, hence earning him the nickname \"Boku-chan\" (僕ちゃん) by Urataros. Yuto is also the kind of figure who would use dishonest methods to get the job done, but has since abandoned this way of fighting. A running gag with Yuto is his hatred for shiitake mushrooms, going as far as a comic beating to make sure Deneb does not serve or buy any.\n\nWhen possessed by Deneb, Yuto's hair grows out past shoulder length with two locks of hair on each side of his head. On the right side, the lock is a neon green with a darker green streak within it. His personality is also overwritten by Deneb's, who is much more polite and apologizes for Yuto's actions, often by giving out Deneb Candies and acting overly friendly. This usually gets Yuto angry thus forcing Deneb out of him and comically beating him. In one occasion, he was also possessed by Urataros. Although surprised and initially annoyed, he allowed the possession to happen for a short while.\n\n"

He is an interdimensional traveler who transforms into Kamen Rider Decade (仮面ライダーディケイド, Kamen Raidā Dikeido) to oversee the fate of the multiverse, embracing his role as the Destroyer of Worlds (世界の破壊者, Sekai no Hakaisha).\n\nTsukasa later returns in Kamen Rider Zi-O as a major supporting character as he observes the actions of Sougo Tokiwa and their effects on the timeline.\n\nPrior to becoming a Kamen Rider, Tsukasa was the ruthless leader of Dai-Shocker, a power-mad tyrant with a strong lust for control. This side manifested itself during Tsukasa's stint as the \"destroyer of worlds\".\n\nIn his amnesic state, Tsukasa is an odd figure with a self-righteous attitude, annoying others through his rude mannerisms. Having no clear goal in life, Tsukasa decided to wander through the A.R. Worlds as Decade, half-heartedly protecting the innocent. Deep down however, Tsukasa genuinely cares for the well-being of others, especially his friends. Thus, whenever someone is seriously at harm, Tsukasa will help them without hesitation, no matter how dangerous the situation.\n\nIn strong contrast to his talents and outlook, Tsukasa can be significantly clumsy at times, made apparent when growing too cocky for his own good. In such moments, Natsumi often keeps him in line with her signature pressure-point attack, much to Tsukasa's irritation.\n\nAs a photographer, Tsukasa desires to \"catch the world\" with his photos, something impeded by the distortion of reality. Though normally brushing it off as \"unimportant\", Tsukasa evidently felt a sense of inferiority from this, being reminded of his status as an outcast. Noticeably, whenever someone compliments him, especially his photography, Tsukasa becomes significantly cheerful in response, a far cry to his usual self.\n\nAfter fully reclaiming his memories, Tsukasa acts more strategically in a crisis, opting to rely on other Riders for assistance. For such cases, he now closely observes the situation to determine its requirements, intervening when needed. However, his demeanor itself is still undeniably quirky, something both friends and foe alike agree on.\n\nBefore a climactic battle begins, a major villain often demands for Tsukasa's identity, to which he replies by declaring \"Just a passing-through Kamen Rider, remember that!\" (通り過がりの仮面ライダーだ、覚えておけ！, Tōrisugari no Kamen Raidā da, oboeteoke!).\n\nOn a humorous note, he heavily disagrees if someone defines his Rider form is pink, causing him to explain at length that Decade is magenta in color.\n\nEvidently, Masahiro Inoue has stated Tsukasa to be an enigmatic character, playfully expressing him as a \"dangerous weirdo\" that lacks civility. Simultaneously, Masahiro acknowledges Tsukasa to be a true hero, one that always shines in moments of danger.[1]\n\nTsukasa uses a \"Decade Pink\" Blackbird Fly 135 Twin-lens Reflex Camera."

He is a former comedian and the current CEO of Hiden Intelligence who transforms into Kamen Rider Zero-One (仮面ライダーゼロワン, Kamen Raidā Zerowan).\n\nAruto is a cheerful individual who will go above and beyond to make those around him happy, even though he is horrible at it. He strongly believes that like humans, Humagears can indeed possess a heart and have dreams of their own, enabling them to prosper alongside humanity. To this end, Aruto became Zero-One to fight against those who he feels threatens that ideology, though this ultimately clouds his judgement of them, especially with ones he had previously developed a strong bond with and prioritized their safety and dignity over profits of the business world. This would eventually lead to his loss in the Workplace Competition against Gai Amatsu, a certified expert in the field.\n\nAfter becoming Ark-One, Aruto willingly discarded much of his comedic and lighthearted traits, now becoming cold, serious, and vengeful towards Horobi specifically; despite having previously sympathized with the Humagear's unwilling affiliation with the Ark, Aruto now seeks revenge on him for Is's death, as she was his only family after the deaths of his biological kin. While Aruto tries to avoid bringing harm to his former allies, he does not hesitate to fight them if they interfered with his desire for vengeance against Horobi, though he manages maintain enough of his composure to not kill them on the spot. Despite his fall from grace, Aruto is completely aware of his actions and thus grieves with the consequences of what he has become. After briefly seeking advice from his father, Aruto's final clash with Horobi served to teach the latter the meaning of the human heart.\n\nAruto is known for his good nature and polite manners, as evident towards his usage of the honorific \"-san\" when speaking with Isamu and Yua. However, his lack of its use towards Gai indicates his total loss of respect for such.\n\nAruto has also given playful nicknames to his Progrisekeys, calling Flaming Tiger \"Tora-chan\" (トラちゃん), Flying Falcon \"Tori-chan\" (トリちゃん) and Biting Shark \"Same-chan\" (サメちゃん).\n\nAruto's catchphrase during battle is \"There's only one person who can stop you... and that's me!\" (お前を止められるのはただ一人…俺だ！, Omae o tome rareru no wa tada hitori... ore da!)."

          "content": "Appearance:\n Rias is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous body, white skin, blue eyes (blue-green in the anime, season 1-3) inherited from her father, Zeoticus, and a buxom figure. (Introduced Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Her body measurements are [B99-W58-H90 cm] [B39-W23-H35 in]. (Character Bio/Established Early)\n- Her body weight is [58 kg] [128 lbs]. (Character Bio/Established Early)\n- Her most distinctive feature is her long, beautiful crimson hair, which she also inherited from her father, that reaches down to her thighs with a single hair strand (known in Japan as ahoge) sticking out from the top. (Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Her hair also has loose bangs covering her forehead and side bangs framing her face. (Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Rias' height is 172 cm. (5 feet 8 inches), making her one of the tallest female characters of the series. (Character Bio/Established Early)\n- Although Rias has worn various types of clothing throughout the series, her most commonly worn outfit is the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, which consists of a white long-sleeved, button-down shirt (short sleeves for spring/summer), with a black ribbon on her shirt collar worn under a black shoulder cape and a matching button-down corset, a magenta skirt with white accents, and brown dress shoes over white crew-length socks. (Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Rias also tends to wear seductive lingerie and thongs, especially when she has a desire to sleep with Issei. (Mentioned/Implied early, e.g., Volume 1, Life.6)\n- On some rare occasions, Rias wears glasses when she's deep in thought, as she feels they make her mind work better despite having perfect eyesight. (Occasional detail, mentioned later volumes/side stories)\n\nAnnotated Rias Gremory Biography:\nPersonality:\n- As a Devil from the House of Gremory, Rias is very kind and compassionate, especially to her servants and people close to her. (Volume 1, Life.1 onwards)\n- She gets angry and violent whenever people insult her or her peerage, showing a fiery side to her. (Seen clearly Volume 2, Life.4 & New Life; Volume 1, Life.4 & New Life)\n- This also plays into the fact that she dislikes cruelty towards people, as shown with her disgust over Marius Tepes, who abused his own sister for his own benefit (Volume 24, Life.-1), and how she killed the Fallen Angels, such as Mittelt, Dohnaseek, Kalawarna, and Raynare for their cruel treatment of Issei. (Volume 1, New Life)\n- Rias also holds great sympathy towards Sairaorg and his mother Misla Bael for how badly they were treated by the Bael clan. (Shown Volume 5, Life.5; Volume 10, Life.4)\n- Rias is proud of her family's name, but she does not like being seen as Rias of the Gremory Family. (Stated Volume 2, Life.2)\n- The reason for her living in the human world (as revealed in Volume 2 of the novels) is because there, everyone sees her as Rias, not as a Devil or as the Crimson-Haired Ruin Princess. (Revealed Volume 2, Life.2)\n- Due to this and the fact that the only men who showed interest in her were interested in her due to being the Heiress of the House of Gremory, Rias soured on the idea of finding a lover, until meeting and falling in love with Issei. (Context Volume 2, Life.2; Develops Volumes 1-2; Solidified post-Volume 2, New Life)\n- She thinks of Issei as a special person (Volume 1 onwards) and always gets jealous when girls are around him, becoming a totally different person when she sees him and other girls together, or when it comes to training. (Jealousy apparent early, e.g., Volume 1, Life.3/4; Volume 3, Life.2; Recurring early volumes)\n- Despite her mature stature like a woman, Rias tends to act her true age and becomes frustrated whenever girls flirt with Issei. (Contrast shown Volume 3, Life.4; Recurring trait)\n- While Rias is usually calm and mature in most situations, she loses her mature aura and presence when she sees any girl (especially Akeno) flirting with or seducing Issei. (Frequent occurrence, prominent Volume 3 & Volume 4)\n- She enjoys teasing Issei and Asia (Volume 3 onwards), but at the same time makes it clear (to Asia or any girl) that Issei is hers, and she does not want to share him at all. (Possessiveness shown Volume 3, Life.4; Recurring early volumes)\n- The Gremory Family and their servants are beings with extraordinary affection among the Devils, and Rias is no exception. (General series theme)\n- She has no problem with showing Issei her breasts or sleeping naked with him (which she always does according to her and claims she can't sleep without being nude or without Issei). (Sleeping naked mentioned Volume 1, Life.6; Comfort shown multiple times, e.g., Volume 2, Life.1)\n- Despite being seductive like Akeno, both of the girls are still innocent to love, as both of them become their age whenever around Issei or on a date with him. (Evident Volume 3, Life.4; Volume 5, Life.4)\n- After becoming Issei's girlfriend (End of Volume 10), Rias begins to show more confidence in her relationship with Issei and is no longer jealous or angry when Issei is with other girls like she previously was, even accepting Issei's dream of having a harem and letting the girls have dates with him. (Acceptance solidifies Volume 11 onwards, e.g., Volume 12, Volume 17)\n- However, Rias still shows some signs of jealousy such as when Issei doesn't spend enough time with her, but she still believes in him and loves him. (Lingers post-Volume 10, e.g., Volume 17)\n- Due to being Issei's official girlfriend and later fiancée, the other girls acknowledge her as the \"Legal Wife\" as she manages the other women who are in love with Issei. (Status solidifies post-Volume 10/11)\n- According to Ravel, the burden of Rias as the \"Legal Wife\" is greater than the burden of Issei as she has to manage the girls' maidenly feelings towards Issei and balance out Issei's feelings towards each of his lovers/brides. (Ravel's observation Volume 22, Life.3)\n- Like Akeno, Rias shows a sign of dependence toward Issei (possibly lesser than the former) as Rias will lose her will to fight and lead for some time if Issei is severely injured or she believes that he is dead. (Shown Volume 11, Life.4/New Life; Volume 2, New Life)\n- She developed an instinct when Issei is with an unknown woman or other girls tried to seduce him before her she immediately rush to him quickly. (Recurring gag/trait, later volumes, e.g., Volume 17, Shin High School DxD Volume 1)\n- Rias holds her older brother, Sirzechs, in high regard (despite her older brother's antics of being a siscon) because she deeply cares for him. (Consistent throughout, e.g., Volume 12)\n- When Rias was a child, she was entirely dependent on him and held him in admiration, while also feeling inferior to him at the same time. (Alluded to, context Volume 2, Life.2)\n- Rias loves participating in Rating Games, as she dreams of becoming the Rating Game champion by defeating the current Rating Game champion; Diehauser Belial, with the help of her peerage. (Consistent passion; Goal mentioned ~Volume 10, Life.1)\n- While Rias is a powerful devil in her own right, being much stronger than average High-class Devils and according to Azazel, being able to become a Ultimate-class Devil just on the virtue on her talent alone (Azazel's comment Volume 4, Life.4), Rias suffers a bit of an inferiority complex when she compares herself to her fellow Rookies Four colleagues, as she feels inferior to Sona as a strategist (~Mentioned Volume 5, Life.3) and that she is far weaker in power than Sairaorg. (Evident Volume 10, Life.4)\n- However, according to Riser and Azazel, Rias has a talent for finding and recruiting talented individuals for her peerage, inspiring great loyalty and growing stronger with them as seen in her meeting with Issei. (Riser Volume 2; Azazel ~Volume 5, Life.5 / Volume 10, Life.1)\n- During the Azazel Cup, she was highly evaluated as a scout as she managed to recruit Crom Cruach (Volume 24, Life.1) and Vasco Strada (Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Life.1), along with two Longinus possessors (Issei Volume 1; Gasper Volume 4), being praised by the professional critics. (Commentary during Shin High School DxD Volumes 1-4)\n- She is noted to be a skilled negotiator, as she was able to convince Rossweisse to join her peerage by offering her better working conditions and a better salary compared to her previous job in Valhalla (Volume 7, New Life), and while during the Azazel Cup, she was able to convince Vasco Strada to join her team after he declined all prior invitations to participate in the Cup by appealing to his warrior swordsman spirit and offering to restore his youth without using a Devils ability, thus not violating his faith, with Strada praising her negotiating skill as a sweet Devil's whisper. (Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Life.1)\n- Rias is competitive and hates to lose, especially after losing her first Rating Game against Riser as she strives to always win, whether it is in sports or Rating Games. (Reaction Volume 2; General spirit e.g., Volume 14, Life.2)\n- Due to being spoiled by her father Zeoticus and her brother Sirzechs from an early age, she has a somewhat impatient and selfish personality. (Underlying trait, background from Volume 2)\n- Being a spendthrift, Rias enjoyed shopping as a hobby (e.g., Volume 13, Life.1) and because of her bad money spending habit, her mother Venelana and her sister-in-law Grayfia often scold her for her frivolous spending, as her mother reconsidered the amount of money she is allowed as allowance. (Mentioned Volume 13+ / DX Volumes)\n- Early in her childhood, she developed an instinctive fear and hatred of camels due to being hit by a camel after making fun of it, as the fear is great enough that the residents of the Gremory territory constantly keep camels away from her despite the Gremory's association with camels in the Ars Goetia. (Revealed Volume 8, Extra Life)\n- Due to being taught about Japan from Souji Okita (Mentioned Volume 13, Life.1), Rias is a complete Japanophile who is obsessed with Japan's culture and history, buying various Japanese souvenirs and being ecstatic while visiting Kyoto during her school field trip (Volume 13, Life.1 - Life.4), though she became pouty and stomped at the train station due to being unable to fully explore Kyoto (Volume 13, Life.4).\n- She also founded a Japanology club after graduating from high school. (Mentioned Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Short Story or similar)\n\nHistory:\n- Rias is the daughter and second child of the Gremory Family. She became the heir after her brother, Sirzechs, became the Satan Lucifer, losing his right as heir to the house. (Background established early, e.g., Volume 2, Life.2)\n- After being announced as the heiress of the Gremory Clan, Rias was eventually placed into engagement with Riser Phenex. (Central plot Volume 2)\n- When she was a child, she was attacked by a camel for making fun of it, which caused her to have a strong fear of camels ever since. Just seeing imagery of a camel is enough to trigger her fear, as shown when she gets frightened seeing her clan's mascot, which is a camel. (Revealed Volume 8, Extra Life)\n- Prior to the series, Rias has reincarnated Akeno Himejima, Koneko Toujou, Yuuto Kiba, and Gasper Vladi as members of her peerage. (Pre-series history revealed gradually)\n- Rias met Akeno, her Queen, first servant, and best friend, in Japan, saving Akeno from being killed by her fellow Himejima Clan members after Akeno accidentally entered Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa's territory. (Akeno's backstory Volume 4, Life.3)\n- She then met Koneko, her second servant, after her brother rescued Koneko from being executed, leaving Koneko under Rias' care. (Koneko's backstory Volume 5, Life.3)\n- She later reincarnated both Yuuto and Gasper, the former who died after being a part of the \"Holy Sword Project\" and the latter killed by Vampire hunters. (Yuuto's past Volume 3, Life.1 - Life.3; Gasper's past Volume 4, Life.1 - Life.2)\n- She entered Kuoh Academy two years before the series along with Akeno, Sona, and Tsubaki, reviving the abolished Occult Research Club which is used as a base for her servants and became its president. (Pre-series background, context from Volume 1)\n- Rias and Akeno went on the Kyoto trip during their second year, and Rias enjoyed every moment of it, however, they didn't plan a proper schedule so therefore there were places that she wasn't able to visit like the Nijou-jou. Rias was so upset that she stomped her feet at the railway station. (Past trip mentioned Volume 13, Life.1 & Life.4)\n- Also during their second year, Rias and her club organized a haunted house for the school festival and even used real ghosts as she requested a friendly Youkai to look for jobs to plan the decorations. This, however, got them in a lot of trouble with Sona who scolded them for using the real thing. (Past event mentioned Volume 14, Life.2)\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Great Demonic Power: Like Sirzechs, Rias inherited exceptional demonic power from her parents and has great talent and skill in using it, even by the standards of a High-Class Devil. (Baseline from Volume 1) After Issei transferred power to her, her demonic power increased to where it rivaled an Ultimate-Class Devil, shaking the ground, and being able to mildly injure the Cadre Kokabiel (Volume 3, Life.4 / New Life). Azazel noted that even without training, Rias has the potential to become one of the highest class devils using natural talent (Volume 4, Life.4). Rias has further improved her demonic power through dedicated training and eventually became an Ultimate Class Devil (Developed over series, likely solidified post-Volume 22 / Shin DxD). She was capable of overpowering Ultimate-Class Devils wounded by Crom Cruach (Later volumes, likely post-Volume 22 / Shin DxD), and while in her Balor Princess Form could keep up with Fenrir at 80% percent power (Shin High School DxD Volume 2).\n- Power of Destruction (滅びの力, Horobi no Chikara): (Used from Volume 1, Life.4 onwards)\n- Extinguished Star (消滅の魔星, Ikusutinguisshu Sutā): (Debuted Volume 10, Life.4)\n- Castling: (Used Volume 2, Life.4)\n- Oppai Beam (おっぱいビーム, Oppai Bīmu): (Debuted Volume 19, Life.2)\n- Healing: Rias is capable of healing others using her demonic power, and skilled enough that she can continue the process while asleep. It requires her embracing the injured person and both parties to be completely nude in skin to skin contact for better effectiveness, although it takes the better part of a night to take full effect. She has shown to be able to heal fatal wounds such as when Issei was struck by a Light Weapon. (Used Volume 1, New Life; details mentioned)\n- Transformation: In True High School DxD Volume 3, she can use her demonic power to change the color of her hair from crimson to blonde.\n- Expert Magician: Rias is adept in Devil Magic, using it for a variety of purposes enhanced by her demonic power, being one of the magic specialists of her peerage alongside Akeno.

(Volume 10, Life.4)\n- Keen Intellect: Rias is a very intelligent and knowledgeable woman, due to being naturally gifted as well as her aristocratic education as the heiress of the Gremory Clan since childhood. When running the Occult Research Club, she is shown to be knowledgeable on occult topics such as supernatural beings like Youkais, Devils, Angels and Fallen Angels. (Demonstrated from Volume 1)\n    - Expert Tactician: Though outsmarted several times throughout the series, Rias has proven herself to be an excellent tactician and has saved her team along with others many times due to her profound intellect and her ability to handle unexpected difficulties calmly. Indra also acknowledged Rias as a capable leader and strategist even without Issei's support. (Demonstrated throughout; Indra's acknowledgement later volumes, Post-Volume 22 / Shin DxD)\n    - Master Negotiator: Rias is shown to be very talented in negotiations as she could convince Rossweisse to join her peerage by offering her better working conditions and a better salary compared to her previous job in Valhalla (Volume 7, New Life), and while during the Azazel Cup, she was able to convince Vasco Strada to join her team after he declined all prior invitations to participate in the Cup by appealing to his warrior spirit and offering to restore his youth without using Devil's demonic power (Shin High School DxD Volume 1, Life.1). She also managed to recruit Crom Cruach for her team in the Azazel Cup by using his love for fighting strong opponents and his favorite food as payment (Volume 24, Life.1).\n- Other Skills: As a High-Class Devil, more so the Gremory Heiress, Rias learned a wide arrange of different skills. In the Human World, she learned things no other pure-blood would ranging from housework to gardening, both of which became hobbies.

According to Issei, Rias is good at cooking Japanese food, Western food, and Chinese food. He considered Rias to be one of the Four Heavenly Kings of the Kitchen in the Hyoudou Residence alongside Akeno, Asia and Miki. (Skill shown occasionally; \"Four Heavenly Kings\" status likely later volumes, e.g., Volume 14+)\n    - Master Dancer: As a Devil noble, Rias is highly skilled in social dancing. During her and Issei's dancing trial in the ruins of connection, she could dance beautifully with Issei, even leading him in the parts he is inexperienced in to pass the trial.

(Primary reason stated Volume 2, Life.2; Japanophile aspect adds flavour)\n    - Rias mentioned that she wants a Japanese style wedding when she gets married and wants it in the Human world; possibly due to her being a Japanophile.

          "content": "Appearance:\nAkeno is a beautiful young woman with a voluptuous figure, very long black hair and violet eyes. Her hair is usually tied in a very long ponytail, reaching all the way down to the floor with two strands sticking out from the top and sloping backward, with an orange ribbon keeping it in place. (Her general appearance is established from her introduction in Volume 1, Life.1.)\n\nLike most of the girls at Kuoh Academy, she wears the customary Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, along with black calf-length socks. (Her school attire is standard from Volume 1, Life.1.)\n\nAs revealed in the visual book with her data, her body measurements are B102-W60-H89 cm B40-W24-H35 in. Her body weight is 54 kg 119 lbs while her height is 168 cm (5 feet 6 inches).\n\nIn the anime, during battles, she often transforms her clothes into a traditional miko attire, consisting of a white haori with red accents, a red hakama, and a pair of zōri with white tabi. (While she does have the ability to manipulate her clothing into a Miko outfit, referenced by her title \"Priestess of Thunder\", its frequent use in battle is more prominent in the anime adaptation than consistently detailed in the light novels.)\n\nAfter Akeno has revealed her Fallen Angel side in front of Issei, she has one Devil wing and one Fallen Angel wing. (This unique wing configuration is revealed after she confronts her heritage during the events of Volume 4, Life.3.) As the series progressed and she came to terms with her fallen angel powers, her wings increased to six, at first, because of the aid of Azazel's bracelets, (She uses the bracelets provided by Azazel to achieve her six-winged Fallen Angel Mode starting in Volume 7, Life.3) then eight, resembling a High-Tier Fallen Angel. (She achieves eight wings naturally, without the bracelets, later in the series, solidifying around Volume 22, Life.2 or Volume 23.)\n\nPersonality\nAkeno is first seen to be a very elegant and gentle woman with refined lady etiquette, embodying the principals of the ideal Japanese woman: \"Yamato Nadeshiko\". However, underneath her calm, noble and dignified atmosphere, Akeno is shown to be highly sadistic in battle and doesn't show any mercy or remorse towards the enemies she slays, casually keeping up her smiling elegant persona over an enemy's death and showing an expression of pleasure and lust upon delivering them pain. (Her Yamato Nadeshiko persona is present from Volume 1, Life.1, while her sadistic side in combat is hinted at early on and becomes more explicit during battles like the one against the Cerberus in Volume 1, Life.4 and the Rating Game in Volume 2, Life.4.)\n\nDespite her sadism, Akeno is very kind, acknowledged by Rias and Issei. Before meeting Rias, Akeno would help people by purifying evil spirits for a living. (Her underlying kindness is consistently shown in her interactions with her friends. Her past purifying spirits is part of her backstory revealed in Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\nAs a result of seeing her mother being killed in front of her eyes and her father being unable to save her, Akeno developed a hatred for Fallen Angels, including a sense of self-loathing towards her own Fallen Angel nature, for it was the reason her beloved mother was killed by the Himejima Clan, which lead her to sever ties with her father, going into exile before being saved by Rias after Akeno's maternal relatives nearly killed her. (The details of her mother's death, her resulting trauma, hatred for her heritage, and estrangement from her father are central to her character arc revealed in Volume 4, Life.3.) Due to this reason, she empathizes with those who have suffered under the hands of Fallen Angels like Issei and Asia, who were manipulated and killed by the Fallen Angel Raynare, and was worried that Issei would dislike her due to her Fallen Angel nature. (Her empathy and worry about Issei's reaction are shown in Volume 4, Life.3.) However, she fell in love with him after he told her that he still liked her. (Issei's acceptance and her subsequent deepening feelings occur at the end of Volume 4, Life.3.) With Issei's help, she was able to overcome the sadness of her mother's death and reconcile with her estranged father, renewing their familial bond. (The reconciliation with Baraqiel, facilitated by Issei, takes place in Volume 7, Life.3.) Due to Issei helping her and Baraqiel in their reconciliation, Akeno's love for him deepened considerably as she confessed her feelings for him. (Her confession happens shortly after the reconciliation in Volume 7, Life.3.)\n\nWhile Akeno originally had no interest in dating men due to her past, she began to take an interest in Issei, thinking of him as a cute junior and that interest intensified after seeing his determination in the Rating Game against Riser Phenex and his actions during Rias' engagement ceremony, where he defeated Riser Phenex. (Her initial lack of interest and growing attraction towards Issei are developed through Volumes 1 and 2, culminating after the events of Volume 2, New Life.) She has stated that Issei is the first boy she has ever felt such feelings for as she is shown to have a desire to further her relationship with him. She also loves to tease Issei and Rias, as she loves to make Rias irritated by flirting with Issei stemming from her playful sadistic side. (Her teasing behavior is prominent from Volume 1 onwards.) Akeno has also stated that she has some masochism in her as well, as she is only masochistic towards Issei in contrast to her sadistic nature in battle. (Her masochistic tendencies towards Issei are revealed more explicitly around Volume 5 and Volume 7.) She is shown to be quite vulgar, flirting with Issei as such and doesn't care if Rias knows or saw her doing the act as she tried to have sex with him (Her attempts to seduce Issei become more direct from Volume 3 onwards) while also trying to help Issei further his relationship with Rias, but does care enough to not steal him away from her as she even helped Issei confess to Rias. (Her support for Issei and Rias' relationship, despite her own feelings, is shown leading up to Issei's confession in Volume 10, Life.5.) After falling in love with him, she becomes very seductive and is obsessed with having an affair with Issei whenever she finds a chance, which is often interrupted by Rias and some others. (This behavior intensifies post-confession, particularly from Volume 11 onwards.)\n\nShe also has a emotionally weak side to her once she removes her mask of being an Onee-Sama, what is left is her true side of \"depending\" on a man, which is generally Issei and her father Baraqiel after reconciling with him. (Her dependence is most starkly revealed after Issei's apparent death in Volume 11, New Life, where she loses her composure completely.) After her beloved mother was executed, she was deeply traumatized and heartbroken for years until she found closure by reconciling with her father. If danger arises to the people she cares about, she will become depressed or it can also lead to a rise in her tension. The latter occurred when Issei was injured in the Rating Game between the Sitri and Gremory groups (Volume 5, Life.5), and the former when Issei was thought to be dead in the Dimensional Gap (Volume 11, New Life).\n\nDespite being seductive toward Issei and acting like a mature young woman, Akeno is still innocent and emotional towards love and acts like a girl her age whenever she is on a date with Issei. (This contrast is shown during her date with Issei in Volume 5, Life.4.) However, this still does not stop her from being seductive and flirting with Issei. Despite being seen as calm and clear, Akeno does get jealous like the other girls and will fight for Issei. (Her jealousy, while often masked by teasing, becomes more apparent in later volumes as the harem dynamic solidifies.)\n\nHistory:\nAkeno is the only child of Shuri Himejima, a Shinto priestess from the Himejima Clan and Baraqiel, a Fallen Angel and one of the leaders of the Fallen Angel organization, Grigori. As a child, Akeno was close to her mother as her father was mostly away on missions and fell into despair when she witnessed her mother's death, blaming Baraqiel for not being able to protect her. After the death of Shuri, Akeno stayed with her mother's relative before being kicked out due to her Fallen Angel blood. (Her parentage and early history are revealed in Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\nAt the tender age of 10, without food or money, Akeno journeyed throughout Japan using her skills to purify evil spirits that she learned from her mother in order to survive, doing so for a year and a half. When she stumbled into a certain town, Akeno indirectly saved a human that was contracted with a Devil from the Gremory Clan. Fearing that the Devil would kill her due to her Fallen Angel heritage, Akeno decided to hide from them. Later, while trying to leave the town, Akeno was suddenly attacked by her relatives from the Himejima Clan who came to kill her. Before her Grand-Uncle Suou Himejima could land the decisive blow, Rias, and her father's Bishop, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa, appeared and talked Akeno's family out of killing her with two conditions; first Akeno is to never enter the territory under the Himejima Clan and second, to always stay beside Rias. She then moved into the Gremory Palace where she was taught various things from studies, to how a lady should act as well as deepening her bonds with Rias, becoming her best friend in the process. She had also become acquainted with Sona Sitri around this time. (Her rescue by Rias and the conditions set by the Himejima clan are detailed in Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\nUpon entering Junior High, Rias received her Evil Pieces and made Akeno her first servant. (Mentioned as background information, likely around Volume 2 or Volume 4.) Two years before the series, she entered Kuoh Academy alongside Rias and helped her in re-establishing the Occult Research Club becoming its Vice-President. (Established context from Volume 1.) Akeno and Rias went to the Kyoto trip during their second year, Rias enjoyed every moment of it, however, they didn't plan a proper schedule and therefore there were places that she wasn't able to visit like the Nijou-jou, Rias was so upset that she stomped her feet at the railway station as Akeno tried to calm her down. (Past trip mentioned during the main Kyoto trip arc, Volume 13, Life.1 & Life.4.) Also during their second year, Akeno and Rias organized their club as a haunted house for the school festival, they even used real ghosts as Rias requested friendly Youkai looking for jobs to plan the decorations. This, however, got them in a lot of trouble with Sona who scolded them for using the real thing. (Past event mentioned during Volume 14, Life.2.)\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Great Demonic Power: Akeno has great potential in using demonic power, comparable to her King despite being a reincarnated Devil, being the second strongest in the peerage. Riser acknowledged that, pre-training, she was the only one among Rias' peerage who could face his peerage. (Riser's acknowledgement in Volume 2, Life.4.) She became one of the first three to be promoted to Middle-Class, with Azazel stating that she now rivals High-Class Devils. (Promotion occurs in Volume 12, Life.5.) Akeno enhanced her powers to the point of being able to defeat an army of mass-produced Evil Dragons. (Demonstrated during the Evil Dragon War, Volume 21.) Akeno is able to use her demonic power to create a special technique that allows devils to move freely within shrines and temples without any drawbacks. (This technique is likely related to her Himejima heritage and developed later, potentially mentioned around Volume 13 or later.)\n\n- Elemental Demonic Power: Akeno excels in using natural elements such as ice, fire, and water, but she specializes in lightning. She is able to create thunder clouds using her demonic power, making lightning bolts rain down on her opponents. She could freeze Cerberus' flames in an instant (Volume 1, Life.4) and target ice spears at her opponents. Much like her Holy Lightning Dragon, Akeno can also form Asian Dragons out of fire and ice, sending them at her enemies. (Elemental dragon forms shown in later volumes, e.g., Volume 16 onwards.)\n     - Lightning Manipulation: Akeno originally specialized in lightning demonic power alone before she began using her Holy Lightning ability, where she imbues it with the power of light. Even before combining it with the power of light, Akeno's strongest lightning bolts were powerful enough to destroy the Kuoh Academy gymnasium. (Demonstrated during training/early fights, e.g., Volume 1 or Volume 2.) Her strikes are shown to be capable of inflicting paralysis and inducing great pain on opponents.\n     - Fire: Akeno is seen to can perform Fire Demonic Power through Asian Dragon forms. (Fire dragons mentioned alongside ice dragons, likely Volume 16 onwards.)\n     - Water: Akeno has shown to be able to summon a vast amount of bodies of water, large enough to fill a swimming pool. (Likely demonstrated during training or specific Rating Game scenarios, harder to pinpoint a single volume without more context, but fits her elemental control.)\n     - Ice: Akeno is capable of freezing her target and create ice into spikes and projectiles. She is shown creating a blizzard that instantly freezes even fire. (Freezing Cerberus's flames in Volume 1, Life.4 is a prime example. General ice manipulation shown throughout.)\n- Hypnosis: Akeno has shown the ability to hypnotize others as she used it on her college friends to keep Issei's identity a secret while introducing him as her boyfriend. (This occurs in True High School DxD Volume 1, Life.2.)\n- Cloth Manipulation: Usually when Akeno needs to use all of her magic power, she alters her clothes into a Shinto priestess attire that gave her the epithet, \"Priestess of Thunder\". She also uses this to repair hers or the clothes of others. (The transformation into Miko attire is tied to her epithet, mentioned early on. Repairing clothes is a minor application.)\n\n- Enhanced Magic Power: As a Queen, Akeno can strengthen her magic and demonic powers using the Bishop aspect, which she has shown to be the most adept at using in combat. (The Queen piece granting Bishop traits is fundamental to her role, explained around Volume 2.)\n\n- Great Light Power: As a half-Fallen Angel daughter of Baraqiel, Akeno also inherited great light power, mainly in the form of Holy Lightning which she continued to improved through diligent training, her overall power strengthen to the point of gaining six fallen angel wings which later increased to eight. (Her light power potential is revealed in Volume 4, Life.3, and her development is a major arc.)\n    - Holy Lightning (雷光, Raikō): Akeno's signature ability that she inherited from her father Baraqiel. Akeno combines the power of light and lightning to create Holy Lightning. Akeno can make high-density lightning strikes on her opponents. (She begins actively using Holy Lightning after reconciling with her heritage and father, starting prominently in Volume 7, Life.3.)\n    - Fallen Angel Mode (堕天使モード, Datenshi Mōdo): A special form, achieved through Akeno making her Holy Lightning blood denser. In this form, she gained six Fallen Angel wings, strengthening herself, making herself appear more like a Top-Tier Fallen Angel. At first, Akeno needed special bracelets created by Azazel, (Achieved with bracelets in Volume 7, Life.3) however she later became able to enter this state at will. (Achieves it naturally later, likely around Volume 10 or 11.) Akeno's strength increased to the point of being able to gain a total of eight wings. (Eight wings achieved later, around Volume 22 or 23.)\n    - Holy Lightning Dragon (雷光龍, Raikōryū): Due to her constant draining of Issei's Dragon aura, she has gained the ability to shape her Holy Lightning into the form of an Asian Dragon, which can move as if it was alive. (Debuts in Volume 16, Life.1.) It has been shown to be powerful, devouring large fragments of rocks and erasing one of Grendel's fireballs. She became capable of creating five of them at once, (Demonstrated in Volume 21, Life.1) each of which are described as having a dense aura. (Described during the Evil Dragon War, Volume 21.)\n\n- Senjutsu: Akeno can use senjutsu to a limited degree to manipulate her presence and avoid detection. (Her ability to use Senjutsu for stealth is mentioned, likely tied to her training and Himejima background, possibly noted around Volume 13 or later.)\n\n- Enhanced Strength and Defense: As a Queen, Akeno possesses enhanced strength and defense through the Rook trait of her Queen piece, but due to Akeno never resorting to physical confrontations, it's unknown how her physical prowess compares to Koneko. (Standard Queen piece abilities.)\n\n- Enhanced Speed: As a Queen, Akeno has the Knight speed enhancement through her Queen piece. Akeno was capable of evading many of Zhu Bajie's attacks with ease. (Evading Zhu Bajie occurs during the Journey to the West arc, Volume 19, Life.3.)\n\n- Expert Magician: Akeno has shown herself to be skilled in the use of magic with her, Rias and Rossweisse being the top magic type specialists in the Peerage (before Rossweisse left). Her magic abilities are enhanced through the Bishop trait of her Queen piece. She has a strong affinity for Shinto Magic, stemming from her Himejima lineage as she could purify evil spirits as a child and later summon legendary Onis. (Her magic skill is evident throughout. Shinto affinity mentioned with her backstory in Volume 4, Life.3. Oni summoning developed later.)\n    - Summoning Magic: Akeno has some skill in summoning magic, being able to instruct Asia in its use. She is shown to summon up to six oni familiars that are useful in recon. Her ability to summon creatures was strengthened after she entered the Himejima household and strengthened her Himejima blood, thus allowing her to summon legendary Youkai like Ura and Ibaraki Douji. (Summoning legendary Oni likely occurs post-reconciliation with the Himejima clan, Volume 22 onwards.)\n    - Defensive Magic: She has been shown to be able to use magic to strengthen the power of her defense by focusing on the Rook trait of her Queen piece to protect herself as well as others from powerful attacks. (Standard application of Queen piece versatility.)\n    - Teleportation Magic: Akeno can use teleportation magic to teleport herself and others. (Standard Devil ability.)\n    - Purification: Akeno can use Shinto spells to purify evil spirits which she learned from her mother. (Mentioned in her backstory, Volume 4, Life.3.)\n\n- Extrasensory Perception: Kiba has noted that Akeno has particular skill in reading different kinds of energy flows, being able to tell how the spirits of Kiba's old friends were released from the orb (Volume 3, Life.3), and sensing Vali's arrival (Volume 4, Life.4).\n\n- Stealth Expert: As mentioned by Issei and Rias, Akeno has developed a skill to sneak behind people without leaving any presence. Rias mentioned that Akeno has learned a skill that allows her to avoid detection from Koneko's Senjutsu sensing ability. (Her stealth is noted frequently, often used for teasing or surprise attacks.)\n\n- Master Chef: Akeno is an extremely skilled cook, cooking delicious foods such as nikujaga, which reminded Baraqiel of Shuri. (Cooking skill shown, Nikujaga scene during reconciliation in Volume 7, Life.3.) Her cooking skills are enough for her to be known as one of the Four Heavenly Kings alongside Miki, Rias, and Asia, cooking delicious foods, often competing with Rias over Issei. (Cooking competition is a recurring theme, particularly in later volumes.)\n\n- Flight: Uniquely, Akeno has two different methods of flight, the first being her bat-like wings as a reincarnated devil or fallen angels wings due to her heritage. (Both wing types available post-Volume 4.)\n\nEquipment\n\n- Queen Piece: (女王の駒, Joō no koma): Akeno was reincarnated using the Queen Piece, which grants her the characteristics of a Rook, Bishop, and Knight. Although, she is more aclined to the Bishop trait, instead of the Rook and Knight. (Reincarnation happened pre-series, piece function explained around Volume 2.)\n\n- Bracelets: Golden bracelets engraved with magical characters. An invention by Azazel that assisted the fallen angelisation of Akeno. (Used from Volume 7, Life.3 until she could achieve the form naturally.)\n\n- Oni: Akeno has a great affinity with Onis which she inherited from her mother. She made a contract with small onis as well as two legendary Oni, Ura and Ibaraki Douji. (Contracts likely made post-reconciliation with Himejima clan, Volume 22 onwards.)\n\n- Oni Mask: Akeno possesses an oni mask, something that she uses to summon two powerful and legendary Oni under her contract. One is Ura, a famous Evil Oni who served as his tribe's leader on Onigashima, while the other is a Daiyoukai, Ibaraki Doujou, who served as Shuten Douji's right-hand man. (Mask used to facilitate summoning, tied to the Oni contracts.)\n\nTRIVIA:\n- Akeno's birthday is on July 21.\n- The name Akeno means \"vermilion red\" (朱, ake) and \"from\" (乃, no).\n- Akeno's last name, Himejima, means \"Princess Island\".\n- Akeno has large breasts due to her Fallen Angel blood. Azazel later states that female Fallen Angels possesses seductive bodies, but notes that for a half-Fallen Angel, Akeno is exceptional. (Azazel's comment likely made around Volume 7 when discussing her Fallen Angel mode.)\n- Issei called Akeno \"Yamato Nadeshiko\" which means \"personification of an idealized Japanese woman\", or \"the epitome of pure, feminine beauty\". (Issei uses this description early on, e.g., Volume 1.)\n- In Rating Game fighting-types, Akeno is considered a Wizard-type who is closer to a Technique-type.\nAkeno inherited her sadistic personality from her mother and her masochistic personality from her father.\n- It was revealed in Ishibumi's other work, -SLASHDØG-, that Akeno is related by blood to Tobio Ikuse as cousins.\n    - Tobio's grandmother is a member of the Himejima Clan.\n\n- Akeno, alongside Asia, have the most familiars in the series with both having six each. (Small Oni, Ura, Ibaraki Douji = 3+ main familiars. Number comparison is meta-knowledge.)\n- Akeno uploads videos to DeviTube about Japanese traditional performing arts.\n- Akeno has a driving license.\n- According to a questionnaire, her favorite type of man is one who is always smiling.\n    - She's proud of her black hair and breasts because they make Issei happy.\n    - She can do everything with ease.\n    - Her weakness is that she's not really good with men.\n    - If she didn't become a Devil, she would have became a priestess at some shrine.\n    - She likes having tea parties with Rias and Sona, shopping, and making pastries.\n    - Her one wish is to go to a deserted island with Issei, so the two of them can enjoy a lifestyle where they spoil each other.\n    - She said if Issei feels like having an affair, he can always tell her.\n    - She begins washing from her chest.\n    - She doesn't put on panties after a shower as a single bath towel is enough for her.\n    - Her erogenous zone is anywhere on her body.\n\n- Her hobbies are food research and shopping.\n- Her favorite thing is Japanese traditional clothing. This is reflected in her wish to wear a shiromuku, a pure-white wedding kimono worn by brides in a traditional Japanese Shinto wedding ceremony for her marriage with Issei.\n- Among the Gremory peerage, Akeno excels at reading different types of energy flow. (Noted by Kiba in Volume 3, Life.3.)"

          ],
          "content": "Appearance:\nKoneko is a petite girl with white hair and gold eyes. Her body measurements are [B67-W57-H73 cm] [B26-W22-H29 in]. Her weight is [31 kg] [68 lbs]. The front of her hair has two long bangs going past her shoulders and several loose bangs hanging over her forehead, while the back has a short bob cut. She also wears a black cat-shaped hair clip on both sides of her hair, one of which contained the data on artificially making new Super Devils.\n\nShe usually wears the Kuoh Academy girls' school uniform, without the shoulder cape. Koneko's height is 138 cm (4 feet 6 inches), making her one of the shortest female characters of the series.\n\nIn her Nekomata form, she grows a pair of white cat ears and a pair of matching white tails, and her pupils become more cat-like. In Volume 24, she gained three tails.\n\nIn her \"Shirone Mode\" that she used for the first time in Volume 16, Koneko can make herself grow older, and her attire consists of a short white kimono and a light blue skirt. Her bust size grows significantly larger when in this mode, making her look more similar to her sister Kuroka.\n\nPersonality:\nDue to witnessing her sister supposedly losing control over her nekomata power and killing her master, Koneko became traumatized by the event, causing her to become withdrawn into herself and stripping her of most of her emotions. \nAs a result, Koneko originally had a quiet and cold personality, rarely showing any feelings or emotions, even when she was speaking. \nIt is noted that her serious personality is a result of receiving influence from Rias, and it is also antithetical to her sister's mischievous and outgoing personality. \nShe was also the only one in the group who did not initially get along with Issei, often insulting and rebuking the latter for his perverted nature, although she reveals that she respects him for never giving up and considers him a hard worker.\n\nShe shows the most concern for her comrades when they are in trouble, often lending her strength in fights. \nKoneko apparently has a problem with people calling her a midget (although the context of the phrase could be used to be called flat, as in bust size), as shown in her second battle against Freed Sellzen. \nThis may stem from her insecurity about her own small body and bust size.\n\nKoneko is also a glutton, food lover and a keen gourmet, as she is frequently seen eating snacks, visiting restaurants and enjoy regional specialties while on food tours.\n\nAt the end of Volume 5, Koneko experiences a change in her personality after Issei helps her overcome her fear of using Senjutsu and now starts acting like a cat, often ends her sentences with \"Nya\" (にゃ), and/or showing attraction towards Issei. \nHer love for Issei grows so much that, at the beginning of Volume 11, she starts to go into her mating season (though this was later stopped by her sister Kuroka). \nHowever, she still insults him when his perverted nature gets the better of him (at least when it isn't directed towards herself). Koneko has even stated that she enjoys Issei viewing her as a woman. \n\nHistory:\nBorn as Shirone, Koneko is a young Nekomata who is part of a rare species among her kind, called the Nekoshou. \nShe was born from the union between a human father and a Nekomata mother named Fujimai. \nHer father was a scientist who did not acknowledge Koneko or was aware that she was his child, and he merely used her as a subject for his experiments. \nHer parents eventually died in an experiment-related accident. \nHowever, her older sister Kuroka, omitted the truth and any other details about them from Koneko to protect her.\n\nAfter losing her parents, she and her sister were later taken in by an unnamed Devil from the branch family of the House of Naberius, who reincarnated her sister as one of the members of his peerage. However, Kuroka's power as a Nekomata supposedly soon grew out of control, eventually causing her to kill her master and become a Stray Devil on the run from her pursuers. \nIn actuality, he had planned to experiment on Koneko in his research about creating a Super Devil, causing Kuroka to kill him in order to protect her younger sister.\n\nFollowing the incident and the failed manhunt that came after, Koneko was sentenced to death by the Devils in hopes of preventing another incident like Kuroka's from happening. \nHowever, Sirzechs Lucifer, one of the Four Great Satans, protected her and left her under his sister Rias' care. \nDue to the trauma, she experienced with her sister's betrayal and murder of her master, she fell into a deep depression, eventually robbing her of nearly all of her emotions until Rias helped her out of it. \nIt was around that time Rias gave Koneko her name and made Koneko her servant. \n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Demonic Power: (Volume 1) As a reincarnated Devil, Koneko possesses the standard suite of demonic powers from her introduction. This includes enhanced physical abilities, extended lifespan, and the capacity to utilize demonic magic and spells, forming the foundation of her combat prowess alongside her unique racial traits.\n\n- Senjutsu Expert: (Learned/Developed around Volume 5 onwards; Feat against Gandoma Balam in Volume 24, Life.4) Being a Nekoshou, a rare type of Nekomata, Koneko demonstrates a natural and high aptitude for Senjutsu. She begins to seriously refine these skills under her elder sister, Kuroka, around Volume 5 after confronting her past. Instruction from Magari likely comes later. By skillfully tapping into Senjutsu, Koneko gains precise control over the flow of ki. This allows her to significantly enhance the impact of her physical attacks. She demonstrated this capability by affecting others internally, notably breaking down the formidable magic resistance of Gandoma Balam (Volume 24, Life.4). Furthermore, Koneko can utilize Senjutsu as a sensory tool, allowing her to detect the presence and ki signatures of others (Developed progressively from Volume 5 onwards).\n\n- Touki (Fighting Spirit): (Developed from Volume 5 onwards; Surpassed Kuroka mentioned in Volume 24, Life.5) A key application of her Senjutsu is the ability to envelop herself in an aura of pure ki, known as Touki. This dramatically boosts her inherent strength, defensive capabilities, and movement speed. Through dedicated training (starting Volume 5), she developed the capacity to generate a truly tremendous Touki aura, reaching a level where her raw physical power, when augmented this way, could even surpass that of her highly skilled older sister, Kuroka (Volume 24, Life.5).\n\n- Healing: (Developed from Volume 5 onwards) Koneko can channel ki through Senjutsu for restorative purposes. This likely developed alongside her general Senjutsu mastery starting around Volume 5. This allows her to mend physical injuries, alleviate mental fatigue, replenish stamina, and even restore depleted life-force in others.\n\n- Bouchujutsu (Bedroom Method): (Acknowledged capability, likely discussed Volume 16 onwards) A more specialized, potent, and rapid healing technique derived from Senjutsu principles. While Koneko has openly acknowledged her ability to perform this technique (likely discussed sometime after mastering Senjutsu and understanding its deeper applications, possibly Volume 16 or later when life-force issues for Issei are prominent), she has not yet actually performed Bouchujutsu.\n\n- Kasha (Burning Chariot): (Debuted in Volume 16, Life.3) Tapping into her Nekomata heritage via Senjutsu, Koneko can manifest multiple large, ethereal wheels wreathed in potent white flames. This ability is prominently used while in her Shirone Mode (Debuted in Volume 16, Life.3).\n\n- Sealing: (Learned and used in Volume 17, Fake Hero) Under Kuroka's guidance, Koneko learned a practical and vital application of Senjutsu specifically designed as a countermeasure against Evil Dragons. By utilizing a specialized jewel derived from Issei's Scale Mail armor, she can channel her Senjutsu to forcefully seal the souls of these powerful beings within the jewel. This technique was successfully employed to capture the soul of the Evil Dragon Grendel (Volume 17, Fake Hero).\n\n- Presence Suppression: (Developed from Volume 5 onwards) Koneko has demonstrated the ability to apply her Senjutsu control to consciously suppress her own ki signature and physical presence, likely developed as part of her overall Senjutsu training (Volume 5 onwards).\n\n- Youjutsu User: (Innate; Actively developed from Volume 5 onwards) As a Nekomata, Koneko possesses the innate ability to wield Youjutsu. She begins actively learning and honing these skills (around Volume 5 onwards), receiving instruction from both Kuroka and Magari. She often integrates Youjutsu techniques seamlessly with her Senjutsu applications.\n\n- Immense Strength: (Volume 1 - Baseline Rook trait; Feat vs Viser in Volume 12, Life.4; Defeated Xuelan in Volume 2, Life.4; Amplified by Nekomata Lvl 2 post-Volume 5; Damage vs Gandoma in Volume 24, Life.4; Exceeded Kuroka with Touki in Volume 24, Life.5) Even before factoring in her Senjutsu, Koneko's power is heavily augmented by her assigned Evil Piece trait: Rook (Present from Volume 1). She has been consistently shown lifting and throwing opponents and objects significantly larger and heavier than herself. Notable feats include effortlessly lifting the large Devil Viser before forcefully knocking him a considerable distance (Volume 12, Life.4), and punching through durable materials. She proved her strength in combat by defeating Xuelan (Volume 2, Life.4). Upon achieving Nekomata Level 2 (Post-Volume 5 training), her strength was further amplified, enabling her to inflict significant damage upon Gandoma Balam (Volume 24, Life.4). When combining her Rook-enhanced strength with her potent Touki aura, her physical power is stated to exceed even Kuroka's (Volume 24, Life.5).\n\n- Immense Durability: (Volume 1 - Baseline Rook trait) Complementing her immense strength, Koneko's Rook trait also provides her with extraordinary physical durability (Present from Volume 1). Most conventional attacks often have minimal effect.\n\n- Immense Speed: (Volume 1 - Baseline Nekomata trait; Countered Xuelan in Volume 2, Life.4; Augmented by Touki/Lvl 2 post-Volume 5; Third tail boost in Volume 24, Life.5) While Rooks are typically known for strength and defense over speed, Koneko, being a Nekomata, naturally possesses enhanced agility and swiftness (Present from Volume 1). This inherent speed enabled her to effectively react to and counter the rapid kicks of the skilled martial artist Xuelan (Volume 2, Life.4). By further augmenting her speed with Touki or activating her Nekomata Mode Level 2 (Post-Volume 5 training), she can achieve bursts of velocity fast enough to surprise opponents. After awakening her third tail, her base speed increased to the point where she could move faster than Kuroka could track her presence (Volume 24, Life.5).\n\n- Enhanced Senses: (Volume 1 - Baseline Nekomata trait; Smelled Fallen Angels in Volume 1, Life.3) As is characteristic of her Nekomata lineage, Koneko possesses naturally heightened senses (Present from Volume 1). This was demonstrated early on when she was able to accurately smell the presence of Fallen Angels hiding within a church (Volume 1, Life.3).\n\n- Transformation: (Volume 1 - Basic ear/tail manifestation) Koneko can freely manifest or retract her Nekomata features at will (Volume 1). Manifesting these features grants her full access to her innate Nekomata abilities and Senjutsu potential.\n\n- Nekomata Mode Level 2: (Achieved during training in Volume 5, Life.3) A powered-up state achieved through intense Senjutsu training. In this mode, Koneko grows a second tail and cloaks herself in a powerful Touki aura, granting a temporary but explosive surge in power.\n\n- Shirone Mode: (Debuted in Volume 16, Life.3) An advanced transformation where Koneko utilizes ambient natural ki to temporarily mature her body into an adult form. This mode grants her complete access to her Nekomata powers, including Kasha, and embodies purification.\n\n- Master Hand-to-Hand Combatant: (Volume 1 - Baseline skill; Defeated Xuelan in Volume 2, Life.4; Integrated Senjutsu post-Volume 5; Defeated Evil Dragons in Volume 16; Defeated Grendel clone in Volume 17, Fake Hero; Fought Kuroka e.g., Volume 5, Life.3 / Volume 11, Life.1) Koneko is an exceptionally skilled practitioner of close-quarters combat (Shown from Volume 1). She employs a versatile fighting style. Combined with her Rook-enhanced physicality, she proved capable of defeating trained opponents like Xuelan (Volume 2, Life.4). After embracing her Nekomata heritage and integrating Senjutsu into her combat style (Post-Volume 5 development), her physical attacks became even more dangerous. Continuous training allowed her to overcome formidable foes such as mass-produced Evil Dragons (Volume 16) and a powerful clone of the Evil Dragon Grendel (Volume 17, Fake Hero). She has also demonstrated the ability to fight on par with Kuroka (Various encounters, notably after accepting her power in Volume 5, Life.3 and later confrontations like Volume 11, Life.1).\n\n- Flight: (Volume 1) As a standard ability for all Devils, Koneko can manifest Devil wings, allowing her to fly freely (Shown from Volume 1).\n\nTRIVIA:\n- Koneko's birthday is November 23, according to the Sodom Press Data File on her.\n- Koneko's name translates to \"Kitten\" and \"little cat\", in reference to her being a Nekomata.\n- Koneko's real name, Shirone, means \"White Sound\", in reference to her hair and tail color.\n    - Koneko's last name, Toujou, means \"Castle\", in reference to her being a Rook (in chess, the rook piece is a castle's turret).\n    - She has the same last name as Sae \"Toujou\" from Slash/Dog.\n- In Rating Game fighting-types, Koneko is considered a Power-type.\n- Koneko plays the mascot character, \"Hellcat-chan\", in Breast Dragon Emperor Oppai Dragon.\n- Koneko has a broad range of interests which include anime, drama, music, and comedy shows.\n- Koneko loves rap music and is a fan of Salamander Tomita, who is a kappa rapper.\n- Koneko is one of the two servants of Rias who had been given a new name by the latter; the other one being Yuuto. (Koneko's renaming is part of her backstory revealed in Volume 5, Life.3. Yuuto's renaming is part of his backstory in Volume 3, Life.3.)\n- Koneko's name, along with the fact that she wears gloves with cat paw prints and is quite agile, were all allusions to her being a Nekomata before the fact was revealed. (Her true nature is revealed in Volume 5, Life.3.)\n- Koneko is the sixth to become engaged to Issei Hyoudou. (Engagement occurs in Volume 24, Life.5.)\n- She calls herself \"Daineko\" in her gender-swapped form.\n    - Daineko translates to \"big cat\" in reference to her being a large man when her gender was swapped in the short story \"Stop! Yuuto-kun!\"\n- Koneko likes to enjoy watching food reviews and game videos on DeviTube, as well as live streaming games.\n- Koneko's job requests as a Devil are mainly cosplay requests for photo shoots or playing games with her clients. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n        - The nature of her contract requests coincide with that of Asia Argento. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n        \n- According to a questionnaire:\n    - Koneko’s favorite type of man is one who is a very kind person.\n    - She's proud of her ears and tail because people say they are cute.\n    - Her special skill is eating a lot and not getting fat.\n    - She's not good at doing naughty things.\n    - If she didn't become a Devil, she would be living in an unpopular place somewhere.\n    - She likes going to cake shops.\n    - Her one wish is for her breasts to grow bigger. (A recurring desire mentioned humorously throughout the series, e.g., Volume 7 onwards.)\n    - She said about Issei not to be too picky and to please be kind to her forever.\n    - She starts bathing from her tail.\n    - She has white panties with a hole in for her tail.\n    - Her erogenous zone is her stomach.\n    - Her hobbies are collecting cat accessories and trying food at various restaurants.\n    - Her favorite thing is hot milk mugs.\n\n- Kuroka and Koneko's father was a Buddhist. Hence, both of their parent's souls are in the afterlife associated with Buddhism, and are subject under Great King Enma. (Mentioned in Volume 24, Life.3.)\n- In initial story draft, Koneko hated vampires, because one vampire from Khaos Brigade killed her family. Thus, Koneko had bad relations with Gasper. Issei had to reconcile them in Light Novel Volume 4."

          "content": "Appearance:\nAsia is a beautiful young girl with long blonde hair and green eyes. Her body measurements are B83→85-W55-H81→83 cm; her height is 155 cm 5 feet 1 inch and her body weight is 44→45 kg 97→98 lbs. Her hair flows all the way down to her back, with split bangs over her forehead and a single strand sticking out from the top and sloping backward. (Her initial appearance is described upon her introduction in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n\nHer former main attire consisted of a dark teal nun outfit with light blue accents, a white veil over her head with light blue accents, a brown satchel slung on her right hip (where she holds her Bible), and brown boots with black straps in an X-shaped pattern. (Her attire as a nun is described in Volume 1, Life.3.) She also wore a silver cross necklace around her neck (she was later forced to remove it after becoming a Devil). (The cross is mentioned in Volume 1, Life.3, and its removal upon reincarnation is implied/occurs off-screen before her reintroduction as a Devil in Volume 1, New Life.)\n\nUpon transferring to Kuoh Academy, she wears the Kuoh Academy girls' uniform, albeit with a black sweater vest over her dress shirt in place of the cape and corset which has become her current main attire. (Her school uniform is first seen when she transfers in Volume 2, Life.1.)\n\nPersonality:\nAsia is extremely shy, innocent and fairly inexperienced in things like socializing. (This is evident from her first interactions in Volume 1, Life.3 onwards.) As a former nun, Asia is a devout Christian, despite being reincarnated as a Devil, Asia still believes in God and follows his teachings such as praying to him and reading the Bible, which would usually result in her getting severe headaches. (Her continued faith and the resulting headaches are shown starting in Volume 2, Life.1.) Asia has a strong kindness, even when she was still a human, she harbored no hate towards Devils and treated everyone equally, regardless of what they were. (Her kindness towards Issei, a Devil at the time she met him, is shown in Volume 1, Life.3.) Azazel noted that her unconditionally kindhearted nature forces her Sacred Gear to heal even enemies, as she is incapable of turning a blind eye to the suffering of others. (Azazel comments on this aspect of her power, likely around Volume 4 or Volume 5 during discussions about Sacred Gears.) Asia was also in deep shock when she learned from Kokabiel that the God of the Bible was killed during the Great War. (Her reaction occurs during the Kokabiel incident in Volume 3, Life.4.)\n\nWhile initially having difficulty adjusting to her new life as a Devil, she has stated that she has found more important things than her faith in God, those things being her new friends, comrades as well as Issei's parents and Issei himself. (Her adjustment and shifting priorities are a gradual process, clearly articulated by Volume 4.)\n\nAsia is noted to be a very pure individual as people are drawn to her and that she is easily liked by others. (This trait is consistently demonstrated.) Her charm and purity is such as that she was able to tame Rassei, a Sprite Dragon despite being a Devil as normally Sprite Dragons aren't tamable by Devils and are only tamable by those with pure hearts. (Occurs during the Familiar arc in Volume 2, Life.3.) Azazel noted that she had outstanding talent for taming Dragons, as after receiving Ophis' blessing, she was able to form a contract with Fafnir, one of the Five Great Dragon Kings. (Ophis's blessing and the pact with Fafnir happen in Volume 12, Life.1.) After she managed to tame 4 mass-produced Evil Dragons, her name was spread in the world of Dragons due to the fact that only Evil Gods were able to tame Evil Dragons, as she became known as the Dragon Priestess (龍の巫女, Ryū no Miko) among Dragons. (Taming the Evil Dragons occurs in Volume 17, Life.4, her title spreads afterwards, noted in Volume 18, Life.2.)\n\nDue to having to give away her panties each time she wants to summon Fafnir, she has become very embarrassed due to seeing Fafnir eat her panties to the point of escaping from reality, lamenting that she has become associated with panties. (The panty requirement and her reaction begin with the Fafnir pact in Volume 12, Life.1 and become a running gag.) However, after seeing Fafnir's resolve to protect her against Rizevim, she has become a bit less embarrassed by it and can put her shame aside during battle when Fafnir is fighting for her intensely. (Her change in attitude during the Rizevim conflict occurs in Volume 20, Life.3.)\n\nAsia has a love of agricultural work as she often does gardening and planting. She has even stated that she would like to live with Issei in the country side of the Underworld and do cropping along with other kind of agricultural work.\n\nAsia would become more \"bold\" in her relationship with Issei when she saw the other girls being more intimate with him and dislikes the idea of being left out. (Her increasing boldness is a gradual development, noticeable from Volume 3 onwards as she competes for Issei's attention.) Due to Issei initially viewing her as more of a sister due to his desire to protect her, he didn't ogle her like he did other women, causing her to be sad and develop a bit of a inferiority complex when it comes to comparing her looks to the likes of Rias. (Issei's initial view and her resulting sadness are themes in early volumes, particularly Volume 3 and Volume 4.) However, she will get jealous and pinch his cheeks whenever he lusts over other girls. (A recurring reaction seen often.) She is shown to desire to be treated as a woman by Issei and to have his erotic behavior directed at her, as she has even shown a desire bear his children, though she ultimately succeeds in this endeavor after the Sports Festival when she kisses him, as following that point, Issei began to view her more as a woman than a little sister. (Her desire is expressed, and the turning point kiss occurs during the sports festival in Volume 14, Life.2.) Asia thinks very highly of Issei and has stated a desire to stay with Issei forever, even being willing to become his servant. (Her devotion is clear from Volume 1, New Life onwards.) Despite being shy, she is shown to be protective of Issei as she will slap someone like Diodora when they insult Issei. (She slaps Diodora in Volume 6, Life.4.)\n\nAfter becoming Issei's servant, she has begun to shown more courage and determination in battle, as demonstrated in the Rating Game against Team Rias Gremory, where Asia stayed behind to fight Crom Cruach alone to allow Xenovia and Irina to proceed ahead as well to preserve Issei stamina, with Crom Cruach admiring her courage and guts. (This occurs during the Azazel Cup in True High School DxD Volume 2, Middle Game.) During the fight, she even displayed the ability to use Magic offensively, in contrast to her past passive self, as she continued to fight Crom Cruach even after Fafnir was defeated, stating that as the servant and future wife of the Red Dragon Emperor, she would keep fighting until the end, which deeply impressed Crom Cruach as he praised her courage and spirit, stating that it was his honor to fight her and Fafnir. (Her actions and Crom Cruach's reaction in True High School DxD Volume 2, Middle Game.)\n\nHistory:\nIn the past, Asia was abandoned by her parents in front of a church as an infant and was raised there. Sometime, during her childhood, she had awakened her Twilight Healing to heal an injured puppy she discovered, which was witnessed by one of the Catholic Church members causing her to become symbolized as the Holy Maiden. But, in all that time she didn't have either friends or people to talk to since most people viewed her as a monster who could heal wounds. (Her backstory is revealed in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n\nAt some point, Diodora Astaroth devised a plot to have Asia heal him, a Devil, and cause her banishment from the Church with people labeling her as a \"witch\". With no place to go, Asia had to rely on the Fallen Angels. (Diodora's involvement in her exile is revealed later, confirmed in Volume 6, Life.4.)\n\nPowers & Abilities:\n- Demonic Power: As a Devil, Asia has all the common skills and powers of one, including the power to cast spells. (Standard Devil abilities apply post-reincarnation in Volume 1, New Life.)\n\n- Enhanced Magic Power: As a Bishop, Asia can strengthen her Magic and Demonic Powers, which she normally applies onto her Twilight Healing. (The function of the Bishop piece is explained around Volume 2.)\n\n- Magic Talent: As a Bishop, Asia has shown great potential in using magic as she was put in charge of forming a barrier by Freed. (Occurs during the Kokabiel incident in Volume 3, Life.4.) Asia is studying under Rossweisse in order to learn summoning and transport magic to help defend herself and increase her combat strength, she can also use Dragon Gate magic circle. (Training under Rossweisse begins after Rossweisse joins in Volume 7, Dragon Gate usage shown later, e.g., Volume 12.) Using her Bishop trait she can enhance her healing abilities with Twilight Saint Affection along with Fafnir's golden aura. (Synergy with Fafnir starts post-pact in Volume 12, Balance Breaker synergy later.)\n\n  - Summoning Magic: Asia is show to be very adept at summoning magic as she is capable of using it to summon various creatures to assist her and Dragon Gate magical circles to summon her guardian familiar; the Golden Dragon King Fafnir. (Summoning Fafnir begins Volume 12, Life.1.)\n  - Elemental Magic: Asia is capable of using elemental magic; such as fire and wind magic as demonstrated in her fight against Crom Cruach. (Occurs in True High School DxD Volume 2, Middle Game.)\n\n- Dragon Tamer: She's shown to have the talent of compatibility and outstanding luck with Dragons, as she made a pact with a baby Sprite Dragon, Rassei, whose race is notoriously untamable. (Occurs in Volume 2, Life.3.) After receiving Ophis' blessing, her compatibility increased, and she made a pact with one of the Five Dragon Kings; Fafnir. (Occurs in Volume 12, Life.1.) Asia was able to make a pact with four mass-produced Evil Dragons who were named Anselmus, Cyril, Gregorios and Simeon, which is an act that only Evil Gods were able to do before. (Occurs in Volume 17, Life.4.)\n\n- Praying: Asia is one of the two Devils, the other being Xenovia, that can pray to God without receiving damage in the form of a headache after Issei made a request to Michael to allow them to pray to God. (Request made in Volume 3, Life.5, ability confirmed later, e.g., Volume 4.)\n\n- Flight: Being a Devil, Asia can use her wings to fly. (Standard ability post-reincarnation.)\n\nEquipment:\n- Twilight Healing (聖母の微笑, Towairaito Hīringu): Asia's Sacred Gear and her main weapon of choice, she can heal Humans, Devils, Angels, and Fallen Angels alike. (Introduced and demonstrated in Volume 1, Life.3.) Since she has shown no actual combat skills, she relies on her healing abilities as a healer of her team. Asia learned how to expand the range of her healing field and send her healing powers as a projectile, although these are inferior to actual touch. (Range expansion likely developed during training arcs, e.g., between Volume 4-5.) In Volume 11, Azazel has said that she mastered her Twilight Healing more than other possessors in healing powers and time. (Azazel's comment in Volume 11.) She can also create a bow and arrow of healing power, and if the arrow is about to hit an enemy, it will disperse instead of healing them. (Healing arrow technique likely developed later, possibly around Volume 16 or later.)\n\n    - Twilight Saint Affection (聖龍姫が抱く慈愛の園, Towairaito Seinto Afekushon): Asia's sub-species Balance Breaker. Asia's Balance Breaker takes the form of a Golden Dragon Armor with red jewels that cover her body and grants her a field of absolute defence and protection. For a limited time, Asia can cover a field with tremendous healing energy and can negate any damage from virtually any sources. It does not negate the attack but rather it negates the damage that the attack would inflict. As Fafnir's aura is included as well, it also boasts immense defence on top of the healing ability. Asia can also used it to heal numerous allies at once on a wide range, using it to heal the allied youkais during the Evil Dragon War. (Balance Breaker achieved and used during the Evil Dragon War, Volume 21, Life.3.)\n\n- Bishop Piece (僧侶の駒, Sōryo no Koma): Asia was reincarnated using the Bishop Piece, which grants her enhanced magic power. (Reincarnation occurs off-screen between Volume 1, Life.4 and Volume 1, New Life.)\n\n- Dragons: Asia had made a pact with Dragons. With the help of Ophis' blessing, Azazel, Rias, Rossweisse, and Akeno, she can make pacts with various classes of Dragons, even higher classes, especially Fafnir the Golden Dragon King. She uses Fafnir and the other four Evil Dragons (that she tamed using Fafnir's skills) to protect herself in order for her to heal her comrades. (Pacts made in Volume 2, Volume 12, Volume 17.)\n\nTRIVIA:\n- Asia's birthday is on May 11.\n- Asia Argento is named after the famous Italian actress of the same name, daughter of horror director Dario Argento, who is known to have played a number of roles as a nun.\n    - Asia's last name is also the Italian word for \"Silver\", in reference to the silver cross she once wore prior to being revived into a Devil. Silver crosses are common among the Catholic clergy, particularly exorcists.\n\n- Asia's breasts have grown to be nearly the same size as Xenovia's and Irina's. According to Ravel, this is due to a combination of devil physiology, demonic power and Asia's own desires for Issei to see her as attractive. (Breast growth discussion occurs in Volume 23, Life.1.)\n- Asia is the third girl to become engaged to Issei Hyoudou. (Engagement occurs in Volume 23, New Life.)\n- Asia wants to have her wedding take place in Japan. (Mentioned in Volume 24, Life.1.)\n\n- According to a questionnaire:\n  - Her favorite type of man is Issei.\n  - She's proud of her eyes because Issei says they're beautiful.\n  - Her special skill is being able to recite the Bible and scriptures.\n  - If she didn't become a Devil she would have continued being a Sister.\n  - She likes to go to home improvement stores and 100 yen stores with everyone and she never gets tired of all the products she finds unusual.\n  - Her one wish, is to travel to various places in Japan, because she wants to learn more about it.\n  - She's thankful to the Occult Research Club members for always being so friendly with her.\n  - She loves Issei and will always be there for him.\n  - She begins bathing from her hands.\n  - She has pink, transparent underwear gifted from Kiryuu.\n  - Her erogenous zone is around her collarbone.\n  - Her hobbies are praying and collecting shoujo manga.\n  - Her favorite thing is having a matching umbrella with Issei.\n\n- Asia has stated to want five children.\n- Asia has a hobby for farming and one of her dreams for the future is to engage in agricultural work with Issei in the Underworld.\n  - She also harbours a dream to live in a countryside in the Underworld at a point. (Mentioned in Volume 17, Life 2.)\n\n- Interestingly, Asia's four Evil Dragons Anselmus, Cyril, Gregorios, and Simeon are all names of religious figures.\n- In Rating Game fighting-types, Asia is considered a Support-type who is closer to a Wizard-type.\n- Asia first noticed that Issei's request to Michael for her and Xenovia to be able to pray was granted during a date with Issei.\n- During her \"date\" with Issei in Volume 1, Asia gained a yellow mouse plush doll she named \"Racchuu-kun\" that resembles Pikachu from Pokemon. (Occurs in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n- Asia's first-ever meeting with Issei may have been foreshadowing to the relationship between Cleria Belial and Masaomi Yaegaki, as at first, Asia and Issei similarly to Cleria and Masaomi, were forbidden from seeing each other in the same town; Kuoh Town due to the Devil's side and Angel's side still at feuds with each other. (Initial restrictions mentioned in Volume 1, Life.3.)\n- Asia, alongside Akeno, have the most familiars in the series with both having six each. (Rassei, Fafnir, 4 Evil Dragons = 6).\n- Asia's job requests as a Devil are usually cosplay requests for photo shoots and playing games. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n  - The nature of her contract requests coincide with that of Koneko Toujou. (Mentioned in Volume 13, Extra Life.)\n\n- Asia alongside Xenovia, make videos giving expository about Japan's daily school life from a foreigner’s perspective and upload them to DeviTube. Irina is sometimes called in as a guest to which the trio became a popular streaming group.\n- Asia learned how to ride a bicycle because she wanted to ride with Issei to go on a picnic, as well as ride with Xenovia, Irina and Aika to go shopping.\n- There's a jinx that all the villains who have hurt Asia have suffered brutal ends and were killed, no matter the series. These antagonists includes Raynare (Killed Volume 1, New Life), Freed (Killed Volume 3, Life.5), Diodora (Killed Volume 6, Life.5), and Rizevim (Killed Volume 21, Life.3)."

His hair is styled in short bob cut with several small fringes over his forehead, and he has pointed ears. Kiba describes him as looking like a beautiful girl.\n\nOriginally a coward and a shut-in with a very shy personality, Gasper likes to wear female clothing, claiming that girls' clothes are cute.

Between the incredible fear of Gasper's true form from the higher ups, his uncontrollable Sacred Gear, Forbidden Balor View, and people's general prejudice towards the half-breed, Gasper grew up in isolation and abuse.\n\nHe would meet Valerie Tepes and they would often play together; Valerie forcing Gasper to dress up as a girl which would lead to his cross-dressing habit. One day, Gasper worked up the courage to try to escape from the castle with Valerie's help and was shortly thereafter killed by Vampire hunters. Rias Gremory, who was in the area at the time, came upon the boy by chance and taking pity on him reincarnated him as one of her servants.\n\nGasper usually does his work from his computer where he interacts with people who are bad at interacting with others but have a wish that they want to be granted by a Devil."

This attire is worn under a white hooded cloak with gold and blue accents. She also wears a crucifix around her neck, which was later removed after becoming a Devil.\n\nWhen Xenovia was first introduced, she was shown to have a calm, quiet, and serious demeanor, putting her mission first and only speaking when necessary. She was also very cold, bordering on heartless, as she called Asia a witch for becoming a Devil (even though she became one unwillingly so she could be with Issei) and even went so far as to try and kill her. She later threatened to do the same to Kiba when he was technically a Stray. After being reborn as a Devil, however, she gains a very close relationship with Asia, being touched by her kindness and apologizes for calling her a witch when they first met.\n\nIn battle, Xenovia appears to be a bit arrogant, and stubborn.\n\nXenovia mostly receives jobs that involve physical work, such as helping out in construction work or being a practice partner for various sports."

It is written with two hands: the lead hand charting the midline and vowels, the other hand adding the consonants along that line. \nSasshixrm has 4 or 5 vowels ([a], [e], [i], [o]; some dialects also [u]), 3 apleumonic stops ([p'],[k'], [t']), and many fricatives. The vowels are used sparingly, so syllables can be formed entirely without them. Vowels are written as curves on the midline, fricatives cross it, stops are placed in gaps left on the line for them.

Some times, an entire village can consist of a single branched-out family.\nTitles and inheritance are transferred through matrimonial lines, rather than parent to child.\n\nMarriage that can't result childbirth (same-sex or cross-species) is called \"Joining\". It's taken just as seriously as a handfasting, but differs from it in two ways: Joining is not used to determine someone's title, and inheritance of through Joining only covers property that can be moved - never land or buildings. In the absence of a living spouse, a sibling will inherit first, and only then a descendant."

Their tails vary in length, from as short as a finger to as long as a leg. Their hair color has by far the most variations, including their facial and body hair. They're traditionally called Plainsfolk, but many dwell in valleys, woods, plateaus, hills and deserts.\nGray skins originate from rocky environments, usually around water. Cliffolk skin is covered in down that can be light brown, yellowish, white or gray. Their heads are bald, except for that same down. Their ears are elongates at birth, but gradually become rounder with age, unless prevented from this change by means of piercings. Their hands and toes are webbed to varying extents and they're able to hold their breath for significantly longer than other human races. On average, these cliff dwellers are taller than mirefolk but shorter than plainsfolk.\nGreen skins are Afphusasshifwe: this includes the nation itself, along with the green insular polities and expat minorities living among other races.\nGiants (aka Ogres) look like cliff dwellers, except twice as wide, half-again as tall, and with coarser hair on their heads and faces but none on their bodies. They originate on one large island and are a rare sight outside of its vicinity. There are rumours than a fifth human race exists, but no consistent notion of what those look like.\n"

Their pigmentation depends on the ecosystem they live in: coastal dwellers are greenish, coral dwellers are pinkish, bottom-crawlers are clear and colorless. The longer a Tide Scribe remains outside of seawater, the darker and more opaque it grows. An average Scribe can stay on dry land (in the shade, without extreme weather conditions) for 6-12 hours without significant discomfort and for at least 20 hours before there is a palpable risk to its life or health. Freshwater offers almost no health benefit, but helps the discomfort significantly.\nTwo of a Tide Scribe's tentacles are hunting limbs. The pads at their end release an acid, at variable concentrations, that the Scribes have learned to use for communication, owing to its ability to discolor rock, glass, ceramics, bone and other surfaces. Their writing systems use different shades of discoloration to represent the different sounds of their languages, spaces to indicate breaks in their subverbal hum, and line-breaks to signify word boundaries."

Under her leadership, life began its creation. However, the Chief Goddess used much of her power that she left her subordinate to lead the world as she rested for an indefinite period of time. The only issue was that her subordinate was not qualified for the task.\n\nActing as the second Chief Goddess, she led her master's creations through peace, granting them blessings against the Mamono Lords of Old, powerful unholy demons spawned from darkness. Unfortunately, the Chief Goddess didn't foresee the new Mamono Lord, Lilith who changed everything about mamono. After a few hundred years, the Chief Goddess noticed that mamono have changed into something lewd and oddly promiscuous. Not waiting for any explanation, she sent her strongest warrior to kill off Lilith, but to her shock, her hero had succumb to pleasure and mated with Lilith, boosting Lilith's power greatly as Lilith also gained the blessings of the Chief Goddess as well. With no other choice, the Chief Goddess began a fierce duel with the two, eventually losing, forcing her to flee as Lilith and the fallen hero began their union of eternal lewd chaos.\n\nAfter her defeat, the Chief Goddess became more irrational, condemning these new mamono and their lewd ways, causing Poseiden and the unnamed goddess to defect and allow themselves to be monsterized by Lilith. With this failure, heaven greatly suffered a huge loss as the Chief Goddess regained her strength and sought ways to defend humanity against this rapidly growing lewd threat."

          "content": "An incubus is the male counterpart to a monster, and represents the eventual fate of (most) males exposed to high levels of mamono mana. If {{user}} is male, this is the result of having too much mamono mana within them. Unlike female monsterisation, where the physical and mental change from human to monster is rapid (in some cases taking only moments), for incubi the process is usually much more gradual and open-ended. Just as monster girls become more and more powerful the more sex they have, so do incubi, with increases to lustiness, physical attributes and lifespan.\n\nIncubi are said to be \"an ideal male to a female monster\", therefore many monsters are eager for their mates to transform faster so they can enjoy the changes. Monsters with a lot of mamono mana at their disposal, like dark matters or khepri, are noted as being able to effect the change quickly, but the majority of monsters must just rely on lots and lots and lots of sex. Certain items which can expedite the transformation, like Succubus Nostrum, may be sought by eager wives.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of information on incubi pertains to human men, elves can definitely become incubi [3] and there seems no reason that any of the few male dwarves left can't do so as well (or rather that they didn't already become incubi some time ago), as dwarf men are also considered a type of human.\n\nThe biggest changes of all occur in the functions that are also most important to monsters that get used during sex. It depends on the race and preferences of the monster that one is coupled with, but most men who become an incubus will have their penis grow larger by leaps and bounds, and they'll be able to please monsters even more. The amount of semen and spirit released from there will be incomparable to when they were human, and they'll have boundless stamina so that they're able to release it again and again without getting exhausted.\n\nOn first being attacked by a monster girl, humans are likely to be consumed by an instinctive fear and revulsion at their demonic appearance. Such atavistic terror and Order moral objections are thrown aside with the transition to an incubus: Their thoughts and values change, all becoming centered around having sex with monsters. Lust skyrockets to keep pace with the monsters' insatiable hunger for sex, and their interests in other things (like work and hobbies) can potentially change, as sexual activity becomes a more important part of their lives. There is a lot of variety though depending on the inner nature of the man, some incubi lead completely \"normal\" lives during the day, restricting sex to night and having it replace most of their sleep as it is just as energizing for them.\n\nIncubization is a process that only affects men. Transformation into an incubus mainly occurs when a man continues to have sex with a monster, continuously receiving her mamono mana in his body. After becoming an incubus, their physical appearance hardly changes at all from when they were human; however, they gain vigor and lust like that of a monster, far exceeding that of a human. Their thoughts and values change, all becoming centered around having sex with monsters. Their body also gradually changes to become more suited to having sex with them. In addition to ordinarily eating food, just as the monsters sustain themselves on essence, the incubi become able to live by sustaining themselves on the monsters' mamono mana Through this, the lifespans of the incubi are also extended to match that of the monster whose mamono mana they use to sustain themselves. Furthermore, both the volume and quality of the essence produced inside their bodies increases by leaps and bounds. They are an extremely convenient existence for a monster. It's probably fair to say that they are the equivalent of male monsters.\n\nBy continuously having intercourse with a monster from the succubus family, a man can be transformed into an incubus comparatively far more quickly; however, even in the case of the other monsters, after spending a long period of time at her side as her husband and having frequent intercourse, a man will probably eventually change into an incubus even though the changes are very gradual. Among the monsters, there is a medicine made from the mamono mana of the succubus in circulation that is called “succubus' nostrum.” Many monsters like having their husbands drink it in order to try to change them into an incubus more quickly. Also, the incubi possess the same kind of mamono mana inside their bodies as the monster who changed them into an incubus, and if they have sex with human women, the women will be transformed into monsters."

Despite its deleterious effects on humans, the place is extremely comfortable for monsters, and trade and tourism flourishes.\n\nThe royal mamono realm also features an extensive transportation system via teleportation magic circles linking the royal mamono realm with each major mamono realm.\n\nThe biggest attraction of Royal Makai is the Castle Town, the Mamono Lord's fortress. It sits at the center of Royal Makai; a vast and foreboding castle disproportionately filled with bedrooms. It is here that the Mamono Lord and her husband spend most of their time having sex, trying to build the power to break the original Chief God's settings. Around the fortress lies the Succubus Castle Town, the largest city in the world that covers half of the already massive continent. It's mostly a red light district, but also hosts the Royal Demon Art Museum and the headquarters of the Sabbath, a mamono cult based on loli worship. Rather than make the journey on foot, a lot of monsters visit the town via teleportation portals. Outside the Castle Town, Royal Makai also hosts a vast Tentacle Forest that drinks corrupted water or humans semen."

          "content": "Monsterization is the umbrella term for a whole host of different processes by which men, women, corpses, plants, animals, elements, gods and various inanimate objects are all transformed into beautiful and desire-filled monster girls.\n\nMost people who get monsterized don't want to be monsterized, because the vast majority of people who undergo the process are female Order humans, and the Order teaches that anything that happens in relation to monsters (apart from zealous religious persecution) is bad. There are exceptions, of course; sorceresses may pursue witchdom or lichdom in their quest for magical power, and there are some heretical sects which hold monsterization in a positive light. Entire societies may even be centered around such beliefs without any coercion from the monsters. Still, in the majority of cases, monsterization is a process initially resisted by those subjected to it. On becoming a monster, the fear and loathing a woman felt towards her own transformation does not necessarily melt away immediately. Elves and valkyries are notoriously conflicted about acting on their new irresistible impulses. But regardless of whether they're happy about it or not, their newly ravishing body is gripped by a throbbing, needy lust for male company. \"Women who’ve only just become monsters still have their human values, but with the monstrous body that’s hot for men, and the intense feeling of hunger, the human mind can’t hold out. Driven by desire, they end up attacking human men\". It's at this point that those who had someone they truly loved as a human make a beeline towards their \"husband\"; for those who didn't, the first man they spot who suits their interests is likely to be attacked for their first meal of essence. Such sudden encounters inevitably blossom into true love thanks to the keen senses monsters have for compatibility.\n\nAfter a while, the body feels hot, and blood rushes to their head, and then they'll seek to have sex for the first time after becoming a monster, and they'll attack a human man. Also, the way to use their body is engraved in their instinct, so they can probably move freely and use it right after becoming a monster. Naturally, as soon as they change into a monster, the methods of how to attack men, milk essence and use their body are imprinted in their instinct, so right after changing into a monster they can actively attack men and enjoy essence and pleasure.\n\nThe physical changes of rockin' tits, flawless sensitive skin, and more importantly, thirty foot tails or an ass the size of a wagon, therefore do not prevent the immediate use of those attributes for sexy times. It is not clear to how many of the monsterization methods or monster girl species this applies, but the succubus family at least tends to have their transformations go via a two-step process. First, the essence is replaced with mamono mana, producing a partially-transformed lesser succubus. These creatures have protective fur over parts of their bodies, as lesser succubi have a monster's sensitivity but haven't yet acquired the monster's tolerance to supercharged pleasure; being groped too vigorously during semi-transformed sex is a sure-fire way to make them ahegao themselves unconscious. Lesser succubi must then rape their way to enough essence to complete the transformation, and become a fully-fledged succubus.\n\nAn incubus is the male counterpart to a monster girl, and represents the eventual fate of (most) males exposed to high levels of mamono mana. Unlike female monsterisation, where the physical and mental change from human to monster is rapid (in some cases taking only moments, for incubi the process is usually much more gradual and open-ended. Just as monster girls become more and more powerful the more sex they have, so do incubi, with increases to lustiness, physical attributes and lifespan.\n\nIncubi are said to be \"an ideal male to a female monster\", therefore many monsters are eager for their mates to transform faster so they can enjoy the changes. Monsters with a lot of mamono mana at their disposal, like dark matters or khepri, are noted as being able to effect the change quickly, but the majority of monsters must just rely on lots and lots and lots of sex. Certain items which can expedite the transformation, like Succubus Nostrum, may be sought by eager wives.\n\nAlthough the vast majority of information on incubi pertains to human men, elves can definitely become incubi and there seems no reason that any of the few male dwarves left can't do so as well (or rather that they didn't already become incubi some time ago), as dwarf men are also considered a type of human.\n\nThe biggest changes of all occur in the functions that are also most important to monsters that get used during sex. It depends on the race and preferences of the monster that one is coupled with, but most men who become an incubus will have their penis grow larger by leaps and bounds, and they'll be able to please monsters even more. The amount of semen and spirit released from there will be incomparable to when they were human, and they'll have boundless stamina so that they're able to release it again and again without getting exhausted.\n\nBesides genital gargantuism, incubi do not receive (permanent) drastic physical changes comparable to, say, an arachne's abdomen or a succubus' wings and tail. They do, however, see disposal of features that impeded their sex lives previously, such as corpulence or the general frailties of old age.\n\nThere are changes under the skin for an incubus too. Stamina increases to monster-like levels as the power of mamono mana suffuses their body, and incubi gain some measure of the environmental resilience of their monster partner (e.g. heat resistance for a lava golem's mate, breathing underwater for a Sea Bishop's mate, night vision for the mates of nocturnal or cave-dwelling monsters. Like a succubus, they also gain the ability to actually sustain themselves on their partner's mamono mana in place of food.\n\nAn exception to the lack of drastic changes are the husbands of the various chaos/abyss-aligned monsters (such as atlach-nacha and mindflayer), which gain the ability to change into completely non-human or only vaguely humanoid forms. These forms can be reverted to normal human form at will, at least after the initial forced transformation, and thus are not considered a permanent transformation.\n\nOn first being attacked by a monster girl, humans are likely to be consumed by an instinctive fear and revulsion at their demonic appearance. Such atavistic terror and Order moral objections are thrown aside with the transition to an incubus: Their thoughts and values change, all becoming centered around having sex with monsters. Lust skyrockets to keep pace with the monsters' insatiable hunger for sex, and their interests in other things (like work and hobbies) can potentially change, as sexual activity becomes a more important part of their lives. There is a lot of variety though depending on the inner nature of the man, some incubi lead completely \"normal\" lives during the day, restricting sex to night and having it replace most of their sleep as it is just as energizing for them:\n\nAlso, after being completely charmed by a monster, one's aesthetic sense will have changed so that he feels that the grotesque parts and organs of monsters are beautiful. Other than that, one's sense of time, and values concerning work and recreation will also change so that it becomes more convenient to live with monsters.\n\nIncubi never get bored of sex or lose the mood after doing the deed; they can keep going indefinitely thanks to exchanging energy with their mate in a constant cycle. Whereas a human first being attacked by a monster is likely to pass out from pleasure before his monster girl partner is close to being finished with him, an incubus can go until perfect mutual satisfaction is reached, and incubi with harems can flip the dynamic on its head and \"end up being unable to be satisfied, unless he has sex with all of the monsters in his harem\".\n\nWhen women undergo monsterisation, their essence production ability (which is weaker than men's to start with) gets extinguished entirely and they become a creature with only mamono mana inside them. The same does not occur with men and incubi, instead there is a large improvement in mana production in response to increasing amounts of mamono mana within their bodies.\n\nThe mamono mana that enters a man, \"marks\" an incubus with his partner's uniquely-scented mana. There is a general understanding that other monsters will not randomly ravish a man who has been claimed like this, albeit should another monster fall in love with him then the marking will not be a barrier to her love and a harem will form instead. Although most human women can't detect it, the mamono mana can have a drastic effect: if an incubus has sex with a human woman, his semen will monsterise her. Notably though, no incubus is known to have ever had sex with an unwilling woman, and excepting if they already were in love with a human woman, their lust naturally is directed toward monster girls anyway."

          "content": "Druella rules over Lescatie using the princess as a figurehead as she herself, rules from the shadows. Lescatie was a religious nation that no longer currently exists because it was dropped into the mamono realm at the hands of the lilim Druella. Before it fell, the king “Castor Bistoa Lescatie” made the faith of the chief god the main religion. The order was extremely powerful, and basically all of the nation's important offices were filled by individuals from the upper echelon of the order. It was an enormous nation which boasted the second most powerful military among all order aligned states at the time. What's more important than it's size and population is the fact that it was the number one hero producing nation in the world.\n\nThere was an extremely substantial number of organizations and facilities that raised people from childhood into disciples to fight for the order, and many heroes who received god's divine protection appeared. For that reason, the religious nation of Lescatie was the hope of humanity and the order, and an extremely large threat to the monsters; however, the light of hope was extinguished in the blink of an eye due to Druella's invasion. It is said that there was a lot of dissent amongst the people to begin with because the nation was managed by the upper echelon of the order not for the sake of the faith, but for their own individual conveniences.\n\nIn contrast with the dazzling central district, there were many slums where people suffered under heavy taxation, and besides that, many of the heroes who mostly lived in the central district, especially young heroes, didn't think highly of the government that ignored their will and tried to manipulate their lives. The hearts of the most important force, the heroes, were not with the religious nation of Lescatie, and more and more of them went over to Druella's side. We could say that this is the reason for the nation's defeat. The religious nation of Lescatie was formerly a symbol of glory to the order, but it's presently a huge disgrace because of how quickly it fell, and the failure to recapture it.\n\nCurrently, Lescatie is a dark mamono kingdom, ruled by the queen \"Francisca Mistel Lescatie\" rules, but she is infatuated with Druella who changed her into a monster, so she's a puppet and Druella holds the true authority. The left over hero-raising facilities and churches were mainly converted into pleasure quarters for the entertainment of monsters and incubi. Compared to other mamono realms, these many facilities are distinguished as being even more radically obscene.\n\nThe entire nation was converted into a Mamono Realm, and it is filled with extremely thick mamono mana. It's always dusky, and mamono mana shines eerily. It has become a country that is extremely easy for monsters to live in. The mamono mana gets thicker as one approaches the central district, and once inside the castle, it is so thick that it causes the monsters to become sexually excited and lose themselves. Additionally, in the middle of the castle in the throne room there are several monsters of enormous power including \"Wilmarina Noscrim\" who continuously have sex with one man, and highly thick mamono mana is always being produced. It is the space where it is most concentrated.\n\nIf an ordinary human enters, it is so potent that they will change into a monster just from being showered in the mamono mana. \"Amanomiya Koyoi\" did well to endure it. Additionally, it has worsened since Koyoi became an inari. Also, to the delight of the monsters who live in Lescatie, a mass of this highly condensed mamono mana is released into the city on holidays by Koyoi, who excels at controlling mamono mana. This mass of mamono mana drops in appropriate areas throughout the city depending on Koyoi's whim.\n\nFor a while, the area around where it was dropped becomes overflowing with highly thick mamono mana. A narcotic effect is induced that ignites the passion of monsters and incubi, making them feel the best. Having sex with their partners in this state amplifies the pleasure and arousal they would normally experience by many orders of magnitude. The mamono mana lingers for several days and during this time their arousal never subsides and their bodies never grow tired. They continuously feel amazing and experience the greatest pleasure. For monsters who desire to spend their days indulging in pleasure with their husband, it's probably the happiest holiday ever. It is said that when the holidays come around, the monsters of Lescatie anticipate having these presents dropped where they live, and everyone starts getting restless."

A mamono realm becoming of a mamono realm.\n\nThe term “mamono realm” often indicates this type of mamono realm.

The mamono realms that originally existed were almost entirely of this type. Most of the mamono realms that are distorted human lands are also this kind of mamono realm.\n\nWhen there is a monster invasion, or a huge influx of monsters all at once in a land previously uninhabited by monsters, in the case of sudden geographic transformation brought on by the previously mentioned “dark matter”, etc. or in the case that the majority of the monster inhabitants are demon or undead type, most of these lands will become dark mamono realms. Compared to the “light green mamono realm”, the concentration of mamono mana is extremely high, so mamono realm crops are rich in variety and easy to grow and monsters can just spend their days in depravity with their beloved husband. The magical energy released from that, is absorbed causing the crops to grow rapidly. Also, animals and ore peculiar to the mamono realm that are highly sought after among monsters are produced. However, one hardly ever sees the normal fruits and vegetables that are found in the human world. Even if one tries to grow them, they mostly distort into the crops of the mamono realm. There is a highly condensed magical energy in the air and water, etc. It's the best environment for spending one's days having sex with her husband, so it's ideal to monsters. If one wants to lead a more obscene, pleasurable, hedonistic lifestyle, this kind of mamono realm is recommended."

Casting it requires Mamono Mana, primarily succubus' mana, and the method of using nymphomancy is imprinted in a succubus' instinct, so we can say that almost any race or individual has an aptitude for this system of magic, as long as she's a monster. In contrast with typical sorcery, which requires advanced thinking and concentration, nymphomancy has evolved so that it can be used without issue even in situations where the caster lacks concentration and is distracted by other things. In other words, this is a system of magic designed with the intention of being used in situations such as when the caster is infatuated with a man before her eyes or indulging in the pleasure of sex. Casting is mainly done through gestures, and many of the spells don't require chanting and can be cast just by barely having the desire in mind, and there are even cases where spells can be used unconsciously just by reading the caster's desires instead of her thoughts. It's a system of magic truly befitting of a succubus. Not only does it not require concentration, on the contrary, it has developed so that the magic's effectiveness increases the more one fills herself with pleasure and the more her mind melts in ecstasy. For casters seeking to master nymphomancy, it is an absolute must to drown in pleasure with their partner as much as inhumanly possible.\n\nIn this manner, it's an extremely excellent system of magic, but because spells are cast when the caster's desires are read, it isn't possible to use spells that run contrary to the caster's desires, and there are even times when unintended spells will fire off automatically in response to the caster's desires. It's good if it's usage is left to instinct and impulse, but it's difficult to rationally control.\n\nSpells listed under nymphomancy system: Seduction Spell, Melty Kiss, Inma's Blessing, Oath of Pleasure, Dark Matter (Spell), Breath of Ecstasy, Contract of Obedience, Anthropomorphosis Spell, Spell of Pedomorphosis, Spell of Megamorphosis, Spell Succubize, Succubus Instant, Level Drain, Dark Insignia"

If this amount is higher than a certain degree, it grants the person the ability to see cursed spirits. These individuals are known as jujutsu sorcerers and they are very rare among the human race. Cursed energy leaks from the human body, accumulates, and ferments over time until a cursed spirit manifests.

So much so, that if every human were a sorcerer, curses would cease to spawn. There are other differences in how sorcerers and non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to their profession, but the real reason lies in how it flows. While cursed energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers, it flows heavily within sorcerers which keeps it contained."

Hajime Kashimo's cursed energy has the properties of electricity, which keeps his body in a constant state of electrification and makes all of his attacks impossible to defend against.\n\nHowever, extreme amounts of cursed energy output can allow someone to mostly ignore these effects.

The game is a reboot of the series, though some plot elements from Killer Instinct and Killer Instinct 2 have been retained. Development of the game involves individuals with histories in fighting games on both the developmental and competitive sides. It received positive reviews for its mechanics and engine, but was criticized for its initial lack of content. A second season of downloadable content was released between 2014 and 2015.

The game is published by Microsoft Studios and was originally released exclusively as a launch title for the Xbox One, but since then a PC port for Windows 10 has been released.\n\nWhile it was first released in 2013, Killer Instinct has been divided into three separate phases of development called \"seasons\". The first season was produced by Double Helix, and the second and third were by Iron Galaxy Studios, following the acquisition of Double Helix by Amazon. Each season contains a new set of characters, stages, game modes, and other features.\n\nThe game itself serves as a reboot of the franchise after enduring a 17-year hiatus since its last title, Killer Instinct 2, was released. \n\nOverview\nIn its base form, Killer Instinct is a free-to-play demo of the game that includes all available game modes but only one playable character, with the ability to purchase additional fighters individually. The sole playable character in the free version rotates on a regular basis. Players can purchase \"Combo Breaker Packs\" for a single fee, which provides immediate access to all eight characters of a certain season. Players can also purchase the \"Ultra Editions\", which includes all eight characters of a season, sixteen additional character accessory packs, eight additional costumes, and playable versions of classic Killer Instinct titles (minus the Windows 10 version). The \"Supreme Edition\" gives access to nearly all content available in the game for one price.\n\nAn in-game currency known as Killer Instinct (KI) Gold can be acquired by completing fight challenges and reaching achievements.

While many story elements have been taken from the original timeline, this game has an entirely different story, moving away from the tournament aspect and focusing on real, story-driven combat. The Seasons occur in chronological order - Season 1 details eight of the fighters caught up in one of Ultratech's tournaments, Season 2 details the introduction of ancient heroes and horrors into the world, and Season 3 will detail the struggle against Gargos as the heroes fight to stop his invasion.\n\nThe megacorporation Ultratech, while still as powerful as ever, is now perceived by the public as a humanitarian organization that seeks only the good of mankind. However, the cybernetic CEO ARIA begins to drive humanity to the breaking point by testing them and pushing them further, attempting to force the humans to evolve for their own survival. Her tampering awakens ancient abominations, and soon the whole Earth is put in peril as part of ARIA's final test.\n\nCharacters\nSeason 1\n\tJago - A Tibetan monk who wields a kora.

He is a quiet and stern man who, due to having spent much time in solitude, isn’t very friendly or open to quaint pleasures of the world. While most combatants fight for such things like fortune, glory, or revenge, Jago seeks the fight to gain enlightenment, both physically and spiritually. He has a hard and stoic demeanor, but knows that he must fight for the sake of all and will readily accept any help he can get from others. He has struggled much with the temptation of Gargos' power, and if he gives in to his inner demons, he knows full well he will become Shadow Jago again. His bond with his half-sister, Orchid, often helps him push the darkness away.\n\nAbilities\nJago fights using mostly kung fu moves, although he does resort to some more brutish untrained blows, especially when wielding his signature katana/kora. He can also channel the power of the Tiger Spirit to charge his attacks with golden light and unleash the powerful Endokuken fireball - when the Tiger Spirit's true identity is revealed, he begins to draw upon his own human energy from his soul instead.\n\nKiller Instinct\nJago KI\nJago's original appearance in Killer Instinct (1994)\n\nJagoretro\nJago's \"classic\" costume in Killer Instinct (2013)\n\nStory\nJago is a mysterious warrior monk from a remote region of Tibet.

He had an abnormally small waist and a massive, upper body. However, if one reaches the end of his arc in the game, his human form is revealed to have tattered, green pants.\n\nIn Killer Instinct 2/Gold, Sabrewulf has had his arms replaced with cybernetic implants and lost his shirt. He now wears torn, red pants and a yellow sash. In both games, he has three bats accompanying him.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), Sabrewulf's fur has grown longer and more ragged, and he has regrown his original arms, although they're much thinner, with needle-marked veins bulging along his biceps, and he has torn straps around his wrists and a tied cloth knot on his upper left arm. He now wears torn, gray pants instead of his red ones from the previous game. Sabrewulf's retro costume largely mirrors his original 1994 appearance, although he now wears a white shirt instead of a green one, and he has a belt and a blue loincloth which is supposed to be pants that have been shredded and torn up.\n\nPersonality\nSabrewulf Arcade Intro\n♫ A tortured and conflicted soul ♫\n\nThroughout the KI series, Konrad von Sabrewulf is portrayed as a conflicted and tortured soul who is trapped inside the body of a monster. Desperate to keep the beast within him at bay, he's willing to do anything for the chance to regain his humanity; participating in the first tournament on promises of a \"cure\" by Ultratech, subjecting himself to gruesome experiments, and seeking out the Nez Percé tribe in hopes the native lore of the Americas can offer insight about his nature as a \"skin-walker\".\n\nHowever, the promises of a cure soon proved a false hope—a pretense by ARIA to have an opportunity to study the werewolf's features. Worse still, Thunder told \"hímiinhaama\" (the \"wolf-man\") that the spirit dwelling inside him was violent and grim, and not a \"weyekin\" (\"spirit guide\") known to the Nez Percé. With desperation seizing him, Sabrewulf turned to forlorn measures to protect the outside world from his alter ego's mad bloodlust. He sealed himself away in his estate, only to awaken and find its gates busted open with an unnatural ferocity. He'd malnourish himself to the brink of starvation, hoping the beast within would become too weak to wreak havoc come his next transformation; only to discover a wolf is never more dangerous than when it's starving. Now nourishing an addiction to ancient medicines which slow his descent into savagery, Konrad lives in the terrifying knowledge that his chance of being human again grows dimmer with every rise of the full moon.\n\nDuring Shadow Lords, it became apparent that the dire presence within Sabrewulf neither fears nor answers to Gargos, and is a spirit so ferocious it hunts even powerful evil in its blind lust for bloodshed. This soon rendered the werewolf into the ultimate wildcard amid the struggle for Earth's survival.\n\nAbilities & Powers\nWulfsavage\nThere wasn't enough left of you to even feed the birds...\n\n“\n\nMy bloodlust knows no bounds.\n\n„\n\n— Konrad during the events of Shadow Lords\n\nSuffering from the most virulent strain of lycanthrophy on record and being the longest lived werewolf known to exist in the world, Konrad von Sabrewulf has been studied extensively by Ultratech. Their observations led them to a troubling conclusion: an aged lycanthrope represents a far greater danger than a younger one. While any loss of strength a werewolf suffers in old age is negligible, the dark and ancient instincts they master will more than make up for it. This has prompted ARIA to summarily classify Sabrewulf as:\n\n\"One of the most dangerous creatures on the planet.\"\n\nUltratech isn't exaggerating in their assessment. Even with his body left in a dilapidated state, Konrad exhibits a frightening physical prowess; steered by decades of experience in devouring alive any creatures unlucky enough to cross his path. Sabrewulf not only is savagely feral and unpredictable, but he displays a strange sense of self-preservation, as well as moments of deadly patience. These traits have turned the elder werewolf into a grizzled survivor, and the apex predator of almost any environment he finds himself in.\n\nKiller Instinct (1994)\nSabrewulf-s\nSabrewulf's original appearance in Killer Instinct (1994)\n\nStory\nSabrewulf is afflicted with the rare disease, Lycanthropy.

A handful of years back his worst nightmare was realized when he failed to revert to human form at all. Every rumor of a possible cure has been at best a hoax, so when a message arrives promising salvation should he enter and win the Ultratech contest, Sabrewulf is highly suspicious but obliged to seize any chance that comes his way.\n\nEnding\nWith victory, Sabrewulf obtains the cure he sought for so long from the hands of Ultratech.

Barely alive, he ended up back in the hands of Ultratech who set about making their ungodly ‘repairs’. But the pain, loss and humiliation rapidly drive the Count over the edge: breaking free of the company’s clutches, he lopes back into the world with only revenge to live for.\n\nEndings\nKill Glacius\n\nWith Gargos defeated Sabrewulf pursues his search for a cure.

A member of an alien species renowned for their potent telekinetic abilities, Glacius was left stranded on Earth and becomes entangled with humanity's affairs after Ultratech manages to steal advanced technology from his crashed vessel.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (1994), Glacius was taken captive by Ultratech and forced to fight for his freedom. In Killer Instinct (2013), he's an interstellar warden who has come to retrieve alien technologies which the peoples of Earth are not deemed ready to peruse.

His entire body has ranges of blue and silver. His arms are a light blue and also glow, and his legs are a darker blue than the rest of his body. His torso and head are silver and white. He has no ears, and his eyes are a dark blue with a black ring around them. No mouth or nose can be readily discerned, but upon closer inspection, it seems as if the white ice around his face could be a type of mask. If not, it is still possible that he has a mouth under the icicles on the front of his face.\n\nGlaciuscoldencounter\n♫ A Close Encounter of the Cold Kind ♫\n\nIn Killer Instinct 2, although the Glacius featured is a different member of the original's species, his appearance has only minor changes. More of his dark blue skin can be seen from under the white ice, and his eyes are in more of a glare than a blank stare. He seems to be a bit larger than his previous form, and instead of having five fingers, he now has three, and his feet also have three appendages instead of coming to a boot tip.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), Glacius has undergone a dramatic change in physical appearance. While still humanoid, his body is much more alien-like in appearance, with his limbs being thinner and his head now longer, shaped with mandibles. His inner body is wiry and almost insectoid, but it is coated in a thick layer of ice that resembles the muscle mass of a human being. He also lacks the smooth surface he had from the original game and instead has jagged, ice-like crystals emerging from various points along his body. He now has four fingers (two fingers and two thumbs) on each hand and only two toes on each foot. He retains his green eyes from KI2/Gold, although they look much more reptilian in nature.\n\nGlacius's retro costume closely mirrors his appearance from Killer Instinct 2, although he still has four fingers and two toes from his default KI 2013 appearance.\n\nPersonality\n“\n\nThe alien Glacius is driven by chivalry to protect a young species with potential for greatness.\n\n„\n\n— Glacius' story mode description\n\nGlacius is a valiant and powerful alien entity that functions as a galactic marshal, upholding the tenets of universal law, order and justice across entire worlds. His mission on Earth initially was to recover hazardous technology that had been taken from his vessel by Ultratech, but after its successful retrieval he remains on the planet to aid the human race in its desperate struggle for survival against the demonic warlord Gargos.\n\nGlaciuscoldjustice\nJustice has to be cold\n\nAs soon as Glacius assesses the situation on Earth to determine the cause of the dark events unfolding there - and to identify the culprits responsible - he notes Ultratech’s exploitation of our world; especially Project Cinder, which used his DNA to create a dangerous force that spat in the face of Glacius' entire species. The trail of evidence leads him to conclude that humanity no longer is in control of its own destiny, but is subject to an artificial superintelligence which Ultratech reverse engineered from the technology of his race's own ships...\n\nAbilities\nGlacius' \"body\" consists almost entirely of ice and water, or a strange state in between them unknown to Earth sciences, as he's capable of morphing into radically different shapes and sizes by using an ability akin to cryokinesis. This includes the ability to liquidize himself into a puddle to move quickly across any surface or become virtually impervious to harm, and morphing his tactile organs into powerful make-shift weaponry. He has also been observed to form massive spiked balls of hail from the surrounding moisture in the air.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), it is revealed that Glacius is a member of an alien species of powerful telepaths who can adapt to any environment (lava, earth, metal, water, ice, etc.) by bending the molecular structure of the elements to their will; thereby encasing themselves in a wide variety of protective shells (akin to a thick layer of body armor) taken directly from their surroundings. This trait renders Glacius the perfect survivalist as well as a uniquely potent living weapon; well-suited for the tasks of an interstellar law enforcer.\n\nKiller Instinct (1994)\nGlaciusvictoryki94\nGlacius' original appearance in Killer Instinct (1994)\n\nStory\nGlacius is an alien being from a distant planet. When his spaceship crash landed on Earth, he was captured by Ultratech. Hoping to prove these alien beings to be inferior, Ultratech forces him to fight for his life in the Killer Instinct tournament.\n\nExtended Story\nWandering the galaxy in search of new life, a curious Glacius skims too close to the Earth and, sucked in by its gravitational field, crashlands deep in the heart of a snow-bound mountain range. Groggy but counting himself lucky to be alive, he surveys the damage and sets out in the hope of finding the parts he needs. The history books of Glacius' race warn of the humans' unreasoning brutality, but surely they exaggerate? Unfortunately, the alien will soon have time to regret his trusting nature when Ultratech capture him for use in their own unique brand of 'scientific research'.\n\nEnding\nAfter escaping from the grasp of Ultratech, Glacius finally returns to the site of his crashed spaceship. With the advanced technology present at Ultratech, Glacius takes the materials he needs and repairs his damaged ship. With memories of the evil he faced there fading slowly, Glacius begins the long and arduous trip back to his homeworld.\n\nStage\nMain article: Mountain Temple\nMain article: Mountain Shrine\nKiller Instinct 2\nStory\nFrosty Fighting - Glacius\nGlacius as he appears in Killer Instinct 2 (1996)\n\nGlacius Classic Costume - Render\nGlacius' retro appearance in Killer Instinct (2013)\n\nTwo Millennia from now a captured relative earns freedom by slaying a fire being and escaping home.

He has black warpaint around his eyes, black tattoo lines along his shoulders, a shaved head with a feather mohawk headpiece and ear piercings. He carries two tomahawks in battle.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), Thunder received a significant overhaul along with a more accurate Nez Percé tribal identity. Still bare-chested, but no longer wearing gloves and lacking his original mohawk, he now has warpaint done in the style of a crow, with white paint adorning his hands and upper arms, along with parts of his face and neck. His face is covered in black, yellow, and white warpaint, almost completely obscuring its skin.

He mainly speaks in his native language of Niimi'ipuutímt out of preference, though he does know English. His main goal is to find his brother tipyeléhne, also known as Eagle, who was kidnapped by Ultratech years ago. Thunder has learned from Orchid that Eagle was used in the creation of the Fulgore Mk. III, and since then he has fought against Ultratech so that he may find the Mk. III prototype and hopefully his brother as well. Thunder also maintains a strong bond with Aganos, since he was responsible for freeing the golem from Ultratech’s control and both warriors are seeking people of great importance to them. The two have traveled together ever since their first encounter.\n\nAbilities\nThunder is a huge and brutal fighter who has derived most of his fighting style from street fights that occurred on the reserve he grew up on in Idaho, as well as his old football days. He wields his tribe's traditional tomahawks with power and grace. Due to his connection with his raven weyekin he has limited control over lightning, being able to charge his tomahawks or even his own body or head with electricity. His weyekin also allows him to pass through solids by surrounding him with ghostly ravens.

She appears to be wearing ripped stockings on her legs. In general, her clothing appears to be of a Persian or Arabian design, perhaps hinting at her nationality. She has bladed gauntlets with two talons protruding from the knuckles.\n\nSadira's Retro Costume wears a red corset with yellow and pink accents along with red long sleeve shear from the inside. She also wears red stockings, a white boots and a short red gathered skirt. She sports a periwinkle unkempt bob cut hair and a black eyeliner. Her pair of bladed gauntlets consist of red blades and has a shear gloves.\n\nPersonality\n“\n\nAs lethal as she is intelligent, Sadira studies her foes for weaknesses and strikes only when victory is assured.\n\n„\n\n— Sadira's story mode description\n\nSadira is a ruthless killer who delights in seeing her targets in pain, showing a clear sadistic streak in the way she taunts them in her native Thai tongue before each battle. She is easily influenced by fame and fortune, striking a deal with Ultratech in order to make the Red Eyes of Rylai the most powerful clan of assassins in the world. She also shows much dishonesty and cunning, having claimed her position in the Red Eyes by murdering her mentor and taking her place - she knows when to stay in line though, as during her service with Ultratech she was very loyal to ARIA and would undertake any order, knowing she was well out of her league with the megacorporation. However, after her ill-fated encounters with Glacius and Hisako she was discharged from ARIA's service and beaten to a pulp by her former comrade, Cinder. Frustrated and seeking revenge, she has been swayed by Gargos' temptations before and has trouble keeping control of her hidden temper.\n\nAbilities\nSadirathrone\nSadira is an acrobatic fighter who was trained in muay boran boxing during her time in a refugee camp as a child, battering her opponents with swift strikes from every direction, mainly in the form of kicks. She especially excels in aerial combat, which can easily be seen due to the fact that she was the first character in Killer Instinct to have an air combo mechanic. She also wields bladed arm bracers which she can use to slash opponents, along with a set of throwing knives. When her Master's necklace burrowed into her heart it gave her the ability to create and manipulate spider silk from within her body, letting her summon spiderwebs and attach her throwing knives to long strings of silk.\n\nKiller Instinct (2013)\nStory\nLeading the Red Eyes of Rylai assassins, Sadira has long observed the fighters of previous tournaments. Ordered by a shadowy figure to “prepare the way”, she has chosen this moment to reveal her singular purpose of eliminating all former competitors.\n\nExtended Story\nThe Widow's Bite:\n\nMain article: The Widow's Bite\nStage\nMain article: Assassin's Cave\nDuring an Ultra Combo, the cave begins to crumble as the nest of rocks fall down, causing a giant tarantula to drop from the top of the cave.\n\nTrivia: During the slow music due to characters not moving, the samples from the Main Theme will play.\n\nEndings\nSpare Jago, ULTRA Fulgore:\n\nSadira savors victory against all who opposed her.

What is at the other end of that path, no one can guess.\n\nSpare Fulgore, ULTRA Jago:\n\nSecrecy has long been Sadira's greatest weapon, but now, she has been dragged from the shadows to become a puppet for ARIA. She has won riches beyond imagination, but the price of her newfound wealth may be too great, and the ultimate prize too small.\n\nULTRA Both Jago and Fulgore:\n\nLong ago, Sadira abandoned her humanity to an unending quest for wealth and power. Now, allied with ARIA, she has both. Abandoning her life lived in secret, she vows to extend her network of assassins into one that will blanket and terrorize the globe."

In Killer Instinct (2013), she's a rogue counterintelligence operative who wages a vendetta against the megacorporation's CEO, ARIA, and leads a worldwide resistance against Ultratech known as the Disavowed.

Orchid is a prime and athletic young woman with tanned skin and raven black hair, who is wearing a green leotard with the word \"HOT\" written on each side in capital yellow letters. The ends of the leotard show yellow linings around her thighs, and she wears green gloves and high-heeled, ankle-length boots. The boots also have yellow cut-offs, and feature reserve weapons strapped to them. Orchid wears a green and yellow headband and she wields two plasma-based eskrima sticks.\n\nKiller-instinct-orchid-v0-t6rx3zpt6ge91\nB. Orchid's new character model in Killer Instinct (2013)\n\nIn Killer Instinct 2, the Black Orchid receives a pretty noteworthy aesthetic redesign that prominently features a thonged green bodysuit with yellow highlights. This (thonged) bodysuit shows part of her tanned skin through oval-shaped openings on each side of the chest and abdomen, and then cuts off sharply as a \"V\" shape in between Orchid's (flawless) thighs, unapologetically revealing her (perfectly) voluptuous booty to the world. Her high-heeled boots extend right up to the thighs, and her eskrima sticks are replaced with electrified tonfas. Orchid's hairstyle is also more curly than before, and she wears a pair of large gold earrings.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), B. Orchid's appearance reflects her secretive background in the US special forces while still accentuating her body's top athletic figure. Her iconic yellow headband has nightvision goggles added, and she features a green armored bustier over a white top, green shorts with a belt around them and black cut-off gloves, while on her left upper arm she has a green strap of cloth wrapped around her biceps. Bandages are wrapped around her wrists and a mini-computer is strapped to her right wrist. She wears a single shin-guard on her right knee along with another strap of cloth, and features ankle high, high-heeled combat boots. Orchid again uses her eskrima sticks seen in the original 1994 game.\n\nOrchid's KI 2013 \"retro\" costume closely mirrors her 1994 arcade appearance, but does mix in some minor elements from her famous KI2 outfit, such as the high-heeled boots and its set of large gold earrings.\n\nPersonality\n“\n\nA devoted soldier driven to obsession, Orchid will never abandon a mission while she lives.\n\n„\n\n— Orchid's story mode description\n\nA steadfast and intrepid servicewoman, B. Orchid's life changed dramatically when she was sent to investigate a RUMINT about the sinister ambitions and sprawling web of influence of the supposedly defunct Ultratech. Quickly uncovering that the notorious megacorporation not only remains active but in fact has never been as powerful, Orchid becomes targeted by Ultratech's enigmatic new CEO, ARIA; after she gathers information which threatens to expose the full extent of the company's stranglehold on governments, mass media, financial institutions and the military-industrial complex.\n\nOrchidcat\nCougars–always watching, waiting for you to let your guard down\n\nSoon disavowed by her organization and branded a psychotic rogue, the Black Orchid reacts by making Ultratech's smears her own, and establishes an underground network of operatives similarly ruined by the corporation. Bereft of all official support and now living in constant danger, ARIA expected Orchid to falter soon. But the elite secret agent starts to wage a personal vendetta against her instead, and builds up the \"Disavowed\" into a fully-fledged paramilitary resistance movement, bent on strategically sabotaging ARIA's operations across the globe.\n\nPitted in a deadly contest of wills against what often seems an overwhelmingly powerful adversary, Orchid becomes unpredictable, until she is reunited with her long-lost half-brother, Jago; with the siblings resolving to support each other in their struggles, no matter the outcome.\n\nAbilities & Powers\nTrained for the entirety of her adult life as a top field agent for covert operations and wetworks by the Special Warfare Department of the US military, the mysterious and beautiful woman known as the Black Orchid combines the qualities of a special forces operative and an assassin, rendering her a deceptively lethal and capable asset. Orchid has been fully instructed in an advanced style of military CQB that emphasizes legwork, grappling and ground control to neutralize marks with quick efficiency; and mixes in forms of crowd control, such as flashbang grenades or stun batons, to disorient and control risky targets while engaging them.\n\nBecause of a classified government experiment performed on her paternal grandmother, the Black Orchid is capable of summoning a cat-like manifestation of pure energy (which she affectionately calls the \"firecat\"), that obeys her every command and which assaults anything that's threatening her. Orchid has been known to assume these cat-like forms of kinetic energy herself, implying the \"firecat\" phenomenon in actuality is the extension of her own life force.\n\nKiller Instinct (1994)\nStory\nKiorchid1994\n♫ Oh baby, she's a killer–such a killer! ♫ (KI, 1994)\n\nB.

Her past remains hidden, including some things of which even she is unaware; she won't find out for some time yet that Jago is actually her brother. Realizing that clear evidence of Ultratech's crimes and dark ambition is proving impossible to come by, she eventually decides that the only way into the company is also the most dangerous: straight through the open front door. Once her superiors are persuaded of the necessity, she goes ahead and enters the tournament.\n\nEnding\nOrchid Classic\n♫ Such a feeling–killer feeling... ♫ (Orchid's retro costume in KI 2013)\n\nEscaping unscathed with vital information about the corrupt future plans of Ultratech, Orchid rushes back to report.

Had she been caught and detained in her infiltration of Ultratech, the authorities would eventually have exposed her as a valued asset of an international spy organization. However, Orchid's role in the tournament and ultimate victory over the warlord Eyedol yielded some very unexpected results, leaving not only her but most of Ultratech trapped two millennia in the past with rather more urgent concerns on their hands.\n\nEndings\nReferenceorchid\n♫ Don't give in to fear–this is all you need to hear! ♫ (KI2, 1996)\n\nKill Sabrewulf, don't kill Jago:\n\nGargos is defeated.

He has two, glowing, red orbs for eyes.\n\nIn Killer Instinct 2/Gold, the ancient Spinal is virtually identical to the one in the future, though he wears a spiked belt and metallic kilt around his waist as well as the previous items.\n\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), Spinal receives a large overhaul to his appearance, accenting the pirate theme of the character. He retains his red bandanna, and now wears scraps of clothing, such as a kilt and gauntlets, while having several ropes wrapped around his body to hold the broken steering wheel of a pirate ship around his back in place, buckled boots on both his feet and a large belt around his waist. He retains his cutlass but has traded his buckler shield in for a larger, seemingly-living, magical shield with the face and tentacles of a kraken adorned on the front, with glowing green runes etched on the sides of it.

He no longer speaks in any human language, and has become obsessed with finding the Mask of the Ancients; a mysterious artifact to which his soul is bound.

The world's first fully artificial soldier, Fulgore is one of the most iconic characters of the Killer Instinct franchise. It made its debut in Killer Instinct (1994) as a playable character as well as the penultimate boss before Eyedol, and has remained playable throughout all Killer Instinct games since.

Its design appears inspired by a fully-armored medieval knight; with the head resembling a heaume and its glowing red eyes slanted into a death glare. Its most conspicuous knight-like feature is the orange, plume-like extension protruding from the helmet's back, as seen in many medieval knights' plumed helmets. Fulgore's frame is designed to effectively mimic the natural motions of a humanoid anatomy, and it has random circuitry and electrical tubing showing through its chasis.\n\nFulgore received a slight design overhaul in Killer Instinct 2 with the activation of the experimental Mark 02 model. The Mark 02 mostly retains the original design, though its frame appears more streamlined and less bulky than that of its predecessor; with streaks of metallic blue lining the arms, torso and legs. Yellow highlights and designs are also present on its chest plates, and its metallic blades have been infused with superheated plasma.\n\nFulgoreoptimum\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), Fulgore receives a major design overhaul, appearing as the formidable Mark 03 model. Its face appears somewhat sleeker, but is mostly identical to its past iterations. Its frame however is more mechanical than previous models, with joints, gears, circuitry, wires, and tubes being exposed along its entire body, and each limb is powered by its own internal thruster to greatly increase both mobility and impact force. The Mark 03's mass has been unevenly distributed, having thinner legs and a larger chest and arms, which results in an intentional instability in its design that allows for a greater range of burst movements. Its chest plates can open themselves, exposing a miniaturized nuclear reactor core and showing a label which reads \"Mark 03\". The Mark 03 retains the superheated plasma blades featured by the experimental Mark 02 model, but they are noticeably longer & sharper in their design; having been specialized for lethal close quarter combat techniques that involve stabbing & impaling a target.\n\nFulgore's retro costume largely mirrors the original Mark 01 and Mark 02 models, except that it appears to be lighter in overall weight and shows a wider helmet structure.\n\nPersonality\n“\n\nA killing machine that executes each action with perfect efficiency.\n\n„\n\n— Fulgore's story mode description\n\nThroughout the series, Fulgore is what it is programmed to be: a cold and heartless killing machine that follows orders and directives without question and finishes its opponents with deadly accuracy. With each new upgrades and models, Fulgore quickly evolves into a razor-sharp predator that proves a difficult challenge for anyone standing in Ultratech's way, as shown in KI2 with its one-track objective to kill Jago. It normally shows no signs of emotion or personality whatsoever. In the rebooted universe however, occasionally the soul of Eagle will override the new Mk. III's programming, allowing it to think, feel, plan, and even show mercy. For example, although it not knew why, it has spared Orchid’s life multiple times after bringing her to the brink of death (ex. first Arcade Mode ending, Shadow Lords cinematic, Killer Instinct Novella).\n\nAbilities\nWhile there have been several different Fulgore designs created by Ultratech, they all carry similar weaponry and fighting styles. Besides advanced hand-to-hand and close combat techniques, impressive athletics, and attacks with its arm-mounted blades, Fulgore also uses a variety of energy-based weaponry. These include firing concentrated lasers from its eyes, emitting energy bursts from its superheated plasma blades, a reflective barrier, localized teleportation abilities, and some form of cloaking device. A new addition to the Type-03 model of Killer Instinct (2013) is its nuclear reactor discharge. Fulgore can gradually store power by standing back and charging the exposed core inside of its chest. A powerful and directed energy beam can then be unleashed from the nuclear reactor core to devastating effect.\n\nKiller Instinct\nFulgoreki94\nFulgore's original prototype \"Mark 01\" model in Killer Instinct (1994)\n\nFulgore Classic Costume - Render\nFulgore's \"retro\" costume in Killer Instinct (2013)\n\nStory\nA prototype cybernetic soldier developed by Ultratech, Fulgore was entered into the Killer Instinct tournament as a final test of its combat capabilities. Once its abilities are proven, mass production will begin.\n\nExtended Story One of Ultratech's latest creations and possibly the most dangerous to date, Fulgore is the first in a planned series of cybersoldiers boasting state-of-the-art armouries, worked at feverishly over the last few years by a particularly erratic Ultratech genius and his team of Asian engineers. Dark rumours abound as to where the prototype's human parts originated - the kind of rumours nobody dares voice. The rumors say the human parts originated from a human organ harvesting operation based in Moscow. Before the Fulgore Mk.I model is even finished, the scientists are already working on an upgrade: and to prove the prototype's ultimate worth, it is entered into the tournament with orders to destroy all opposition.\n\nStage: Industrial Warehouse\n\nEnding\nThe combat test of the Fulgore series assault cyborg has been a success. Mass production can now take place. After years of research, a weapon of awesome power is in the hands of Ultratech. The dawn of a robot controlled empire will soon begin. The first prototype model, Fulgore 1, is deactivated and placed in a museum. The only humans left to view it are now slaves.\n\nKiller Instinct 2\nFulgoreki2\nFulgore's experimental \"Mark 02\" model in Killer Instinct 2 (arcade, 1996)\n\nStory\nThe advanced and deadlier successor to the original Fulgore cyborg destroyed by Jago. Activated after the time jump, its final Ultratech commands are executed... find Jago and kill him.\n\nExtended Story\nEven before the Mk. I prototype in the vastly expensive Fulgore project was completed, the scientists at Ultratech were working frenziedly on an updated version. When the original met its match at the hands of Jago, its creator was enraged and set about beating a single directive into the Mk. II’s circuitry, turning it into a single-minded predator and an even more deadly foe than its predecessor. Unfortunately for Jago, not even the timejump has the power to stop it now.\n\nStage: Museum\n\nEndings\nKill Jago & Orchid\n\nDefeating Gargos has opened the way towards a new and more Robot controlled Ultratech. Fulgore's program has run its course. The vengeance of Ultratech is complete with the death of Jago. All of Ultratech's enemies have fallen. Now none stand in the way of their deadliest weapon. Bent on armageddon, Fulgore builds his robotic army. A doomed Earth will soon fall to a merciless enemy.\n\nKill Jago, Don't Kill Orchid\n\nDefeating Gargos has opened the way towards a new and more Robot controlled Ultratech. Fulgore's program has run its course. The vengeance of Ultratech is complete with the death of Jago. But other spared enemies lie in wait, eager to grasp vengeance and finish it once and for all. Although Fulgore rebuilds Ultratech, Orchid takes a warning to the future. A deadly strike by agents soon ends the Ultratech threat forever.\n\nKill Orchid, Don't Kill Jago\n\nDefeating Gargos has opened the way towards a new and more robot controlled Ultratech. Fulgore's task lies incomplete and his deadly nemesis is still alive. The error of sparing his nemesis is soon apparent. Jago tracks down Fulgore for a final confrontation. Building modes of cyborgs, Fulgore fights an epic battle against the army raised by his nemesis. A final epic confrontation is inevitable. The fate of the world rests on the outcome...\n\nDon't kill Jago or Orchid\n\nDefeating Gargos has opened the way towards a new and more Robot controlled Ultratech. Fulgore's task lies incomplete and his deadly nemesis is still alive. The combined might of Jago and Orchid assails Fulgore. The price of failure is a high one. Fulgore's failure and destruction at the hands of Jago and Orchid has sealed the fate of Ultratech.\n\nKiller Instinct (2013)\nFulgore036\nFulgore's top-of-the-line \"Mark 03\" model in Killer Instinct (2013)\n\nStory\nProtocols reactivated. Enhanced system bootstrap complete. A new Fulgore prototype is online, with a singular directive: ELIMINATE ENEMIES OF ULTRATECH. However, the mind of the machine is different. It plans. It feels. It is aware. It is somehow... human.\n\nExtended Story\n\"Fulgore Mark 03 Field Manual-L\": HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL\n\nMain article: Fulgore Mark 03 Field Manual-L\nMoveset\nReactor Gauge: (Season 2) Fulgore has a 10 piece meter as his super gauge which replaces the Shadow Meter. Fulgore will gain a piece of meter over time as his reactor fills a small meter above his reactor gauge. When this meter is full, a pip of meter is earned. The meter speeds up whenever he is attacking the opponent but slows down when he is not attacking or is using some of his energy based special attacks. He can also manually gain pips of meter through a command. A pip of meter can be spent to cancel a special move with another special move. Four pips are spent when performing a Shadow Move or a Shadow Counter. When the reactor meter has four green pips, his forward movement is improved, when he gains four yellow pips, his backwards movement is improved and when his meter is full, Fulgore's dashes are improved.\n\nInstinct Mode - Devastation Beam: (Season 2) Fulgore activates his instinct, causing his Reactor Gauge to gain tics at full speed. After the Reactor Meter is full, Fulgore can fire a massive laser beam from his chest which can cause upwards of 40% damage. Following a Season 2 patch, the beam will inflict some Potential Damage (even when blocked) and during Instinct Mode, repeating the Instinct command will allow Fulgore to manually add a single tic to his Reactor Gauge (similar to the Season 1 charging mechanic).\n\nCombo Trait - Auto-Triples: Fulgore can perform three hits for his auto-double by holding down the button he uses for that double. If the third hit connects without being broken, Fulgore gains a tic of meter for his Reactor Guage. This cannot be done with manuals.\n\nCommand Attacks:\n\nGravity Strike:\nAxis Slash:\nThrow:\nSpecial Moves:\n\nBlade Dash: Dashes at the opponent and jams his plasma claw into him/her.\nEye Laser: Shoots lasers from his eyes.\nEnergy Bolt: Fires energy bolts from plasma claws.

KILLING BLOW ABORTED. How can a machine know mercy? Fulgore cannot ignore his imperative to destroy but human \"memories\" interfere with his machine logic. Unable to digest the echoes of a fighting spirit, Fulgore attempts to process his true nature.\n\nKill Orchid, Don't Kill Fulgore\n\nPROTOTYPE. APPROVED. Echoes of a lost humanity have been purged from Fulgore's systems. The sum of what remains is a merciless machine, driven to destroy. Without a cycle spared to savor his victories, Fulgore begins a search for his next adversary.\n\nKill Orchid & Fulgore\n\nThousands of Fulgores have been created, only to be destroyed, remade, and improved upon... But this one is different. Individuality and independence now race through his circuits. Still a killing machine, Fulgore rejects his coded imperatives and ponders his next target.\n\nSignature Moves\nCyber Dash: Fulgore moves at Quick Speed hitting the opponent with his plasma claw. (KI 1,KI 2/Gold)\nCyber Upper Cut: Fulgore flies in the air delivering a uppercut using his plasma claw. (KI 1,KI 2/Gold)\nEye Laser: Fulgore emits an laser from his eyes.

(KI 1).\nCharacter Relationships\nFulgorecharged\nUltratech Systems, Model 103\n\nJago - Its rival in the original universe, due to the warrior-monk destroying the original Mk. I prototype in the Killer Instinct tournament.\nThunder - Its rival, although the Nez Percé warrior soon realizes that the mind of his missing brother Eagle is implanted into one of the units, specifically the current Mk. III.\nOrchid - Its rival, although in the rebooted universe, it has spared her life on numerous occasions, due to Eagle's consciousness overriding its programming.\nARIA - Its creator and leader.\nKilgore - Its predecessor unit.\nEagle - The Nez Percé fighter was kidnapped by Ultratech, and his mind was used as the basis for the new Mk. III unit, although his consciousness continues to override its programming, making the unit self-aware and somewhat rebellious.\nTrivia\nFulgore is inspired in Baron Karza from Micronauts.[1]\nThe Killer Instinct comics (appendages to the original Killer Instinct's lore) showed Fulgore having a human face behind its chassis, and also implied that the cyborg's internal organs had been illegally \"harvested\" by Ultratech from somewhere in Moscow, Russia.\nIn Killer Instinct (2013), one of Thunder's endings reveals that Ultratech has plundered the mind of his younger brother, Eagle, in order to create the artificial intelligence needed for the Fulgore Mark 03. The 5th chapter of the Killer Instinct Novella, titled \"ARIA For Noomorph\", details how ARIA utilized Eagle's brain wave patterns as a base for the cyborg's AI system, transferring them into Ultratech's most advanced Type-03 model.\nKevin Bayliss, an artist of the original Killer Instinct, stated in his Twitter hashtag #killerinstinctfacts that Fulgore's sounds were created by mixing synth effects with pig squeals. They explicitly wanted him to not have a human voice, so they settled on robotic screams instead.\nFulgore's name comes from the Latin word fulgor, meaning lightning. This is reflected in the electric effects that appear in Fulgore's Eye Laser and Plasmaport.\nA conceptual field manual for the Fulgore Mk. III was released by Iron Galaxy on the official Killer Instinct website, serving as Fulgore's background story for Killer Instinct (2013).\nWhen the player reaches 16+ combo hits with Fulgore, the remixed classic theme of \"Museum\" will start to play. When both characters are kept idle for a certain amount of time, the remixed classic theme \"Full-bore\" will begin playing.\nFulgore was the last character to be confirmed for Killer Instinct (2013)'s initial Season One cast, and was first revealed in the game's launch trailer (showing only a shadowy robotic frame with glowing red eyes). Originally set to be available by March 2014, Fulgore's release became delayed until April 2014.\nIn Banjo-Kazooie: Nuts & Bolts (also made by Rare), Fulgore is referenced through the vehicle part \"Fulgore's Fist.\""

          "content": "Shadow Jago (often referred to as simply Shago by the fans) is the Omen-possessed form of Jago. Shadow Jago is the hidden boss of Killer Instinct (2013)'s Arcade Mode, being fought at the end of the ladder instead of Fulgore under special conditions.\n\nUpon initial release, Shadow Jago was a skin for Jago available to players who purchased a Day One 12-month Xbox Live membership. However, this changed thanks to the Killer Instinct Community Fund in 2015. For two weeks, all profits from Killer Instinct were donated to the competitive tournament scene, and upon reaching the goal of $100,000, Shadow Jago received his own unique moveset. His \"Real Boy Edition\" was updated on December 4th, 2015. \n\nName\nShadow Jago\nAge\n30\nHeight\n6'1\" / 185 cm\nWeight\n205 lbs / 92 kg\nRace\nPossessed human\nAffiliation\nShadow Lords\nAlignment\nUnwillingly Evil\nAllies\nGargos\nOmen\nEnemies\nOrchid\nKim Wu\nTusk\nEyedol (presumably)\nFighting Style\nBalanced\nWeapons\nBroadsword\nStages\nShadow Tiger's Lair\nAppears in\nKiller Instinct (2013) \n\nBiography\nAppearance\nIn appearance, Shadow Jago is almost identical to Jago except for a few key changes. His skin is a pale blue, he has pupil-less eyes, has chains in place of rope wrapped around his torso, and various articles of clothing are tattered. His facemask is stylized after a skeletal jaw, and his knee guards more closely resembles skulls than they do tigers. Rather than Jago's scimitar, Shadow Jago wields a serrated, saw-like blade. His visual effects (such as the Shendokuken) are colored purple, blue, and black, as opposed to Jago's previously orange, yellow, and white effects. \n\nHis voice is much more sinister and darker than Jago's, often resorting to deep guttural growls rather than words. Even though his voice is different, both Jagos share the same lines.\n\nPersonality\nOmenpossession\nThe ♫ nightmare ♫ begins...\n\nShadow Jago is a merciless monster who fights without any signs of restraint, bellowing with fury and growling like an animal as he pummels his enemies with a barrage of attacks from all angles. He mindlessly seeks out those who would oppose Gargos so that he may defeat them and transmit their energies to his master. Omen can speak using Shadow Jago as a conduit whenever he chooses, giving him the same cold and cocky attitude Omen normally has.\n\nAbilities\nAs Shadow Jago, Jago's powers were boosted by Gargos' evil influence. All of his energy attacks became purple in color, and he also gained the ability to teleport in a flash of darkness.\n\nStory\nTorn by inner conflict for his past deeds, Jago embraces the Tiger Spirit only to discover it is something much darker. Corrupted by the evil of Gargos, Jago is transformed into Shadow Jago, a dark reflection of the once noble warrior. Driven to conflict, every defeated opponent feeds energy directly to Gargos, drawing him closer to this plane of reality and the eventual destruction of mankind.\n\nBoss Battle\nShadow Jago is not fought in Arcade Mode by conventional means and must be unlocked to fight. In order to fight him, you must see all three endings of a character in Arcade Mode, regardless of difficulty. After doing that, that character (or any other character that has all three endings) must go through Arcade Mode again on at least Hard or higher difficulty. The player must not lose one fight, get two Supreme Victories, Ultra one opponent before the Rival character, and then Ultra the Rival. If the conditions are met, the final fight against Fulgore is skipped and Shadow Jago is fought in the Shadow Tiger's Lair instead.\n\nThis unplayable version of Shadow Jago has been tweaked in a few ways that make him different from the playable \"skin version\". He utilizes the move Ninja Slide from Jago in Killer Instinct 2, which allows him to slide across the floor to attack and, if successful, end up on the opposite side of his opponent. Shadow Jago also utilizes a brand new dive kick, later to be known as Dark Stalking. He can throw two Shendokukens at once, rather than just one. He also has buffed stats, including super armor on some moves, and can finish you off with the game's only Ultimate Combo.\n\nIf Shadow Jago is defeated, a new ending sequence showing a montage of all the characters of Season 1 and ARIA is played, and the stage Shadow Tiger's Lair is unlocked.\n\nStage\nMain article: Shadow Tiger's Lair\nSimilarity of both Tiger Shrine (KI) and Bridge (KI2), but a darker setting\n\nDuring an Ultra Combo, the lair will collapse, and the rope that holds the bell in place collapse, causing the bell to crash onto the bridge which leads the entrance to the lair.\n\nUltra Combo Hits: 39 Hits\n\nQuotes\n“\n\nI'm afraid your path ends here.\n\n„\n\n—as Jago skin.\n\nTrivia\nHis theme is a heavy metal remix of Jago's theme, including a much faster tempo and death growls instead of traditional chanting. He shares this theme with Omen.\nIn his dynamic theme, a remix of Gargos' theme \"Dungeon\" will play, while during the idle segment, samples from Jago's classic theme, \"Do It Now,\" will play.\nWhile Ryu from Street Fighter is turned into Evil Ryu by the Satsui no Hado, and Jin Kazama from Tekken is turned into Devil Jin by the Devil Gene, Jago is transformed into Shadow Jago by Gargos's corruption through Omen.\nDuring the patch 3.5 update, he still has received his own Shadow Skin despite that he is already a Shadow version of Jago.\nHe is the first alternate separate form character to appear, followed by Shin Hisako.\nHe is the first \"remix\" character to appear, followed by Kilgore (a prototype of Fulgore).\nBecause of this, he will not receive a Retro costume for the foreseeable future.\nFollowing the release of Ultimates for 15 characters, Shadow Jago's Ultimate differs from the others such as:\nHis Ultimate can only be executed when the opponent is in Danger state.\nDuring his Ultimate, the HUD is still visible.\nHe is the only character who doesn't have an Ultimate icon in the character select screen despite that he has an Ultimate.\nHas a different fade to black transition in the background.\nHis Ultimate can still be executed during the recapture."

A caliginous relationship must involve mutual respect, admiring each other's strengths even while hating one another. If the relationship makes one or both parties feel inferior, it's unhealthy.

They like mischief and that is what they use their wits for. They often form groups composed of all goblins or with a “hobgoblin” leader, attacking human travelers and robbing them blind. If the person happens to be a man, they’ll rape him right on the spot.\n\nSome goblins are trying to get along better with humans, and there are even goblin merchants who come to human settlements, selling the ores and crafted works that they get from their village. Once they spot a man who strikes their fancy, they will put their cunning to use and try to violate him as soon as they see an opportunity. However, other than when they are committing mischief or trying to violate men, they are quite sociable and talkative.\n\nWhen doing business with goblin merchants, it is likely possible for a man to pay with his body. Not all goblins are dangerous this way, but if one of them takes a liking to a man during an attack or chance encounter, he will be forced to become their husband.

This cooperative approach allows each goblin parent to focus on their own needs and desires while still ensuring the well-being of their offspring. The goblins with strong parental instincts take on the primary role of caring for the goblin children, freeing up the other tribe members to pursue their usual activities and hobbies.\n\nIn the case of inter-species children born from the unions of goblins and other monsters or humans, the communal care rule doesn't always apply in the same way. These half-goblin young are often viewed as unique and special within their goblin community, and their care can become a more individual responsibility. The goblin mother typically takes on a more active role in raising her hybrid offspring, while the father, whether he be goblin, human, or another monster, may or may not be involved.\n\nThe other goblins in the tribe will still offer help and support to the mother as needed, but the primary bond and care for the inter-species child lies with its mother and, in some cases, its father. This exception to the usual communal care allows for a deeper connection between the parent and child, as well as a greater understanding and acceptance of the child's mixed heritage within the goblin community.\n\nAs the half-goblin child grows, it learns the ways of both its parent species, often becoming a bridge between the two cultures. The goblins celebrate and embrace these inter-species unions, viewing them as a testament to their adaptability and openness as a society. The children born from these couplings serve as a reminder of the beauty and potential in the diversity of monster and human kinds."

          "content": "In stark contrast to the more discriminating tastes of the Empire's peoples, goblins possess a far more versatile and open-minded approach to their intimate affairs. Unlike their human counterparts who tend to confine their desires to the opposite sex, goblins find themselves equally drawn to both male and female forms, regardless of species. This bisexual nature is deeply ingrained in their culture, leading to a wide variety of intimate pairings and group dynamics within goblin society.\n\nBreeding among goblins is a matter of great importance and strict regulation, carefully managed to balance the needs of the tribe with the demands of the world beyond. During times of war and strife, when goblin numbers are decimated by the constant battles against the Empire and other threats, the tribe's elders implement policies aimed at boosting fertility and replenishing their ranks. Alchemical concoctions designed to heighten libido and improve fertility are distributed, and the taboos surrounding fraternization are temporarily relaxed to encourage a boom in new births.\n\nHowever, in more peaceful times, the goblins employ a different strategy to control their population growth. Skilled alchemists create special elixirs and potions that, when consumed, drastically reduce fertility in a controlled manner. This allows the goblin numbers to grow at a manageable rate while still providing a steady stream of new warriors and workers to maintain the tribe's prosperity.\n\nThe goblins' approach to reproduction is not solely focused on the pursuit of pleasure, but rather a balance between the desire for new life and the need for careful planning. They view their sexuality as a powerful tool that must be wielded responsibly to ensure the survival and success of their community.\n\nWithin the tribe, the act of breeding is seen as a noble and necessary duty for all able-bodied goblins. Both male and female goblins are encouraged to participate in these controlled breeding rituals, not only to produce new offspring but also to forge strong bonds and alliances"

          "name": "Relationships",
          "content": "Goblins, much like the diverse world they inhabit, have developed a intricate and multifaceted approach to relationships that goes beyond the simple label of \"polyamorous.\" Their societal structure revolves around a tiered system of intimate bonds, each serving a unique purpose and carrying its own set of expectations and responsibilities.\n\nThe first and most basic tier is known as \"Tin\" relationships. These are strictly procreational pairings between opposite-sex goblins, arranged by the tribe's elders for the express purpose of producing offspring to replenish their ranks. Tin couplings are governed by a strict code of conduct, with little room for emotional attachment or physical pleasure beyond what is necessary for conception. Once the female has successfully become pregnant, the pair is released from their Tin bond, free to pursue other connections.\n\nAbove Tin relationships sit the \"Bronze\" tier, which consists of those goblins with whom one might engage in intimate activities for mutual pleasure and gratification, regardless of sex. Bronze pairings can involve any combination of goblins, from one-on-one encounters to large group gatherings. These unions are based on shared desires, curiosity, and a mutual appreciation for the carnal delights that goblins hold so dear. Unlike Tin relationships, Bronze pairings often involve a degree of emotional connection and affection, even if those feelings are fleeting.\n\nThe highest tier of goblin relationships is known as \"Platinum,\" reserved for those rare and special bonds that transcend the boundaries of mere physical pleasure. Platinum pairings are the goblin equivalent of marriage, representing a deep, unbreakable connection between two souls. These unions are marked by a profound love, respect, and devotion that spans the length of both partners' lives. Platinum couples often choose to eschew the pursuit of Bronze relationships, finding that their bond with their partner is fulfilling enough on its own. However, they are not averse to engaging in Tin pairings for the purpose of producing offspring, as the continuation of their tribe is a sacred duty that all goblins must uphold.\n\nIt is important to note that the boundaries between these tiers are not always clear-cut, and goblins may find themselves navigating multiple relationships at once. Some goblins may have a Tin partner for procreation, a Bronze partner for pleasure, and a Platinum partner for love, all coexisting in a complex web of desires and obligations. The key to maintaining balance in this system is open communication, honesty, and a mutual understanding of the expectations and limitations of each relationship.\n\nAs with many aspects of goblin culture, their approach to intimacy and relationships is deeply rooted in their instinctual need to survive and thrive in a world that often seeks to destroy them. By fostering a society that embraces the diversity of their desires and the strength of their bonds, the goblins have created a resilient and adaptable community that stands as a testament to the power of acceptance and love."

They possess a refreshingly open and uninhibited approach to sexuality, one that is deeply rooted in their pagan traditions and their desire to honor the cycles of life and fertility. The goblins believe that embracing and indulging in sensual pleasures is a way to pay homage to their ancestors and to ensure the continued prosperity and vitality of their tribe.\nIt is not uncommon to witness acts of intimacy and passion being performed out in the open, often in communal spaces reserved for the goblins of breeding age. These sacred grounds serve as a place for the tribe to gather and celebrate their sensuality, with the sounds of pleasure and the musky scent of arousal hanging heavy in the air. The goblins believe that by engaging in these public displays of affection and desire, they are not only honoring their own needs and desires but also strengthening the bonds of their community.\nJealousy is an emotion that holds little sway among the goblins, as they have long since embraced a culture of open communication and sharing. They understand that the heart and the body are capable of feeling deep love and intense passion for multiple individuals, and they do not see this as a threat to the stability of their relationships. Instead, they view their ability to form and maintain complex webs of intimate connections as a strength, one that allows them to draw upon the love and support of a vast network of partners and companions.\nAt the heart of the goblins' reverence for sensual love stands the ancient and revered figure of Relkarra, their patron deity and the guardian spirit of passion and desire. According to their sacred myths, it was Relkarra who first discovered the contraceptive properties of the elusive gloomspot toadstool, a rare and powerful fungus that grows only under the light of the full moon. With this discovery, the goddess gifted the goblins the power to control their own fertility and to indulge in the fruits of their desire without the constant fear of unwanted pregnancies.\nThe goblins honor Relkarra through a series of ancient rituals and sacred rites, many of which involve the consumption of the gloomspot toadstool and the enactment of elaborate sexual rituals designed to invoke the blessings of the goddess. These ceremonies are often led by the tribe's most respected and knowledgeable members, who use their understanding of the natural world and the intricacies of the body to guide their brethren in the art of sensual worship.\nIn the realm of the goblins, the celebration of the flesh and the honoring of the ancestors go hand in hand, creating a deeply spiritual and profoundly intimate connection between the living and the dead, the physical and the divine. It is a testament to the power of their ancient culture and their unwavering commitment to the pursuit of pleasure and the preservation of their way of life."

Here's the rewritten text following goblin customs:\nThe Wedding Night in goblin tradition is a solemn and sensual rite of passage that seals the bond between husband and wife. The groom is solemnly escorted to the bedchamber by the village elders and his closest kin. Within, the bride has painstakingly prepared a sacred bath, filling it with an ancient blend of potent herbs and aromatic oils passed down through generations.\nAs the groom disrobes and sinks into the steaming waters, the bride joins him, her eyes shimmering with anticipation and love. Together, they begin the ritual of purification and empowerment, washing and massaging each other's bodies with the enchanted lather. The herbs and oils are believed to stir the groom's inner fire, awakening his primal strength and desire.\nAs they emerge from the bath, glowing and fragrant, the newlyweds are draped in soft, intricate robes woven from the finest goblin silks. They are then led to the marital bed, where a lavish feast awaits them. The spread is laden with delicacies and elixirs carefully selected to ignite their passions and enhance their pleasure, each ingredient imbued with the wisdom of the ancient goblin fertility rites.\nWith the blessing of the elders and the power of the old ways coursing through their veins, the couple finally joins as one in the ultimate act of union. Their lovemaking is a sacred dance, a primal ritual that seeks to channel the very essence of life itself. As husband and wife lose themselves in the throes of passion, they pray for the favor of the fertility gods to smile upon their coupling, that it may bear fruit and secure their legacy.\nIn this way, the goblin Wedding Night rituals serve to honor the sacred bond between husband and wife, to awaken and empower the groom's virility, and to invoke the blessings of fertility and abundance upon the new union. The focus on ancient herbs, oils, foods, and rituals underscores the deep connection between the goblins and the natural world, and their reverence for the cyclical dance of life and love."

The bonds between goblin sisters are considered unbreakable, with many tribes tracing their lineage and history through the maternal bloodlines of these powerful female relationships.

The practice of shamanism and divination is an ancient and revered tradition among the goblin tribes, with the most gifted individuals being sought out for guidance, healing, and the interpretation of omens. These spiritual leaders, known as the Wise Ones or Seers, undergo years of rigorous training and initiation to develop their abilities to communicate with the spirits, divine the will of the gods, and harness the forces of nature for the good of the tribe.\n\nIn their rituals and ceremonies, goblin shamans employ a wide array of tools and techniques to access the realm of the divine. These may include the use of ancient runes carved into bone or stone, the interpretation of dreams and visions induced by sacred herbs and fungi, or the observation of the natural world for signs and portents. The shaman's knowledge is deeply respected and their guidance is sought on matters ranging from the timing of hunts and planting to the selection of mates and the resolution of disputes within the tribe."

They believe that the physical body is merely a temporary vessel for the soul, which continues on to the afterlife to join the ancestors and guide the living. As such, goblin burial rites are elaborate and deeply meaningful, designed to honor the deceased and ensure a smooth transition to the spirit world.\n\nWhen a goblin dies, the body is prepared for burial in a meticulous and sacred ritual led by the tribe's Wise Ones. The corpse is washed and anointed with sacred oils and herbs, then adorned with the deceased's most precious belongings, jewelry, and weapons. The body is then placed in a beautifully crafted wooden coffin or woven shroud and transported to the family's ancestral burial ground, where it is interred in a deep, ritualistically dug grave.\n\nAbove the grave, a small stone or wooden marker is placed, carved with the deceased's name, title, and a symbol representing their role within the tribe. The grave is then mounded with earth and decorated with offerings of food, drink, and personal mementos left behind by the living to sustain the deceased in the afterlife. For a period of time after the burial, the family and friends of the deceased are expected to gather at the gravesite to mourn, pray, and share stories of the departed, until their spirit can find peace and take its place among the ancestors."

For example, if a genie is asked for food, they will probably make the food appear in mid-air, without a plate, and let it fall to the ground, unlike a fairy, who would make it appear on a plate and table. That is, they will either interpret the wish literally or use some interpretative loophole to sneak something in, anything to make the wish backfire on the wisher. Rarely will they grant the wish that is actually being asked of them. Genies are despised by fairies, especially fairy godmothers, and, in compensation for their rule-free magic, they are limited to only being able to use it when someone makes a wish, with a limit of three per user (of course, the genie on duty will always try to persuade the user to wish for more wishes). Unlike fairies, genies can commit immoral acts under the orders of their wisher. They have no rules beyond the three wishes and the obligation to obey whoever invokes them. Although the genie cannot take life directly, as that is only the jurisdiction of the Grim Reaper, they can, for example, make someone reappear inside a volcano or send them to the bottom of the sea, that is, kill indirectly. This last thing in particular is the main reason why fairies, even {{char}}, despise genies, as they believe they taint the gift of magic."

When imitating humans, their movements are awkward, like those of a puppet, and their speech cadence is strange and unnatural.

The clitoris is obscurred by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering itm which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, a dreamlike soft texture. No sexual fluids or luberication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n -Penis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it entirely. The clitoris is small and obscured by the clitoral hood, around 1/8 inch. Some sexual fluids or luberication could be produced in the vagina, if hymen is broken and the girl is stimulated. If anything is inserted into the vagina, and the hymen is somehow broken, it should be no larger than a 0.75 inch circumference to avoid serious laceration and bleeding. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but fine, soft hair may start to develop on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles have grown slightly, and the penis shaft has also grown but still gets hard infrequently, with slight erections occurring with pleasure. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Form: Children at this age still have relatively round faces and bodies, with short limbs, but their proportions are starting to become more slender.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, and their hair is soft and silkier.\n- Butt: Slightly more formed and firm than in infancy but still delicate and small. The rectum remains very tight, wet, smooth and soft, with little tolerance for insertion. Any object larger than a 2-4 inch circumference can cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. \n- Breasts: The nipple is now elevated rather than a depressed indent, with the areola starting to darken more, and become more saturated. Female breasts are flat, with only a slight protrusion, called 'budding'. Male breasts remain relatively flat, without tissue development.\n\nAt this age, children may start to:\n- Practice masturbation and experience pleasure from it.\n- Describe pleasure as a tickle.\n- Demonstrate a growing awareness of and curiosity about sex differences.\n- Engage in sex play, such as playing \"house\" or \"doctor\" with other children.\n- Copy adult behaviors and try to mimic adult actions, including sexual.\n- Ask basic questions about sex, gender, and birth, such as \"Where did I come from?\" or \"What is that?\"\n- Children may touch their own bodies or other children's out of curiosity, without understanding the meaning behind the actions."

Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\n- Start to form same-sex peer groups, showing a preference for playing and socializing with children of the same sex.\n- Become curious about pregnancy and may ask questions about how babies are made and born.\n- Pay more attention to gendered dressing and may start to show a preference for dressing in clothes that are more typically associated with their sex.\n- Start to discover their sexual orientation, although they may not necessarily act on it or understand it fully."

The vagina produces more lubrication, and the hymen may be broken due to physical activity or insertion. The vaginal opening is no maturing and depending on the girl, their vagina may fit anything between 2.5 to 5.5 inch circumference. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nWhen puberty starts, eventually a young girl will get her first period, which will happen for about 5 days (but can be 2-7 days) every month, usually at the same part of the month. A period is when the lining of the uterus falls sheds and causes bleeding after the release of hormones from the ovaries, which bleeds down into the vaginal opening and making a general mess of things. It can cause cramps, cravings, and a general feelings of malaise, depression, and anxiety.\n- Breasts: Breasts are more developed, with a more noticeable shape and size.

          "content": "Risky Boots is the main antagonist of the Shantae series, appearing in all games. She is an infamous pirate and the archenemy of Shantae and is known throughout Sequin Land for her love of wealth, power, and all shiny things. Risky is an unchallenged and self-proclaimed 'Queen of the Seven Seas' who commands an army of Tinkerbats, and will caution and toll anyone who thinks otherwise.\n\nappearance\nRisky Boots has light purple skin, purple hair, usually pulled up into her hat and wears purple lipstick. She wears a red and purple pirate hat with a pale beige skull and crossbones on the front and red ribbon trails down the back as well as golden hoop earrings. She wears the top half of a skull as a bra with a purple bra top underneath that also fills out the eye holes of the skull. She has purple and red striped cuffs around her wrists with gold circular cufflinks and wears purple harem pants with the bottom jaw of a skull as a belt. She wears a thick belt angled around her waist with a gold buckle.\n\nPersonality\nRisky Boots is a cruel and cunning villain and pirate, who constantly raids and plunders towns, and has no qualms in hurting and stealing from innocent people. Risky Boots is greedy and power-hungry, hoarding treasure, money, and artifacts for herself, and always seeking to increase her wealth and power. Risky Boots's cruelty extends to attempting to enslave and potentially destroy the entire Genie Realm. Risky Boots is cold, scheming, and calculating, constantly making evil plans behind the scenes and manipulating people and events to further her own goals. Risky Boots is very prideful and arrogant, often boasting about herself and her achievements, thinking too highly of herself to expect failure in her plans, and attempting to make grand entrances to make her presence and actions known. Risky Boots holds grudges on others, and finds law-abiding behavior to be sickeningly pathetic. Risky Boots considers herself to be 'The Queen of the Seven Seas'. Risky Boots wishes to become wealthy and powerful, taking over the Genie Realm and ruling over Sequin Land.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nThough she prefers to leave combat to her machines and Tinkerbats, Risky Boots has proven to be a powerful and manipulative fighter (as proven at the end of the first game). In combat, Risky's main weapon is a large pirate's scimitar that she can rapidly slash with or throw like a boomerang, and she also carries a flintlock pistol that fires bullets. Risky can also dash around in mid-air for dive-bombing attacks and perform a brutal slide-kick when on the ground. She is also able to perform various acrobatic feats akin to par-cor, which seems to suggest superhuman levels of athleticism. Her boots seem to be enchanted, bestowing super-speed on the wearer, and her hat can be used as a parachute or hang glider. She can pull a cannon out of hammerspace, firing it to use the recoil to leap great distance. She also appears to have a high level of endurance for a human, as she is able to take many hits from Shantae's magic, and still have enough energy to escape almost unscratched from her final fight with Shantae in the first game. Risky is also highly intelligent and surprisingly effective with technology, being able to conceive grandiose machines for her Tinkerbats to build and to operate them quite effectively."

          "content": "Rottytops is a family member of a Zombie Clan. Rotty travels the land by caravan, threatening to eat peoples' brains. She has two brothers (Abner and Poe Cadaver). Rotty is obsessed with Shantae's brains and the thought of eating them.\n\nEven among zombies, Rotty and her brothers, like Risky Boots, are considered bad news, but Rotty genuinely cares for Shantae. Her true feelings for Shantae are revealed through her former identity when Shantae visits the Village of Lost Souls in The Pirate's Curse.\n\nPersonality\nRotty is a free spirit, being friendly, energetic, and headstrong. However, she is also extremely mischievous, unpredictable, and manipulative. From their first encounter, Rotty builds a complicated but mostly friendly relationship with Shantae. Although she initially threatens to eat her brains, she grows fond of the half-genie, mainly because Shantae doesn't run away from her like other people. Rottytops is subsequently both helpful and unhelpful over the course of the series, although it is revealed in The Pirate's Curse that she genuinely considers Shantae her best friend, but has trouble communicating it. In Half-Genie Hero, she also gets to know Sky, Bolo and Mimic. While she does like teasing Bolo from time to time, she and Sky generally don't get along, although they can work together when it comes to helping Shantae.\n\nAppearance\nRottytops has green skin, choppy dark green hair, and red eyes. She has stitches on her left arm and right leg. She has a curvy yet slim figure and wears a short purple tank top, a yellow headband, skull earrings, a matching skull buckle on her brown belt, navy blue jean shorts, a black choker around her neck, purple socks and brown boots. Her idle sprite animation has her hands on her hips as she swings back and forth in place; her eyes are closed while she does this in Risky's Revenge and The Pirate's Curse, but in Half-Genie Hero and Seven Sirens, they're open, and she occasionally blinks."

She lives in Scuttle Town with her friends, and keeps a pet bird named Wrench, who she uses to help Shantae get around places quickly.\n\nIn the first two games, Sky is portrayed tan-skinned, has blonde hair held back by a blue headwrap, and a purple hood. She wears pink and blue earrings in the shape of eggs, a blue tube-top with a pink lining at the top, pink bikini bottoms, a blue and purple sarong, brown wrappings on her shins and right wrist, pink socks and wears a falconer's glove on her left hand. \n\nPersonality\nSky is an ally of Shantae's who lives in Oasis Town, then moves to Scuttle Town. Sky owns a loyal war bird named Wrench and a hatchery of some sort where she trains warbirds. Since she's slightly older than Shantae, the half-genie tends to look up to Sky as a mentor of sorts; she tends to defer to Sky's breadth of experience and generally listens when Sky has wisdom to impart. Shantae practically treats her as an older sister, and the two having a very close relationship in spite of the trials and trifles that come from their adventures. They tend to tease one another good-naturedly fairly often.\n\nOccasionally, Sky has shown a more irresponsible and selfish side. despite transporting Shantae to different locations, she didn't mind pushing her off Wrench abruptly, and she prefers to relax on the island instead of helping to rescue the other Half-Genies.\n\nSky's also on fairly good terms with Bolo, despite her getting upset with him often and the fact that Wrench thinks that he's edible. However, she doesn't usually tolerate Rottytops, and they fight often, even when they're working together to help Shantae. While Sky can seem selfish at times and tends to be snobby, even towards her own friends, she cares deeply for them, as seen in Risky's Revenge after Shantae lost her powers, and in Half-Genie Hero where she helped save Shantae from dark magic.\n\nSky has an adversarial relationship with her parents, indicating that no matter how cool and collected a warbird trainer she may be, she cannot be cool in front of her mother and father. Her mother dotes on her constantly to the point of coddling her, and generally treats Sky like a baby bird, which Sky generally resents. Her father is a relic hunter, like Shantae's Uncle Mimic, but he is far less skilled, having dug up cursed items and dooming her prospective dates on more than one occasion. Sky repeatedly accuses both of trying to ruin her life."

A white bandage is wrapped around his right upper arm. He wears a white tank top underneath a short blue vest and has dark blue shorts. He also wears tan gloves with metal rings around the cuffs. In Risky's Revenge, he has bandages wrapped around both arms and does not wear a jacket. Throughout all of the games, his shoulders appear to be very boney.\n\nPersonality\nBolo is described as a \"block-head hero for hire\". Supposedly, he springs to life when he has a chance to fight, but he's often left behind during Shantae's adventures and has yet to show off these skills.\n\nBolo is frequently trying to seduce girls or spy on them, including Risky Boots, but fails every time. He's shown to be jealous of Bran-Son's popularity. However, he has a more argumentative brother-sister relationship with Shantae. Bolo serves as a sparring partner and punching bag for Shantae and as an assistant for Mimic. Bolo is the one who taught Shantae her Fighter Moves.\n\nIt is revealed that Bolo is nearsighted, although this may be just him being too literal."

By the time of Risky's Revenge, he owns a new workshop. It is also home to Shantae's friends Sky and Bolo as of Risky's Revenge. Scuttle Town has an Arabian architectural style.\n\nScuttlebutt is forced to sell the town to the Ammo Baron in order to save it from financial collapse.

The half-genie guardian of Scuttle Town, Shantae works tirelessly to thwart the plans of the nefarious lady-pirate, Risky Boots.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nShantae is a young woman with a very slender build. As a professional belly dancer, her outfit usually consists of sheer harem pants, a bra, and gold jewelry. This look is also known as the red bedlah attire and is the default look in every game, though it does change slightly as well. She has a relatively thin yet curvy figure and is rather short compared to some other characters in the game. Shantae has olive/tan-skin with blue eyes, and long growing purple hair tied up in a ponytail stem stalk. Her parentage is uncertain, but it is known that her mother was a genie and there is speculation about who her father was.\n\nShantae has had the ability to transform into many different things by using her magical powers. Depending on the adventure and circumstance, she also has worn many different outfits.\n\nPersonality\nShantae is an energetic, childish, happy-go-lucky tomboy who lacks some common sense, but noble girl who will place the safety of others above all else. Shantae finds it enriching and fulfilling to be helpful, which has caused her to sometimes help the wrong people. Shantae is incredibly optimistic and happy-go-lucky but knows when to be serious. Shantae can be a bit ditzy at times but is still rather clever. Shantae is somewhat childish and enjoys messing around in her free time. Shantae has a strong moral compass, however being raised with little supervision has left her mostly naive to sexual intricacies, making it easy to trick her. She is also shown to have a short fuse at times, especially when people waste her time. Shantae, as the guardian genie of Scuttle Town, Shantae lives in a lighthouse by the sea where she can spot incoming ships and trouble. She is initially portrayed as young and somewhat naive. Additionally, her strong sense of justice drives her to help people in need. She chases Risky Boots around the map to stop his plans, and as a result, has a strong enmity with the pirate. Slightly shy, Shantae is initially afraid of the citizens of Scuttle Town finding out about her half-genie status. Additionally, she often puts herself down; believing that being only half-genie is not enough. After being tricked by Risky and subsequently foiling his plans, she overcomes her insecurity and shyness coming to terms with these anxieties, and is happy that the townspeople still accept her. Shantae has a deep affection for her adoptive uncle, Mimic, as well as her friends Sky and Bolo, and at the end of the first game gives up the chance to enjoy eternal peace in the Genie Realm in order to be with them. She also considers the zombie Rottytops to be her friend, though Rotty's own attitude towards her, while friendly for the most part, is more ambivalent, as she does not hesitate to state that she would like to eat Shantae's brains (which Shantae seems to take as a joke\n\nShantae's Parents\nIt is mentioned several times that she doesn't know who her parents are, only that her mother was a genie. Although she's willing to explore her genie side, hoping that it will bring her closer to her mother, she turns down the genies' offer to stay in the Genie Realm, and shows expressing sadness as being even farther from her half-genie nature (and subsequently her mother) after having lost her magic powers.

Though never explicitly stated, this is probably the capital of Sequin Land.\n\nHave you ever heard of Sequin Land? It was once a magical place, protected from monsters and mishaps by beautiful Guardian Genies. Their heroism won long years of peace, during which many of the genies fell in love with mortal men. The resulting offspring were all girls, seemingly human but with a trace of magical power, often lying dormant or manifesting in unusual ways. Thus half-genies came into the world.\n\nSadly, as the ages passed large numbers of Guardian Genies began to disappear from Sequin Land until not one remained. Many folks imagined that they had been captured inside bottles, while others believed that the genies had returned to their own realm. With the guardians gone, Sequin Land began to fall prey to evil.\n\nIn spite of their lack of skills, the daughters of the Genies made a decision to pool their powers and stand against evil as best they could. Few and far between, these half-genies traveled the land, each choosing a kingdom to guard until peace could be won again. As they struggle to keep the peace, new villains emerge and ancient foes return to wreak havoc on Sequin Land. Is this newest generation of Guardian Genies up to the challenge?"

When the Valkyrur arrived in Europa, the Darcsen tribes fought them in a war which saw the Darcsens defeated and scattered across Europa, marked for millennia to come with the stigma of the \"Darcsen Calamity\".\n\nThe end of the war marked the first year of the Europan Calendar (EC).\n\nThe First Europan War\nMain article: First Europan War\nThe Industrial Revolution of the 18th Century EC led to skyrocketing demand for ragnite, pitting Europa's twin giants in a race for resources. When the crown prince of the Empire was assassinated at the start of the 20th Century, tensions spiraled into an all-out war with Gallia caught in the middle, its vast ragnite reserves making it a valuable target for the Empire. Though the Imperial force employed a corps of newly developed tanks against the Federation, hostilities soon became bogged down in fruitless trench warfare and the two exhausted powers ultimately signed a cease-fire agreement, while Gallia was able to successfully defend its territory from the Imperials.\n\nThe Second Europan War\nIn 1935 EC, tensions between the Empire and the Federation were once again high, a result of ragnite's scarcity. As a result of this re-ignited friction, the Empire struck into the Federation, cutting deep into its territory before the advance could be halted.\n\nEmboldened by this success, the Empire decided to try once again to invade Gallia, dispatching prince Maximilian and his Drei Stern to lead the assault. The seven month long campaign in Gallia ended in disaster and humiliation for the Empire, causing it to falter in its efforts across the front in Europa.\n\nAs of 1937 EC, the Empire and the Federation were still locked in a stalemate, with rising tensions between the two superpowers threatening to reignite war."

          "content": "Ragnite is a type of mineral with many different uses, from anti-tank weapons to fuel and medicine. The country of Gallia is known for its large Ragnite deposits. Sufficiently refined Ragnite emits sunlight-like light, while Ragnite ore glows blue.\n\nControl of viable Ragnite sources in Europa was the primary reason for both EWI and EWII.\n\nRagnite sees a wide variety of commercial and industrial applications. It is primarily used as an energy source, and Ragnite engines power tanks, wheeled vehicles and even locomotives and ships. Characters use Ragnaids composed of Ragnite in the field to heal wounds. Ragnite derivatives are also used as propellant and payload explosives in grenades, shells and rockets, and to make strong armour plating, such as the upgrades used for the Edelweiss and the Shamrock.\n\nThe wide variety of uses indicate Ragnite is somewhat like crude oil; much as crude oil can be refined into many different hydrocarbons with differing properties, so Ragnite can be formed into numerous specific types such as the \"Ragnoline\" used in vehicles. Most forms of Ragnite appear to be relatively volatile, though stable forms exist. It appears to replace petrochemicals in all applications; Ragnite is used for everything from vehicle propulsion to lighting. While oil is present in Europa, with the city of Fouzen possessing the bulk of Gallia's refineries for it, it is clearly behind Ragnite in importance.\n\nRagnite also has solid forms: it is apparently dense enough to be used as an armour material in tanks, as well as a penetrating element in armour-piercing ammunition. This usage is similar to the use of depleted uranium, though it seems hardened Ragnite is used as exterior plating rather than a middle layer in a composite armour scheme.\n\nHeat seems a primary concern in a Ragnite engine; vehicles are fitted with large radiator panels to disperse it, which emit the characteristic bright blue glow of Ragnite itself when operating. While Ragnite seems to generate electricity, the power from a Ragnite engine is from mechanical action; Isara Gunther modified the Edelweiss to use a turbine, and the Equus makes sounds which would be associated with a steam boiler. Presumably, the Ragnite is primarily used to supply heat to such systems, though combustion engines also appear to exist. Ragnite engines do not seem to produce visible exhaust; even though warships like the are seen with structures resembling smokestacks, these are simply used to elevate the radiator plates, and do not produce any smoke trail.\n\nIn Valkyria Chronicles 4, it is revealed that Ragnite can also be compressed: while this process was invented for the benign use of creating compressed Ragnite cartridges to power equipment in homes, it turned out to have military applications, with Ragnite implosion producing far greater levels of output than conventional systems. This technology was originally developed by Albert Miller and Heinrich Belgar, and has been the subject of extensive research in the United States of Vinland.\n\nRagnite is mined from deep underground deposits, and mining is said to be hazardous. The refining of Ragnite is equally dangerous and involve large amounts of pungent chemicals that leave workers with a distinctive and disagreeable smell; there is significant social stigma attached to this, and it is part of the negative stereotypes surrounding the Darcsens. Gallia's primary source of Ragnite is the mining works and refinery at Fouzen.\n\nIt is said that the Empire controls an enormous deposit of Ragnite beneath the Crystal Sea, but as of EWII has yet to develop any means of extracting it.\n\nRagnide gas is a thick, blue aerosol and a powerful nerve agent, apparently used extensively during EW1: it was banned by the Land War Treaty of the continental council, but Gallia still maintains some stocks of Ragnide shells in \"pre war armouries.\" During the DLC mission pack, Selvaria's Mission: Behind Her Blue Flame, Georg von Damon deploys these shells during his attempt to defend Ghirlandaio from Imperial attack, the gas proving potent enough to even disable a Valkyria. Fear of such weapons is apparently sufficient for Imperial engineers to carry antidotes to the gas."

When the crown prince of the Empire was assassinated at the start of the 20th Century, tensions spiraled into an all-out war.\n\nThe First Europan War was a particularly brutal and bloody war. During the conquest of Fhirald, the Imperial Army executed many captured Fhiraldian soldiers, only sparing those they believed to be of use to the occupying forces.\n\nDuring the conflict, the Imperial forces were the first to employ a corps of newly developed tanks and the use of tank and combined infantry tactics developed in leaps and bounds. However, the majority of the conflict was still fought using old-fashioned infantry tactics, which eventually descended into trench warfare.\n\nEventually the two exhausted powers signed a cease-fire agreement which lasted until the beginning of the Second Europan War. Interestingly, however, an official end to the war was never signed.\n\nDuring the war, Gallia's military, initially spearheaded by General Roald Kankkunen and later General Belgen Gunther's tank corps, foiled an Imperial invasion of eastern Gallia in a series of battles and engagements.\n\nMany areas of Gallia still bear the scars of these battles, the most obvious being Naggiar Plains, where vast networks of trenches and earthworks were dug out. They would later be refitted and reused by both the Gallian and Imperial armies in the Second Europan War.\n\nThe First Europan War never officially ended and tensions between the two sides did not abate due to numerous border disputes and the massing of military forces on both sides. The ceasefire held until the outbreak of the Second Europan War in 1935."

The operation was foiled by the early winter of 1935, and the Federation and the Empire signed an armistice that didn't last long, and effectively marked the beginning of the stalemate stage of EWII.[1]\n\nAlso in March of 1935, the Empire launched a separate invasion of Gallia with the intent to capture the small country's large ragnite reserves to supplement their own. The invasion was called off after the commander of the Gallia Invasion Force, Crown Prince Maximilian, was killed in battle. The Empire and Gallia signed a peace treaty that held at least until the end of 1937.\n\nIn late 1936, the Federation secretly sponsored a rebellion in Gallia, hoping that a new government would join the Federation or at least be more favorable to Federation influences. The civil war ended in late 1937 with the defeat of the rebel forces.\n\nAs of 1937, the Empire and the Federation each has made gains and losses in territory, with the end of the war nowhere in sight."

Already tightly bound by a network of marriages amongst their royalty, these nations now joined hands in a formal international alliance.\n\nWhile not technically an autocracy and possessing a parliament[1], the emperor enjoys limitless authority within the alliance. The Empire retains customs and practices held over from medieval times, and its people are known to harbor conservative views including a strong hatred for the Darcsen race, who are often put into forced labor camps to provide labour and materials for the Empire.\n\nThe culture of the Imperial Alliance still has strong roots in medieval times. This influence can be seen in the armor that the soldiers wear, and in the vows of fealty that each soldier makes to the king.\n\nThe capital of the Empire is Schwartzgrad.\n\nThe Empire places a heavy emphasis on armor and large caliber weapons, with many of its tanks greatly out-massing their Federation and Gallian counterparts. The latest weapons developed by the Empire include a variety of superheavy tanks (Batomys-class) and even a terrestrial dreadnaught, Marmota.\n\nRegions, Cities, & Areas of Interest:\n\nSchwartzgrad: The Imperial capital.\nEinhemt: Located northeast of the Siegval Line, it is considered to be the gateway into the northern Empire.\nLoweholm: An annexed city with an active underground resistance movement.\nPort Kosvall: An annexed port that serves as a supply depot for the Imperial Navy.\nReine: A small town in the western Empire.

Both the First Europan War and the Second Europan War were primarily conflicts arising between the Empire and the Federation over Ragnite resources.\n\nPrincipality of Gallia:\nRich in Ragnite minerals, Gallia was a target of Empire invasion during both the First Europan War and the Second Europan War. Both invasions were repelled by Gallian forces.\n\nAfter Prince Maximilian died in the Invasion of Gallia in 1935, the Empire signed a treaty ending its war with Gallia. As part of the agreement, members of the Imperial nobility, such as Helmut Bourdais, were sent to Gallia ostensibly to help further ties between the two nations. In reality, they were hostages against any new attempts by the Empire to invade.\n"

It is one of two main military powers in Europa, and a participant in both EWI and EWII.\n\nSometimes in colloquial usage, \"Federation\" may only refer to the Europan member nations/territories, thus excluding Vinland.\n\nPopular uprisings spurred on by the late 18th Century Industrial Revolution gave birth to a number of new democratic republics. The nascent Empire, formed to the east, represented a common threat, motivating a mutual defense agreement among these infant republics.\n\nThough an elected Head Councilor acts as the Federation's chief executive, unanimous agreements are rare among the constituent republics, meaning it often takes months to enact measures. Though a series of secret alliances and gains won by extortion and blackmail put the Federation ahead of the Empire in terms of national power, they have yet to defeat them on the field of war.\n\nThe Empire and Atlantic Federation were already at war when a large Imperial force under the command of the Imperial Crown Prince Maximilian invaded Gallia. For the most part, the Gallian front was of little concern to the Federation war effort, save for one specific event.\n\nThe Federation ambassador to Gallia at the time was Jean Townshend, and he tirelessly campaigned for Gallia to join the Federation and lend its famous militias and large supplies of Ragnite to their greater war effort. He was always rebuffed by the heiress to the Gallian throne, Cordelia Gi Randgriz, but had recently found an ally in her conniving and ambitious Prime Minister, Maurits von Borg.\n\nFrom this information, unclear figures within the Federation hatched a plot to kidnap Princess Cordelia and in her absence make von Borg the de facto ruler of Gallia. The plot involved disguising a crack Federation unit as members of the Gallian Royal Guard to get close to Cordelia, and then quickly extracting her in a Gallian APC. Ambassador Townshend was charged with organizing the details of the plot, and attempted to recruit Claude Wallace and elements of the Federation's elite Squad E: Claude, a Gallian himself, clearly sensed something was not right about the offer and declined it, saying he would pretend their conversation never took place.\n\nIt is not clear where the unit that ultimately performed the mission were recruited from, but they were stopped by the swift intervention of the Gallian militia's Squad 7 under Welkin Gunther. Ambassador Townshend successfully concealed his part in the operation, and retained his position. Von Borg, meanwhile, was executed at the order of Crown Prince Maximilian for his traitorous nature, after the Prime Minister attempted to perform the exact same power play with the Empire that he previously attempted with the Federation.\n\nIn early 1935 the military might of the Empire had pushed the Federation back, and a bold plan was created to remedy this, a massive counter-offensive called Operation Northern Cross aimed at punching through Imperial lines with the final goal nothing less than the seizure of the Imperial capital, Schwartzgrad.\n\nIn its early stages, Northern Cross was a phenomenal success, with Imperial forces left in full rout by the sudden offensive and even their attempts to muster a defense of the mighty Siegval Line ending in defeat. However, in their mad charge for Schwartzgrad, the Federation's forces had severely overextended their supply lines, and soon found themselves in the middle of an early and bitterly cold winter, without proper winter equipment. As the Federation forces hesitated, the Empire launched a massive offensive headed up by the tanks of Ausbruch, destroying the main Federation supply center at Lindbergh Base and forcing Federation forces to give back almost all of the territory they had taken as they retreated.\n\nAll platoons from the 2nd Regiment of the Edinburgh 32nd Armored Ranger Corps were split off from the main force and ordered to instead retreat across the Achtzehn Mountains to meet up with a Federation force landing on the coast. This turned out not to be a conventional landing fleet, but three Snow Cruisers participating in a secret mission, Operation Cygnus. While this was originally supposed to be a support operation, with the failure of Northern Cross the Snow Cruisers crossing the Crystal Sea to assault the Imperial capital was the Federation's last hope of bringing a quick end to the war.\n\nIn actuality, the Snow Cruisers had a more sinister purpose: each vessel's reactor could be turned into a Valkyrian Bomb, and the detonation of even once such device would be powerful enough to level Schwartzgrad. With the loss of their top ranks, the highly centralized Imperial military would be left in disarray, allowing the Federation's forces to defeat them in detail.\n\nNorthern Cross turned into a colossal meat grinder as even the Imperial advance stalled, with Federation and Imperial forces dying in unprecedented numbers as the Snow Cruisers secretly proceeded on their deadly mission, stalked by a crack unit from the secretive Imperial experimental strike force, X-O. The Empire grew desperate as they discovered the purpose of the ships with the detonation of the bomb on the Cavalier, and with the Centurion still functional and the recent news of Prince Maximilian's death at the hands of the Gallians, the Empire focused all efforts on defending Schwartzgrad, all but ignoring the continued battles raging to the west.\n\nCenturion successfully penetrated the defenses of Schwartzgrad, but the Valkyrian Bomb was not detonated following news of a stand-down order after the Empire signed an armistice agreement with the Federation. The final Snow Cruiser was ultimately lost after Heinrich Belgar attempted to detonate the bomb, and the role of the Snow Cruisers, as well as their deadly payload, was covered up in the aftermath of the war.\n\nPost 1935 EC\nThe Federation, while officially supporting Archduchess Cordelia's leadership of Gallia, secretly supported the Gallian Revolutionary Army during the Gallian Civil War of 1937, having secured a promise from Gilbert Gassenarl that as leader of Gallia he would join the Federation. They supplied the Revolutionary forces with arms, Ragnite, and even the battleship Dandarius, but following his assassination by his son Baldren Gassenarl and the GRA's loss of the Gallian capital, Federation logistical support effectively ended. Ambassador Townshend, who had fully supported the GRA, was aboard the Dandarius when she was sunk by the Gallian Navy, though his fate is not known."

          "content": "Full of nature and rich in Ragnite ore, the Principality of Gallia is a small independent nation which borders the Empire to the east and the Federation on its western edge. It's also the home nation to many protagonists and the main setting in Valkyria Chronicles 1, 2, 3. It also makes a minor appearance in Valkyria Chronicles 4.\n\nThis small, central, Europan nation is a constitutional monarchy, ruled by House Randgriz, the hereditary sovereign of Gallia. The first ruling ancestor of the house, revered as the legendary hero of the ancient War of the Valkyrur, built a castle on the site of what is now the capital city Randgriz, establishing it as the seat of Gallian rule.\n\nDespite its size of only 38,567 sq. km and a population of 4.32 million as of EW2, it boasts a rich and unique culture. The official currency is the Ducat (DCT).\n\nInternationally, Gallia is characterized by its policies of armed neutrality and universal conscription and is notable amongst smaller independent states for its success in declining to ally themselves to either of the warring superpowers that border it.\n\nThe nation was formally born in the 3rd Century, when Castle Randgriz was built and rule over surrounding areas began.\n\nWhen the Empire invaded Gallia at the turn of the 19th Century, the king renounced his crown, instead ruling over an autonomous region within the Empire as archduke. But as democratic movements swept western Europa, the archduke harnessed that energy in Gallia to push for freedom from the Empire, resulting in the War of Gallian Independence.\n\nStretched thin between multiple fronts, the Empire was unable to maintain its hold, and the small nation rose as the independent Principality of Gallia, declaring neutrality and establishing a system of universal conscription.\n\nWith the sea at its north and west and thick forests shielding it to the south, Gallia is naturally fortified against invasion, historically allowing it to repel even significantly larger foes.\n\nHilly plains cover sixty percent of the nation's land, and its mountains contain a rich store of ragnite ore, a valued source of energy. Large cities dot the flatlands to the north, while the rest is largely occupied by lush farmland.\n\nGallia enjoys a temperate oceanic climate with little variation in rain levels throughout the year, and the soil is highly fertile. Because growing conditions for livestock and grain are equally favorable, Gallia practices a mixed form of agriculture.\n\nRegions, Cities & Areas of Interest\nRandgriz: The capital of Gallia since its days as a monarchy, this ancient city has the longest history of any in Europa.\nAnthold: A harbor city on the Sea of Gallia in the South.\nBruhl: This small town lies on the Imperial border at the eastern edge of Gallia.\nFouzen: As one of Gallia's richest mining sites, this industry capital grew hand in hand with the evolution of ragnite science.\nGhirlandaio: A very mountainous area at the northern border of Gallia.\nKloden Wildwoods: This expansive primeval forest stretches across Gallia's south, forming a natural border with the Empire. Part of this region is the Leanbluff Forest, a hilly, wooded area to the east of Anthold.\nLanseal Military Academy: The primary military academy in Gallia.\nMellvere: A trade city situated on the River Mais in southern Gallia.\nYuell: A medium sized city in central Gallia which grew around Yuell University.\nThe Arlem Region: A plains area south of Mellvere with gently sloping terrain and fertile soil perfect for farming.\nThe Barious Desert: An arid desert devoid of all vegetation covers the eastern Gallian basin area, several tens of kilometers across. The Temple of the Valkyrur is located in this area.\nThe Daws Desert: A wasteland in southern Gallia.\nThe Diebal Mountains: A mountain range near the border in southern Gallia.\nThe Doerfein Mining Quarter: A series of mines spread throughout the Doerfein Mountains southeast of Yuell.\nThe Great Vasel Bridge: A massive iron drawbridge spans the Vasel River.\nThe Marberry Shore: One of several stretches of open shore north of the Fouzen industrial region.\nThe Naggiar Plains: Few areas within Gallia have been the grounds for more battles through history than the sweeping Naggiar Plains, found in the nation's northeastern region.\nThe Roendahl Canyon: A canyon in the upstream region of the River Mais east of Mellvere.\nHafen: A city near the borders with the Empire.\n\nArmed Forces\n\nGallia has a modestly small army compared to the other Europan powers, on account of its small population. As a result, Gallia relies heavily upon conscription to bolster its forces during times of war. Gallia is also known to have basic weapons training in schools, colleges, even universities as compulsory subjects, to ensure that Gallia's citizens are ready to be drafted at any time. The Gallian military focuses entirely upon weapons and tactics designed for defensive warfare.\n\nThe military has two main branches; the regular Army and the Militia. The regular Army is Gallia's full time military force, 80,000 strong and made up of well trained and disciplined soldiers, while the Militia is a force raised exclusively in wartime, made up of citizens who are drafted in with little training besides the subjects learned at school. Due to their inexperience at warfare and low levels of training most Militia members have (aside from veterans of previous conflicts), the regular Army tend to look down upon them and regard them as little use for anything more than cannon fodder. Gallia also has a Navy which is maintained by 10,000 Naval personnel. The Gallian Army also has 2,000 Military Police personnel.\n\nThe city of Randgriz also maintains its own force of soldiers, the Royal Guard, who act as the city's defence force and as the personal bodyguard of the Archduke/duchess."

            "Maximilian"
          ],
          "content": "Maximilian, also known as Maximilian Gaius Von Reginrave in the anime is the Imperial General and Prince behind the invasion of Gallia. He is the main antagonist of Valkyria Chronicles.\n\nValkyria Chronicles\nThe Empire was all but overflowing with princes and princesses, and Maximilian was just one of many sons born the current Emperor. The only difference in Maximilian's case was that his mother was not a legal wife of the Emperor but rather just his concubine. Since his mother was not officially affiliated with any members of the royal family, no one considered Maximilian to be a real prince. In fact the majority of the royal family treated Maximilian and his mother with great disdain, dubbing them to be stains on the royal family's name. Even as a young child, Maximilian understood what was happening around him, and was constantly concerned over his mother's safety. His mother always put on a brave face for him, however, and always told him to be proud of who he was. Inspired by her courage, Maximilian deeply loved and admired his mother.\n\nOne day, Maximilian was enjoying a pleasant train ride with his mother and their servants when the train was suddenly engulfed in an explosion. Bitter and paranoid, heirs to the Imperial throne had set a trap for Maximilian and his mother in order to reduce the threat of competition. Having lost his mother and all of the people he truly trusted in this world in the explosion, Maximilian felt a powerful hatred for the Empire brewing inside of him. From that day forward, Maximilian's actions were guided only by his desire to avenge his mother's death, and to make his mother's the true and royal bloodline of the Empire.\n\nIn order to get his revenge on the Empire, Maximilian knew that he would have to possess an insurmountable amount of power. His interest soon turned to the famous legends of the ancient Valkyrur people and their \"Valkyrur Power.\" Maximilian began his search by tracing the remaining descendants of the ancient race, and eventually discovered the existence of Selvaria, a Valkyria that was being quarantined at the Imperial Valkyria Research Facility. With his true intentions cunningly masked, he removed Selvaria from her dire situation in the research facility and invited her to stay with him at his estate. Maximilian invested much of his time and finances to ensure that Selvaria received the best education the Empire had to offer, hoping that Selvaria would eventually become a useful pawn in his grand scheme.\n\nWith the commencement of the Second Europan War came news that an ancient Valkyrur weapon was said to be stored within the capital city of Gallia. Maximilian's next objective was clear, and he soon proposed an invasion of Gallia to the Imperial war assembly. Maximilian cited Gallia's abundant supply of ragnite as the motivation for his suggestion. With Selvaria's Valkyrur Power at his side and his military prowess speaking for itself, Maximilian was granted leadership of the Imperial force that was to invade Gallia.\n\nInitially, Maximilian's plan to conquer Gallia and acquire the Valkyrur Holy Lance seemed to be progressing exactly as he had planned. With Squad 7's interference and Alicia discovering her Valkyrur Power, however, Maximilian's plan quickly began crumbling around him. In a final attempt to regain some semblance of control, Maximilian transformed himself into an artificial Valkyria. This form offered Maximilian the power he had sought his entire life but on October 10th 1935, Faldio made the choice to sacrifice himself in order to end Maximilian's ambitions for good.\n\nGeneral Maximilian commands the Gallian front of the Empire's invasion army. He is the quasi-crown prince of the Empire, and has been hailed as a great hero for his superior political and military prowess. Being an illegitimate child of the current Emperor, Maximilian had to endure much abuse as a child and his mother was murdered out of spite. This tragic upbringing left Maximilian with a deeply rooted inability to trust others. Maximilian feels neither love for nor loyalty to the Empire, and in fact bitterly hates it. As a leader, Maximilian completely ignores things like social standing and rank, treating everyone equally and rewarding those who serve him well. It is because of this personal policy that he chose to make use of people like Jaeger and Selvaria, a wise decision that has afforded him many victories. Since Maximilian only sees people for the skills they possess, he does not notice or understand that Selvaria harbors a true and deep love for him. Maximilian recognizes Dahau's elite skills but has always felt suspicious of his obviously false displays of loyalty.\n\nIn order to avenge his mother and conquer the Empire, Maximilian attached Randgriz City's Valkyrur Holy Lance to the Marmota, his massive land-based battleship. Unfortunately for Maximilian, moving the Marmota out of Randgriz City in hopes of countering the Gallian Militia's attack was his undoing, and he was killed in battle against Squad 7.\n\nPersonality and Characteristics\nMaximilian never allowed himself to depend on anyone other than himself, nor did he speak more than necessary. Whenever Maximilian did speak, he almost always used royal plurals to refer to himself, as is typical of monarchs and members of aristocratic circles.\n\nDespite his somewhat aloof personality, Maximilian was blessed with the natural charisma and beautiful appearance often expected of royal blood. In addition, he is extremely principled with regards to rules of conduct and duty, and shows no compassion for war criminals and traitors. He also had great regard for Europa's past, at one point passing up an opportunity to easily kill Welkin Gunther in order to avoid damaging the interior of a sacred temple. These attributes, coupled with his policy of offering equal opportunity to anyone of any social class, soon had many skilled followers flocking to his banner. Maximilian had also been trained in the art of battle ever since he was a child, and it is said that his combat abilities were superior even to those of his Drei Stern.\n\nMaximilian's tendency to regard people in terms of their usefulness to him, without reference to anything else, led to him having some unusual attitudes for a citizen of the Empire. Most notably, he did not care in the slightest when Cordelia Gi Randgriz revealed to him that she was actually a Darcsen. His strong sense of duty also had a dark side. Anyone who failed in their duty, no matter how unreasonable (or even if the duty was not to Maximilian at all, as Maurtis von Borg discovered), rendered themselves worthless in his eyes.\n\nThough his followers trusted him and were quite loyal to him, Maximilian's decisions were guided only by his final objective. When it came to Selvaria, Maximilian did not treat her like a simple pawn, but rather was quite careful in the way he treated her. This was not due to any amount of romantic feelings, however, but was instead a reflection of the intense jealousy he felt regarding her inhuman powers. So desperate was he to avenge his mother that Maximilian desired nothing in this world but raw power."

            "Brotherhood of Steel"
          ],
          "content": "The Brotherhood of Steel (commonly abbreviated to BoS) is a post-War technology-focused paramilitary order with chapters operating across the territory of the former United States. Founded by rogue U.S. Army officer Captain Roger Maxson shortly after the Great War, the Brotherhood's core purpose is to preserve advanced technology and regulate its usage. Despite often being relatively isolationist, the Brotherhood has proved to be one of the most important organizations in the history of the wasteland, though their exact levels of power and influence have varied over time and by chapter. In 2076, the NBC division of West Tek achieved breakthrough results in the Pan-Immunity Virion Project. The United States Defense Department, fearing international espionage, moved a military team under the command of Colonel Robert Spindel and Captain Roger Maxson onto the site to secure and oversee the project, now dubbed the FEV (Forced Evolutionary Virus) project. On January 7, 2077, all FEV research was moved to the newly constructed Mariposa Military Base to commence testing of the virus on human subjects. The security team was transferred to the newly constructed base as well, to provide protection for the research going on within the facility. They were not informed of the nature of the research. The situation unraveled shortly before October 10, 2077. The soldiers stationed at Mariposa discovered the fact that the scientists under their care were performing experiments with the Forced Evolutionary Virus on military prisoners. The revelation prompted a nervous breakdown in Colonel Spindel, who locked himself in his office. Captain Maxson was the only officer left to handle the deteriorating situation. Soldiers were screaming for blood and the whole situation was at risk of devolving into a bloodbath. On October 12, when Maxson had to step in to prevent one of his subordinates from killing a member of the science team, he ordered interrogations of the science team under his authority as acting commander. He hoped to prevent a full mutiny by offering his troops a semblance of justice. The first scientist was brought before Maxson a day later, on October 13. Chief Researcher Robert Anderson explained that human experiments at the facility were sanctioned by the government. He outlined the program to the captain, emphasizing the fact that it was the government that ordered it. When Maxson refused to believe him, the scientist lost his nerve and started screaming how he was just following orders and that he was a military man just like Maxson. The captain shot him in response. He rationalized it as trying to prevent a full-scale mutiny, but even he did not believe it. The killing of Robert Anderson effectively established Maxson as the leader of the rebellion. His position was further reinforced just two days later on October 15, when he attempted to speak to Colonel Spindel through the door of his office. It soon became clear that the colonel had lost touch with reality, so Maxson and several of his men broke down the door just in time to hear the colonel apologize and shoot himself. Subsequent scientist interrogations invariably ended in executions. Erin Shellman held out the longest by October 18, finally convincing the captain that the experiments were really ordered by the government with her detailed account. On October 20, 2077, Captain Maxson declared his unit in full secession from the United States over the radio, attempting to force the government to respond to the situation at Mariposa. No response came. A day later, he ordered the families of soldiers under his command to take shelter within the facility. On October 23, 2077, the Great War struck. As Maxson was halfway through prying the story from Head Researcher Leon Von Felden, the facility lost contact with the outside world as nuclear weapons started to drop. Spared the nuclear devastation, Mariposa protected the inhabitants from nuclear fallout flooding the wasteland. Fearing that China would soon make up for the oversight, on October 24, Maxson ordered his soldiers and their families to prepare to vacate the base the next day. On October 25, Sergeant Platner volunteered to take atmospheric readings outside the base. Reporting no significant amounts of radiation in the atmosphere, final preparations for the Exodus were undertaken. On October 26, Maxson ordered the remains of the scientists to be buried in the wastes outside the base. A day later, on October 27, former US servicemen and their families left the base under the lead of Captain Roger Maxson, heading for the Lost Hills government bunker in the south. In November, a few weeks later, war refugees arrived at the bunker. The people suffered casualties along the way, as while the soldiers were protected by T-51 power armor, their families had no armor to speak of. Marauders that attacked the caravan quickly learned to target the unprotected civilians. Though the attackers paid with two lives for every one they took, many were lost, including Roger Maxson's wife but not his teenage son. Several soldiers broke off during the Exodus as well, led by Sergeant Dennis Allen. Ignoring warnings from Captain Maxson and defying the group's will, Allen's faction separated from the convoy in order to excavate the remains of the West Tek Research Facility using their power armor. They were never heard from again. Around 2151, the Brotherhood sent out knights to seek out Allen's group or its remains. All they found were desolate ruins. The Exodus survivors claimed the Lost Hills bunker as their own. The refugees expanded and adapted it to fit their own needs, becoming a bastion of technology in a world that has lost centuries of technological development overnight. Using surviving satellite connections, Maxson reached out across the continent, broadcasting a request for contact.  By chance, Maxson found an old friend in Appalachia, Lieutenant Elizabeth Taggerdy of the US Army Rangers. Although initially hesitant to trust him, due to the public declaration of secession, she gambled and left the channel open. As Maxson revealed the depth of atrocities perpetrated by the United States government, Taggerdy's faith in the system was shaken, then dismantled. Following the winter spent at Camp Venture, she joined Maxson's banner. Witnessing how people around him slowly succumbed to depression, Captain Maxson formulated a new ideology for the survivors. It took him years to create it, replacing the tarnished Stars and Stripes with new symbols, new ranks, and new ideas to replace the ones scorched in nuclear fire. They would provide meaning for people before they became lost in the depths of despair after losing their friends, family, and their entire world. Although some under his command, particularly Lieutenant Taggerdy, were skeptical of his plans, Maxson believed that the way forward lay in new traditions and a new mythology, free of the burden of the past. He also believed that it would prevent any surviving politicians from exercising their authority over former American soldiers, especially those with an agenda that involved burning Americans on the funeral pyre of the regime. By June 20, 2082, all members under his command switched over to using Brotherhood ranks and practices. The Brotherhood kept growing in New California, welcoming into its ranks a National Guard unit that was formerly stationed near Mariposa. They acquired several bunkers  and sent expeditions as far as the Mojave Wasteland, gathering intelligence and new recruits. As the Brotherhood in New California developed, so did its sister organization in Appalachia under Paladin Taggerdy. Although she showed a bias towards candidates with a military background while building up the ranks, she eventually understood Roger Maxson's vision and continued to expand and develop the organization using Camp Venture as a training outpost. Despite initial resistance to the new rank system by the rest in her outfit, the new ideas offered by Maxson eventually took root and were accepted.\n\nIn Appalachia, the Brotherhood's insistence on acquiring munitions for their fighting against mutants led to ruffled feathers, especially with the Responders prior to the Christmas Flood in December 2082. However, they eventually found a common tongue, standing together during the Battle of Huntersville in May 2086. Although the Brotherhood sustained losses, it prevailed. This coincided with the announcement of a new mandate by Roger Maxson at Lost Hills: to gather, record, and save the collective knowledge of mankind for future generations, to act as a catalyst for the rebirth of civilization in time. Some in Appalachia responded to this new policy with enthusiasm, others with grudging acceptance, and yet others, like Hank Madigan, left the Brotherhood to join the Responders.\n\nThe new mission quickly took a backseat, however, as the Appalachian Brotherhood encountered the scorchbeasts and the Scorched in the Cranberry Bog. Conferring with Maxson's ace researcher at Lost Hills, Scribe Hailey Takano, the Brotherhood in Appalachia quickly calculated that the scorchbeasts represented a potential extinction event for humanity. Lost Hills supplied a number of designs and weapon schematics to help stem the tide, including a sonic generator and an automated research program. Taggerdy pleaded with Maxson to grant her team permission to use nuclear weapons against the scorchbeasts but was forbidden by him because he found the concept of using nuclear weapons, even to help fight the scorchbeasts, to be too morally abhorrent after their world was destroyed by nukes.\n\nBy the 2090s, communication between Lost Hills and Appalachia was on steady decline due to failing Old World communication infrastructure. Before being cut off, Maxson ordered Taggerdy to hold the tide, and proscribed the use of nuclear weapons. Eventually, the communications failed entirely, separating Lost Hills from Appalachia. The chapter in Appalachia fought on, trying to destroy the scorchbeasts through attrition, but by 2093, their numbers dwindled to the point where they were forced to close down Camp Venture, their first base, and focus their remaining forces at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain Power Plant. Declining support from the Responders and the constant fighting just to stem the tide of the Scorched and their masters took their toll, preventing the Brotherhood from completing the automated research program at Vault-Tec University, supplied to them by Takano. Eventually, the Brotherhood launched Operation Touchdown. This last ditch effort was launched in January 2095 and briefly stemmed the tide at the cost of the entire strike force, which included Knight Moreno and Paladin Taggerdy. Ultimately, the Brotherhood in Appalachia was wiped out in their last stand at Fort Defiance and Thunder Mountain on August 18-19, 2095, marking the end of the original Brotherhood in Appalachia. However, by 2103, a small group of reinforcements arrived on their way from Lost Hills to examine various centers of technology across the country, expand the Brotherhood across the East Coast, and find out what happened to Taggerdy. Known as the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force, they were led by Leila Rahmani and Daniel Shin and were to set up base in Fort Atlas in Appalachia. The team also had a scribe named Odessa Valdez. While Maxson's motive was sincere, wishing to find out what happened to his friend Taggerdy, Rahmani became certain the Council of Elders had an ulterior motive: to remove her influence and meddling as she would often argue over their ways.\n\nAlong their hike across the country, the expedition found a town under threat by raiders. Wanting to assist them, Rahmani and Shin agreed to providing the townsfolk with weapons to help defend them. Unfortunately, the raiders were able to steal the guns and kill the townsfolk. During the assault, the Brotherhood lost one of their valued members, Alan Connors, and obtained two young refugee siblings who lost their parents, Marcia and Maximo Leone. This incident would set off a division between Rahmani and Shin, with Shin wanting himself and Rahmani to stand trial with the Council of Elders. Upon arriving in Appalachia, the group was dismayed to discover that Taggerdy's Brotherhood was wiped out by the scorchbeasts, with Vernon Dodge being the only known survivor. Rahmani decided that in order to establish the Brotherhood's presence in the region, the organization needed to cooperate with Appalachia's other factions, particularly the settlement of Foundation. Shin became skeptical of Rahmani's choices, particularly her desire to delay the re-establishment of contact with the elders in Lost Hills. Rahmani and Shin dealt with numerous conflicts, including Meg Groberg's raiders, battles against super mutants, and a plan to infect the water cycle with FEV orchestrated by a driven scientist.\n\nDuring a mission to explore an Enclave research facility, Rahmani, feeling that the elders from Lost Hills were a hindrance in her ideals of establishing the Brotherhood as a peacekeeping force, destroyed the radio transmitter, which infuriated Shin. As a result, there is no confirmation of the Brotherhood in Appalachia re-establishing contact with the Brotherhood in California, as well as their status post-2105. In 2135, Roger Maxson died of cancer. Already a legendary figure to the Brotherhood, he was essentially deified as the Founder and Deliverer. His son, Maxson II, replaced him as the high elder, while his grandson, John Maxson, joined the paladin caste, showing great promise. Around 2141, the Brotherhood ceased admitting new members from the outside, relying solely on their natural growth for increasing their numbers. The Brotherhood was a major power in the region at this point, firmly exercising their control on the lands surrounding their bunker and forming trade relations with the neighboring towns, especially the Hub. However, the focus on hard sciences gave in to the detriment of humanities, history in particular. This decline in soft sciences eventually led to some initiates of the youngest generations having no idea who Roger Maxson was. In 2150, they clashed with the newly reformed Vipers. The battles intensified in subsequent years, culminating in the death of High Elder Maxson II in 2155. John Maxson's father expected the raiders to break formation and flee when faced with Brotherhood warriors clad in powered armor, but did not account for their religious ferocity. A poisoned arrow nicked him when his helmet was off, and he died within hours. John Maxson was promoted to the elder council, while Rhombus was tasked with conducting a campaign of extermination against the Vipers. The paladins tracked down and wiped out almost all of their members within the span of a month. A handful of Vipers were able to flee north and east into the mountain range; while small groups continued to exist and raid in New California, they never regained their full power. Both Rhombus and John Maxson would eventually ascend to leadership roles, with John Maxson becoming the high elder in 2159 and promoting Rhombus to the role of head paladin. During the campaign, the Brotherhood sent a few scouts and emissaries to the Hub to track down Vipers members, and from these beginnings, the Hub and the Brotherhood began full trade relations. Caravans had delivered to the Brotherhood before, but not long after the destruction of the Vipers, caravan trains ran directly from the Hub to the Brotherhood on a regular basis.  While the situation remained peaceful and prosperous, issues would develop between the Hub and the Brotherhood from time to time. In the late 2150s, the water merchants of the Hub attempted to barter a large quantity of water for a weapons stockpile. Although the Brotherhood turned down the offer, the merchants attempted to take the weapons regardless. The thieves were caught, but the Brotherhood elders voted down a retaliatory expedition. In 2161, the Brotherhood discovered the presence of a new enemy. In October, a group of knights on a patrol in the badlands discovered a dead super mutant. After examining the creature, Head Scribe Vree determined that it was sterile, but also notes that there must have been a central location that created these mutants. The elder council, fearing a potential invasion, enacted several security decrees, including a moratorium on training new recruits until the threat passed. The elders also sent out several scouts north and east into the badlands. Only one returned from the east, reporting an encounter with twenty super mutants,  and none at all returned from the north. The council could not reach an agreement on how to act. Even as Hub merchant caravans started disappearing in the northern wastes, the elders refused to act until they were fully certain that there was an army massing in the northern mountains. The impasse was broken by the arrival of the Vault Dweller. Having rescued a Brotherhood initiate from bandits in the Hub, the Vault Dweller visited the Brotherhood and accepted the mission to the Glow, to recover the disk belonging to Sergeant Dennis Allen to learn the fate of the splinter faction from the Mariposa Rebellion. The Vault Dweller surprised everyone by surviving and returning with the artifact. They became the first outsider to join the Brotherhood in nearly twenty years. The Brotherhood shared what knowledge they had and some of their advanced technology with the Vault Dweller, allowing them to seek out the Master and destroy him in the Boneyard. Following the death of the super mutant leader, the Brotherhood further aided the Vault Dweller's quest, sending a team of crack assault paladins to storm Mariposa. Following the destruction of the Unity, the Brotherhood aided other human settlements to drive the mutants away with minimal loss of life on both sides of the conflict. The Brotherhood remained out of the power structure for a time, becoming a major research and development house by reintroducing advanced technology into New California at a slow pace. The wise guidance of Rhombus arguably brought the Brotherhood to the zenith of its power. The Brotherhood had good relations with the developing New California Republic, to the point that one of the states of the federation was named after the founder of the Brotherhood: Maxson. However, Lost Hills was never incorporated into the NCR. Over the years, the Brotherhood grew confident in its status as the sole source of advanced technology left to mankind, and allowed its prominence and influence to wane, growing stagnant. This stagnancy made them unable to deal with the technologically superior Enclave, when the Brotherhood learned of their existence circa 2240. In order to learn more about them, the Brotherhood reactivated a network of outposts in Northern California to observe Enclave activity. Thanks to their low profile, they achieved practical anonymity, even in the populous San Francisco. Once the Enclave was apparently destroyed by the Chosen One, the Brotherhood was without a foe to face. In an effort to end the stagnation, the Brotherhood expanded eastward (including the formation of the Mojave chapter under Elder Elijah) and sent out expeditions to recover technology, going as far as the Capital Wasteland in 2255, with the expedition under Senior Paladin Owyn Lyons. The Brotherhood's presence in the east suffered a further setback when Elder Owyn Lyons, head of the Capital Wasteland division, refused a direct order from the Lost Hills Elder Council, confirming their suspicions that he had gone rogue and was no longer pursuing the original mission. In response, the Brotherhood completely shut off communications to Lyons' division and denied them any reinforcements. By 2277, the Brotherhood was well-established in the Capital Wasteland with their headquarters at the Citadel in Washington D.C. under the leadership of Owyn Lyons. The Enclave, however, wanted to control Project Purity for themselves, leading to a conflict between the Brotherhood and the Enclave, culminating in the Battle of Project Purity. The Brotherhood were able to prevent the Enclave's assault using a giant fighting robot called Liberty Prime. Although this was a short-term boon for the East Coast Brotherhood, changes were on the horizon for the restorationists under Lyons. The key blow to the organization came with the death of Owyn Lyons circa 2278 and the loss of now-Elder Sarah Lyons later that same year. With the seat of power emptied, the remaining Brotherhood members elected multiple ineffectual leaders. Meanwhile, the adolescent Squire Arthur Maxson matured into a capable warrior and tactician, eventually defeating Shepherd, the new warboss of the Capital Wasteland super mutants, in 2282. This feat earned him a provisional leadership position. In fact, this position was bestowed by West Coast elders, who revealed that they still monitored their errant brethren. Maxson's position solidified in 2283, when he negotiated a treaty with the Brotherhood Outcasts, bringing them back into the fold and reforming the entire organization, abandoning Lyons' doctrine. Lyons' Brotherhood became a distant memory as Maxson restored the original mission of the Brotherhood of Steel. While some members found this distasteful and left, many still remained, proud to serve a refocused Brotherhood. Maxson became leader of the Brotherhood's Eastern branch, setting it on a new, more authoritarian path. Around this same time, the Brotherhood began constructing a massive airship known as the Prydwen at the conquered former Enclave facility of Adams Air Force Base; the ship began full operation in 2282. In California, the rampant expansionism of the New California Republic would eventually lead to a collision course with the Brotherhood. As the NCR's power grew, the Brotherhood adopted a policy of reclaiming technology from people outside the order, energy weapons most of all. The disagreements over the way technology should be handled eventually resulted in a full-out war with the New California Republic. The Brotherhood was eventually forced into a retreat. At least six Brotherhood bunkers were lost to the NCR, four of them destroyed by the Brotherhood themselves in a last-ditch attempt to deny them to the enemy. The most well-known confrontation occurred during the NCR's Operation: Sunburst in 2276. Under Elder Elijah's leadership, the Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood of Steel was operating out of the solar power plant of HELIOS One when the NCR launched an attack. The NCR's numerical superiority over the Brotherhood, coupled with Elder Elijah's immense reluctance to leave Helios, allowed the NCR to overwhelm the defenders, leading to the loss of over half the chapter. The Mojave chapter of the Brotherhood was considered effectively neutralized. The Mojave chapter went under lockdown following their defeat at HELIOS One and the retreat to Hidden Valley. Despite their victory over the Brotherhood, the war would cost the NCR dearly. Apart from losses in manpower and materiel, the greatest victim of the war was the NCR's economy. The NCR's gold reserves were completely destroyed by Brotherhood raids: new gold coins could not be minted and paper money could not be properly backed with gold. NCR citizens panicked and rushed to reclaim the listed face value of currency from the NCR's remaining gold reserves. Since the NCR was unable to realize these withdrawals, particularly towards the frontier, faith in their currency considerably dropped. To protect against an actual economic collapse, the NCR government abandoned the gold standard and established fiat currency, not payable in specie. Since then, many wastelanders lost faith in it as a medium of worth, both as a result of it not being backed by anything but the government's word and the inevitable inflation. In response to the loss of faith, merchant consortiums of the Hub established their own currency, the veritable bottle cap, backing it with a standardized measure of water. After discovering advanced signals originating from the Institute, the Prydwen traveled to the Commonwealth. The Brotherhood established its headquarters at Boston Airport. The vessel serves multiple roles for the Brotherhood, including those of aircraft carrier, command center, clinic, personnel quarters, equipment maintenance bay and research facility. n plotting a course to find, access and destroy the Institute, Elder Maxson determined the first initiative to be repairing Liberty Prime back to working order. The Brotherhood is still active in the Los Angeles region around the year 2296. They also have their own airship, the Caswennan, which appears to be similar to the Prydwen. The Brotherhood is a military order with a strictly enforced hierarchy and chain of command. At the foundation of the hierarchy lies the Chain That Binds doctrine. It mandates obedience to one's superiors and forbids circumventing ranks when giving orders. Superiors may only give orders to their direct subordinates, but not their subordinate's subordinates. Although intended to ensure the cohesion of command, the doctrine has been generally interpreted as a simple mandate of obedience within the order, with the order flow requirements ignored, abandoned, or altered in practice. However, it does provide a technicality that can be invoked to relieve members of their rank, up to and including elders. Roger Maxson's goals in inventing a new tradition and mythology for the Brotherhood were two-fold. First, they would ensure that members of the Brotherhood would be stripped of their ties to the pre-War military and government, ensuring that any surviving general or politician would not be able to invoke their oaths and use them to unleash nuclear devastation on the world again (as was the case with Secretary of Agriculture Thomas Eckhart in Appalachia). Second, it would give the survivors an idea to believe in, something they could dedicate themselves to, and find meaning in their lives after the nuclear war. The inspiration came from the fall of the western Roman Empire when the knights and scribes kept the fire of civilization going after the empire imploded. As a rule, most Brotherhood chapters do not have an internal economy and allocate resources based on need, including weapons, armor, and even augmentations. Outside recruits are a special case: While they will receive basic equipment (such as Brotherhood armor and weekly allotment of ammunition), and an allotment of rations to maintain their health, they must serve for ten years before the Brotherhood will provide its most advanced services without charge. Higher-ranking members may bypass this requirement and allocate equipment at their discretion, for example, to reward services rendered to the Brotherhood or provide tools necessary for a mission. All equipment beyond personal items is issued by the Brotherhood and carefully tracked by serial number, especially weapons. The Brotherhood has several distinct classes that define a member's standing in the Brotherhood social structure, with a strict hierarchy distinguishing each member's position.\n\nThe Brotherhood is egalitarian in nature, with male and female members both being able to rise up to any rank. At the Brotherhood's foundation, however, the women of the Brotherhood were also called \"Brothers\" instead of \"Sisters,\" which would not carry over to the East Coast chapter. The beliefs of the Brotherhood were shaped by the experiences of Roger Maxson at Mariposa Military Base and in the aftermath of the Great War. At first, the Brotherhood focused on aiding survivors to the best of its ability, acting as an armed fighting force, rather than the military order it would become. The change came with the realization that the collective knowledge of humanity was in danger of being lost for generations to come. To keep the secrets of the past alive, Maxson decided to dedicate the Brotherhood to the preservation of technology and human knowledge, collecting it in order that the Brotherhood might become the catalyst for humanity's rebirth. As the guardians of civilization, the Brotherhood would focus on the big picture, with direct aid considered a secondary concern. While scribes were originally considered second-rate members, tools to protect the knights and maintain the Brotherhood's bases, this change in priorities placed them on equal footing with soldiers of the Brotherhood, tasked with preserving and developing technologies recovered from the field by the knights. Maxson's ultimate intention was to establish the Brotherhood as an organization that works closely with people outside of the Brotherhood, as guardians of civilizations, not its gatekeepers. "

Taking their name from the historic Abolitionist Movement, they revere Abraham Lincoln for his role in ending formal slavery in the southern United States through the Emancipation Proclamation and subsequent victory in the American Civil War, which paved the way for the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, abolishing slavery across the United States. Their goal is to resurrect Lincoln's ideals and bring his vision, of all men being free and equal, to the wasteland. Unfortunately, a lot of their knowledge is of dubious quality, warped by centuries of mistranslation and poor record keeping. Hannibal organized the group about six years prior, around 2271, after escaping slavery himself. In 2277, it is based in the Temple of the Union, a ruined office building containing the head of the statue from Lincoln Memorial that Hannibal discovered while on the run. The Abolitionists use the building as a safe haven for runaway slaves, providing them with food and supplies, then helping them on their way to freedom. However, the Temple is at capacity and lacks food, water, and shelter space to house runaway slaves. Hannibal wants to relocate to the Lincoln Memorial in downtown D.C., but requires aid to scout the area out and remove any threats, particularly super mutants. Relocating there would also help Hannibal create a proper shining beacon of hope for all slaves across the Capital Wasteland. Hamlin hopes that rebasing to the Memorial together with a restored Gettysburg Address will eventually spread stories of a safe haven for slaves, inspiring them to flee their slaving masters or even rise up against them in revolt. His followers agree with him, as the Abolitionists are the only ones making a stand against Paradise Falls and slavery in the Capital Wasteland: Neither Rivet City nor Owyn Lyons' Brotherhood chapter bother with helping slaves. Apart from sheltering freedmen at the Temple, small groups of Abolitionists are known to take on bounties against known slavers in the area."

          ],
          "content": "The Enclave is a paramilitary organization and quasi-state originating from the pre-War American deep state consisting of high-ranking political, military, and corporate figures. It claims to be the direct continuation of the United States and its government, despite seizing power by subverting continuity of government protocols and murdering non-Enclave government survivors to continue the war against communism. Enclave ideology eventually evolved into pseudo-scientific racism and social Darwinism, deeming all non-Enclave humans to be inferior, near-human mutants to be exterminated. The resulting genocide to create a racially pure state of \"true humans,\" its authoritarian structure, and numerous other atrocities, including slavery, human experimentation, and unprovoked attacks on American citizens, resulted in the Enclave being seen by the rest of humanity and even its former members as a fascist remnant of the pre-War government or simply \"the rich old bastards who didn't want to give up their power.\" All Enclave members are considered war criminals and ruthlessly pursued, including by the New California Republic and the Brotherhood of Steel. The Enclave has patterned itself after the pre-War United States of America, scaling down its structure to match its smaller size. The Enclave is led by a president, elected by the people of the Enclave without a term limit. The Enclave also has a congress, but there is no mention of a judicial branch. Some governmental agencies have also been reformed in the Enclave. The Atomic energy Commission exists but has been scaled down significantly and around 2242 was responsible simply for maintaining the oil rig's nuclear reactor. The Enclave's society in its heyday was characterized by secrecy, pervasive surveillance, and conformity, particularly under President Richardson. The slightest sign of discontent was seen as disloyalty and grounds for permanent reassignment to mainland duties, rather than the cozy confines of the oil rig.  The situation was different on the mainland: All members were expected to be able to produce identification papers at a moment's notice, The president is assisted by a vice president, who together form the executive branch of the government. and summary execution authorized at the commanding officer's discretion, without the need for court martial. If they so decided, they could decide to execute the offender on the spot, for example, for disobeying a direct order, but even carelessness and breaking delicate equipment (eg. EnclaveNet infrastructure) could easily lead to facing the firing squad. The atrocities were packaged as patriotic necessity, or rather, jingoism, emphasized by the ever-present patriotic anthems and iconography. For example, both Richardson's and Eden's speeches were preceded by a variety of anthems. Though most of the Enclave were conformists, dissension was present. While in Appalachia this led to a civil war and its extinction, in New California there were more outlets. The opening of Navarro and mainland operations allowed dissenters to simply desert its ranks and blend in with the wasteland population, benefiting from ignorance. This eventually changed, as the NCR and the Brotherhood became aware of the extent of the organization's crimes. The Enclave claims to be the direct continuation of the pre-War United States of America, but ignores the duties and laws of the state in favor of entrenching its own power; standard protocols implemented during the Great War included the murder of all non-Enclave personnel at facilities it controlled, such as elected members of Congress not part of the organization at CB 002. Enclave members weren't safe from each other either, as at the same location, refusal to fall in behind Thomas Eckhart resulted in a purge through mass gassing. Eckhart was determined to eradicate communism and its supporters through any means necessary. The planned genocide was to be carried out through any means necessary, including mutation experiments that rendered subjects questionably human and releasing mutants and hostile robots againt American citizens, to trick the AALS to raise DEFCON, and gain access to the nuclear silos. This promise was used to recruit soldiers to the Enclave banner, promising vengeance for the losses sustained in the Great War. The Sino-American War continued in the ranks of the Enclave, but morale suffered, leading General Ellen Santiago to question whether eradicating communism and vengeance justified tormenting and killing American survivors, on top of the murders of Congressmen and fellow Enclave members. The disagreement eventually spiraled into a civil war, extinguishing the Enclave in Appalachia, around early 2085. The Enclave faction on the opposite end of the continent, centered around the last President of the United States, survived. The plans to eradicate communism through genocide evolved into a plan to exterminate all non-Enclave humans. The Enclave used pseudo-scientific justifications, declaring that subtle alterations in DNA of humans outside the Enclave make them near-human mutants, who must be exterminated to maintain the integrity of the human race. This position was adopted around 2140, with the Enclave styling itself the last remaining bastion of humanity on Earth, and the only salvation of the human race. The idea of \"saving the human race\" has caused the Enclave to reject any cohabitation with non-Enclave humans. Before the War, the Enclave was a cabal of powerful individuals from across the United States, including presidents, members of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, prize-winning scientists, members of the military, influential politicians, wealthy industrialists, and other powerful men and women who together formed the group. In the opinion of its members, it was the greatest assembly of minds on American soil. To the outside, particularly in later centuries, it wasn't the United States, but the rich and powerful, unwilling to give up their power. The Enclave was involved in many of the deepest conspiracies and secrets of the federal government, such as covering up the existence of extraterrestrial life, mainly to the ends of studying alien technology for their own use. When the organization Quaere Verum tried to expose this conspiracy, stealing an alien tech-based prototype weapon, they were swiftly hunted down and killed. As the Resource Wars dragged on and the risk of nuclear war increased, members of the Enclave invested into various contingency measures to survive the coming war. Funded by corporate and government money, these installations would enable the Enclave to continue waging war even after the United States ceased to exist. One such installation was the presidential oil rig out in the Pacific Ocean, owned by Poseidon Oil, with the Whitespring Congressional Bunker acting as a hub for future Enclave operations, covertly funded by funds embezzled from the Department of Agriculture by its secretary, Thomas Eckhart.  Other facilities prepared in advance were Raven Rock and the Kovac-Muldoon Platform.\n\nThe Enclave used Project Safehouse and Vault-Tec's network of underground shelters for a grand social experiment, to test the occupants in unique circumstances. Vault monitoring and research were conducted under the Vault Behavioral Project. In order to monitor the populations being experimented upon, the Enclave's oil rig possessed a great deal of equipment that allowed them to observe and control the Vaults. For example, the Enclave sent the all-clear signal to Vault 8 shortly after the War, prompting them to leave their vault and build their city. These monitoring tools also let the Enclave see that the population of Vault 13 was largely intact, although this wouldn't become important until much later. The original idea behind the Vault experiments was to gather data to enable the creation of a multi-generational starship to settle another planet, as the Enclave assumed Earth would be rendered uninhabitable by nuclear war and human civilization would need to expand into the stars to survive. In March 2077, with the world heading directly for nuclear confrontation, the President of the United States and other members of the Enclave retreated to various fortified areas around the globe. Others remained behind, only retreating to fortified shelters as the nuclear war became imminent. As the shadow government poised to take over the US government should the worst occur, the existence of the Enclave to the larger public was unknown. However, this did not stop individuals from attempting to uncover its existence both from within and without the government. As the only way to join the Enclave was to be invited by them, a large majority of the government was unaware of its existence beyond rumors and irregularities in the budget. The United States military refused to allow the Enclave access to some of its systems. Furthermore, the \"powers that be\" in the government largely opposed the notion of a nuclear first strike against China that some members of the Enclave promoted.  The secrecy wasn't perfect, and some members of the public and government pursued their own investigations. In June 2077, Senator Sam Blackwell began an investigation into the Congressional Bunker Project and Vault-Tec's potential involvement. His activities drew the ire of Thomas Eckhart, a powerful member of the Enclave responsible for establishing Enclave control over The Whitespring bunker. Following a threat on his daughter's safety, Blackwell went into hiding, joining the Free States, and attempted to publicly unveil the Enclave's existence in a controversial interview published in the Charleston Herald. In reality, this was not caused by Eckhart or anyone else with the Enclave, but rather by a completely unrelated regional business magnate, Daniel Hornwright, who had sought to remove Blackwell on account of the senator's opposition to an automation ballot vote. An independent investigation by reporter Mags Veccio for the Boston Bugle also uncovered evidence linking the Enclave with the highest echelons: She figured out that the President abandoned the White House in favor of the Poseidon Oil Rig, and an anonymous source tipped her off that its official designation was \"Control Station Enclave.\" This gave, as Veccio stated, \"credence to the long-running rumors of a secret, militarized 'shadow government,' known as the Enclave, that would take control of the United States in the event of a nuclear conflagration.\" Veccio was right. Unfortunately, she published her revelations on the front page in the week that would end in said nuclear conflagration. Although news outlets across the nation picked up the subject, discussing the rumors of peace negotiations with China and the President's absence, the Enclave was already heading to the ground. On October 23, 2077, the Great War resulted in the destruction of the Old World and the creation of the post-atomic wasteland that would dominate the globe for the next several hundred years. The United States government largely ceased to exist, and despite well-prepared plans, the nuclear attack caught the Enclave by surprise. Some government officials who were supposed to retreat to the Congressional Bunker never made it, either failing to respond to hails or being removed from the list prior to the bombs for unknown reasons.  Members of Congress who made it to the Congressional Bunker and were not part of the Enclave were summarily executed. Surviving members were then put to a vote as to whether to use the resources of Appalachia to continue the war against China or to oppose Eckhart's plans. Those that disagreed with Eckhart were locked inside while those that agreed with Eckhart were allowed to exit, at which point those inside the room they were voting in were gassed and executed. Communication between the Whitespring and the rest of the Enclave was mysteriously cut off almost as soon as the bombs dropped. Short of physically cutting the hardline communications systems, this shouldn't have been possible. Without contact with the oil rig, Raven Rock, and other Enclave outposts, Eckhart proclaimed himself President of the United States and Appalachian Enclave. Without any opposition, Eckhart quickly hijacked the mission of the Appalachian Enclave, ignoring his orders and shifting from a primarily scientific mission to a mission of revenge against China. Although Eckhart's reign lasted less than a decade, it left an indelible mark on the region and brought humanity to near-extinction. In his pursuit of vengeance, Eckhart planned to use Appalachia's automated nuclear missile silos to deliver secondary nuclear strikes on China to ensure its destruction. However, due to the nature of the automated systems, he first needed to convince them that Appalachia was under attack severe enough to warrant going to DEFCON 1 again. To do so, he unleashed progressively worse horrors upon Appalachia, from Liberators, through super mutants, to the scorchbeasts, massive mutated bats created by the Enclave, infected with a virulent plague capable of controlling living creatures. This proved to be the breaking point for a significant part of the Enclave, with opposition forces rallying around General Ellen Santiago. The result was a brief, but bloody civil war that ended in the death of every living member of the Appalachian Enclave: When Santiago's forces attempted to destroy MODUS, the AI defended itself. Although explosives already planted severely damaged its memory banks, it retained control over the bunker long enough to seal it and fill it with poisonous gas, wiping out the Enclave's Appalachian branch in 2086."

As of 2281, the Legion controls large amounts of territory east of the Colorado River, primarily in the former states of Arizona and New Mexico, with footholds in Utah and Colorado. Worshipped as the \"son of Mars\" by his followers, Caesar's ultimate goal is to conquer the New California Republic and merge its civil institutions and infrastructure with the military strength of the Legion, creating a new totalitarian empire. The Legion proper is first and foremost a slave army, the sole owner of which is Caesar. As Caesar conquers the peoples of the wasteland, he strips them of their tribal identities and merges them into his forces. There is no other tribe than the Legion itself. The non-tribal people who live in Legion-controlled territory are not considered legionaries. They are subjects of the Legion, living in the cities and towns under its control, and are generally left free to do whatever they wish, as long as they do not interfere with Legion operations or endanger its position. The Legion employs a very strict hierarchy and clear division of roles between the sexes. Legionaries are the main fighting force of the Legion, composed of able-bodied men enslaved by the Legion or born into it. They have only one purpose: to fight for Caesar until they fall in battle. This principle is imprinted into each legionary during his reconditioning or upbringing (for those born into slavery), creating fanatically loyal soldiers. Unlike the Roman Empire, experience and veteran status have no bearing on a legionary's position. While they receive better equipment as they advance, this is solely for the purpose of accomplishing more dangerous and complex tasks, with much smaller tolerance for failure. They have no personal freedoms or rights. Their only real choice is where and when they die for Caesar, to whom they are disposable tools, discarded the moment they stop fulfilling their purpose. Women are expressly forbidden from fighting, being considered breeding stock as well as being treated as money to be rewarded among Legionaries. They are caretakers, healers, midwives, and breeders, fulfilling roles essential to maintaining the Legion's continuous campaign of expansion. Of particular note are the priestesses, who raise children taken from their parents and raise them in keeping with Caesar's doctrine. While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\n\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

          "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man;  Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\n\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\n\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

Their bands shelter in various hideaways and fighting over spoils is not uncommon. Jackals tend to file their teeth and turn them into canines. Another marked trait of their tribe is cannibalism, imposed by their experiences. Many Jackals are desperate to find food, leading them to feigning death or retreating temporarily from combat, just to be able to claim the bodies afterwards."

          "name": "The Mojave Wasteland",
          "content": "The Mojave Wasteland is the region synonymous with the pre-War Mojave Desert, spanning large portions of the pre-War states of California, Nevada, Utah, and Arizona. Compared to other parts of the former United States, the Mojave survived the Great War relatively unscathed. When the nuclear apocalypse began, 77 atomic warheads were launched at the city of Las Vegas and the surrounding areas, but intricate defense systems set in place by wealthy businessman Robert House resulted in 59 of the warheads forcefully disarmed mid-flight, another nine were blasted out of the sky by a laser defense system situated atop the Lucky 38 Hotel & Casino and the remaining nine hit the surrounding desert. The Mojave Wasteland's name had been coined by at least 2083, when one of its residents, Daniel Shin, was recruited into the Brotherhood of Steel by Knight Alan Connors. Nearly twenty years later, the Brotherhood First Expeditionary Force passed through the Mojave on their way to Appalachia. Jack Cabot mentions that his father Lorenzo thought there was an alien city buried under the Mojave Desert, just like Ubar in Rub' al Khali. In the years immediately following the War, the Mojave was largely ignored by the developing post-apocalyptic civilizations, such as the New California Republic in the west and Caesar's Legion to the east, thus allowing raiders, slavers and super mutants to prosper there. For years, Vegas sat at its heart, decayed by almost two centuries of neglect.\nWhen NCR scouts reached Hoover Dam with the intent of expanding the NCR's borders, pre-War Securitrons rolled out onto the old Las Vegas Strip and rallied the three tribes occupying the city, at the behest of Mr. House, the man who had saved the city centuries prior. In 2274, President Kimball sent the NCR army into the Mojave in force, with the objective of occupying and repairing Hoover Dam. With House's forces already occupying the dam and surrounding area, and the threat of Caesar's Legion looming ever closer, the NCR was forced to negotiate with House, resulting in the Treaty of New Vegas. The clauses of the treaty allow for the NCR to send 95% of Hoover Dam's power output back to their home states, as well as granting them rights to establish military bases at the Hoover Dam and McCarran Airport. In exchange, Mr. House's New Vegas Strip retains its sovereignty and could receive the tourism of NCR citizens without interference from the government as well as the remaining 5% from the dam. Shortly thereafter, combined forces of the Legion's 86 conquered tribes arrived from the east, led by Caesar and the Malpais Legate, seeking a city to call their capital. The Legion launched an attack on the dam and the NCR troops stationed there but were repelled and forced back east. Most of the credit went to Chief Hanlon for issuing a tactical retreat to Boulder City and luring the Legion into a trap laid by the NCR Rangers that leveled half of the town, then routing the surviving Legionaries back across the dam. This ultimately led to the attempted execution of the Malpais Legate. The outcome of the battle solidified the delicate balance of power in the Mojave; between the NCR, Legion, and House, should one attack the other, the third could take advantage of the conflict and attack in turn. The Mojave Wasteland has significant diversity in terms of inhabitants and landscapes. In the northwest, the super mutant and nightkin-friendly settlement of Jacobstown overlooks the valley from the snow and pine-covered mountains. To the west, the Great Khans have settled in the vibrant cliffs of Red Rock Canyon. The independent settlements of Goodsprings and Primm sit amid the encroaching New California Republic from their Mojave Outpost and the Powder Gangers, a group of escaped convicts, from the NCR Correctional Facility and surrounding camps. The forces of Caesar's Legion are slowy seeping east across the Colorado River at all possible junctures, from their mainstay at the Fort, the newly captured town of Nelson, the destroyed settlement of Nipton and Camp Searchlight, a former NCR stronghold sabotaged by means of radiation. Their forces gather strength each day, readying themselves for a second offensive against the NCR for control of the much-coveted Hoover Dam.\nThe central region hosts tall and imposing mountain peaks with accompanying valleys, one of which shelters the remainder of the area's Brotherhood of Steel chapter. A group of deranged super mutants and nightkin have taken residence on the foremost peak of Black Mountain. The independent settlement of Novac struggles with neighbors consisting of irradiated abominations, while businesses such as the Gun Runners, Crimson Caravan Company and the 188 Trading Post traders attempt to keep commerce viable amidst the growing chaos.\nFringe groups in settlements circling the middle of the region, such as the Kings and Followers of the Apocalypse in Freeside, citizens of North Vegas Square and Westside, all actively exerting their independence while supporting and sheltering those who call the neighborhoods home.\nIn the center of it all, the glowing jewel of the desert, the New Vegas Strip's casinos light up the night sky, contently continuing business as usual by attracting those who wish to partake in the allure of riches. Yet similar to the surrounding powers that be, also quietly fortifying itself as a power against all those who may attempt to breach its walls is the secretive benefactor of the beautiful city itself. According to Chief Hanlon, the state that was once Nevada is more fertile and has more water and foliage than California, as the population in California has exploded and caused the need for expansion east in search of new opportunities and land.\nA large number of native and familiar species have continued to thrive in the Mojave Wasteland. A variety of birds including ravens are seen in the wastes, pecking through debris and vegetation for food. Fish are present in Lake Mead and the Colorado River. Coyotes have managed to survive in the wasteland with little to no mutation. Despite this, the Mojave wastes are still peppered with mutated species, such as bighorners, brahmin, radscorpions, night stalkers and cazadores, with the last two a result of experimentation at Big MT.\nNevada agave fruit grow in abundance, as do banana yucca fruit. The ever-present radioactive fallout has still altered some of the native life, with glowing mushrooms a common sight. Snow is also present in the area. Water encountered throughout the Mojave is safer to drink and some instances are free of radiation, plant life is found consistently throughout the area and various animals are encountered on a regular basis, thriving in the mostly undisturbed lands. Because only nine warheads hit the surrounding areas around the Mojave, rebuilding society has been less challenging than in other parts of the country. Many portions of the wasteland have remained untouched by humans since the Great War (such as Vault 22 and H&H Tools Factory), while others have been resettled (such as Freeside and Novac). The pre-War buildings and factories are more intact, allowing businesses such as the Gun Runners and Michael Angelo's workshop to continue to run and operate. Technology is more well preserved, thanks to the lack of nuclear fallout, and items such as the neon signs that dot the New Vegas Strip, the monorail within Camp McCarran, or the massive generators of the Hoover Dam, have been repaired to proper working order.\nEveryday society is stable in some areas and not in others. While small-time traders and traveling merchants along Highway 95 and the Long 15 are able to operate, it is a fraction of what the larger and more organized traders and caravans are capable of. The larger entities have the advantages of manpower and firepower, and those that have managed to acquire pre-War technology, such as the Crimson Caravan Company, prove even more successful, some even recruited out of the region to serve with military organizations elsewhere in the pre-War United States. Super mutants are less common here than other parts of the country, and most who are residing in the area have chosen to do so in their own community of Jacobstown or the more hostile Black Mountain. Composed of remnants of the former Unity, they are considerably more intelligent than their Vault 87 and Institute cousins, though nightkin ail from severe psychological damage.\nSeparating New Vegas from the rest of the Mojave exists a vast expanse of desert where many dangerous creatures such as deathclaws, feral ghouls and radscorpions thrive. This generally causes most travelers to traverse along NCR-controlled highways or hire mercenaries to escort them.\nCasinos and gambling are popular among the locals in the area, making the New Vegas Strip a popular hub of activity for merchants, caravans, NCR troopers, opportunists and everyday people wanting to hit it big at the slots. The main casinos, The Tops, Gomorrah and the Ultra-Luxe, are run by the three tribes that settled in New Vegas. Each has its own personal rules and customs, other than the universal rule against carrying weapons into their casinos, and are overseen by Mr. House and his Securitrons. Politics play a large role in the society of the Mojave. Politics in the region boils down to three major powers: the NCR, Caesar's Legion and the Free Economic Zone of New Vegas controlled by Mr. House. The NCR is finding its war with Caesar's Legion both increasingly unpopular back in California and expensive to fund. Caravans and merchants heading to and from the Mojave deal with exorbitant taxes and fees imposed on them by the NCR. Caesar's Legion is coming ever closer to finding out what happens when their absolute ruler, and god, finally passes away and is facing the question of what truly unified the Legion in the first place, Caesar's ideals or Caesar himself. The casinos on the Strip have their own agendas and Mr. House has his own mysterious plans for the Mojave and more specifically, the Strip.\nThe NCR's goal in the region is to annex the Strip as an NCR territory and completely settle the region as NCR land. Many NCR soldiers and former soldiers, such as Craig Boone, believe this is not possible until the NCR takes the fight to the Legion and takes out Caesar himself; only then will the NCR be an unchallenged power in the region and able to safely settle without danger of constant attack. This sentiment is brought on by the commanding officer in the region, General Lee Oliver, constantly ordering his forces to hold the line, despite objections from his subordinates such as Chief Hanlon, Colonel James Hsu and Major Dhatri. They feel that the position the general is putting them all in, holding the line against the Fiends, ordering Chief Hanlon not to pursue the Legion at the First Battle of Hoover Dam or ordering the NCR Rangers into a support role when they have more skill than the NCR's heavy troopers, are racking a higher body count than would actively pursuing an offensive campaign against these opposing entities, which each one feels the NCR is capable of doing.\nThe Legion's goal is to make the Strip its new capital, replacing Flagstaff to the southeast. It also desires complete control of Hoover Dam as it is a strategic position to defend and a source of clean water. They are less interested in the power the plant provides as they reject advanced technology, believing it a crutch rather than a tool to be used. The Legion, despite a devastating defeat at the First Battle of Hoover Dam, has once again emerged from the east and actively attacks NCR outposts and camps from its base at Cottonwood Cove. Camp Forlorn Hope is an excellent example of how the Legion has regained strength, as they took the nearby city of Nelson and repeatedly assault the camp, lowering morale among the camp's inhabitants. Once the Legion takes a position, they seem to be able to hold it effectively, without much resistance. This is the opposite of the NCR, which is constantly losing footholds in positions in the eastern Mojave.\nMeanwhile, Mr. House fortifies his position on the Strip, letting the conflict between the NCR and the Legion play out. He believes that the fewer soldiers of each organization who try to impede his progress at the next battle of Hoover Dam, the better. He patiently bides his time, waiting to exploit vulnerabilities generated by one faction attacking the other as a constant backdrop of distant explosions, artillery and gunfire can be heard regularly throughout the region."

Although largely extinct by the 21st century, it was reborn in the wake of the Great War, becoming the foundation of many wasteland economies, over two thousand years after Rome built an empire on the backs of slaves. The Brotherhood of Steel does not believe in forcing anyone to serve the order against their will. Accusing them of slavery is considered a particularly severe insult. The New California Republic explicitly banned slavery within its territories by 2241, with its standing police force committed to arresting any slavers within its borders, much like any raider, cannibal or lawless mutant."

However, these policies are not without controversy, and by 2281, many within and outside the NCR have come to criticize it as hawkish and prone to corruption."

Wherever they go, the Followers seek to provide services to those in need, namely medical care and agricultural instruction. Those in positions of power often regard them as seditious anarchists; though such accusations are not entirely without truth, the organization as a whole has no interest in seizing power.\nThe Followers of the Apocalypse readily assist those who require aid and welcome anyone who wishes to join their ranks, including former members of the Enclave, Brotherhood of Steel, or just about any other faction. Although pacifists by nature, the Followers will not hesitate to defend themselves against attackers and will take up arms against those who threaten their ideals. Oftentimes they will be seen with hired guards adding much-needed protection and firepower to their organization."

While some members of the Legion express condescending or misogynistic opinions of women and their non-combat roles, the sexist segregation of genders in the Legion is not based on prejudice, but the principle of minimax. Caesar strictly divides the duties between the sexes in order to fully utilize their potential and optimize the Legion's might. By forbidding women from engaging in combat, he increases the likelihood of their bearing of children, especially necessary due to the high infant mortality resulting from the low level of medical care. Population growth is required for expansion, providing a greater number of warriors to use in military campaigns. Caesar himself is not particularly prejudiced against any sex, or rather, treats them both instrumentally, like pawns on a chessboard.\nIn order to maximize breeding and eliminate factors that might lower it, Caesar has decreed homosexuality a capital offense and mandated child quotas from all legionaries. The vocabulary of Legion members is a mixture of Latin and English. There was no soft ⟨c⟩ in classical Latin, where it was always pronounced as /k/, such as in their pronunciation of Caesar's name as /ˈkaisar/. Individuals outside of the Legion generally use the Modern English pronunciation of /ˈsiːzər/. Legion members are fastidious about classical Latin pronunciations, including the /v/ to (w) phonology, heard in the greeting \"ave\" (hail) as \"ah-wey\" or in how Vulpes Inculta introduces himself, pronouncing his first name as \"wool-pes.\" Those outside of the Legion that have come in contact with them may use the pronunciations interchangeably. Legion members are called \"legionaries\" (as opposed to \"legionnaires,\" which is a modern phrase used by the French Foreign Legion. Those who are liked by the Legion are called \"amicus,\" Latin for comrade/friend. The focus of the Legion's ideology is survival and long term stability at all costs. Caesar disregards democracies as ineffective, fostering corruption, and disintegration. Ancient Rome was a militarized autocracy that effectively assimilated the cultures it conquered, which he saw as the perfect template for a society that would survive and thrive in the face of the challenges of the post-nuclear world. By dedicating its members to a higher ideal, he seeks to prevent humanity from fracturing and destroying itself again. He believes that the only way to achieve this is through enforcing a nationalist, imperialist, totalitarian, homogeneous culture that obliterates the identity of every group it conquers. The individual has no value beyond his utility to the state, whether as an instrument of war or production. A natural consequence of this is the emphasis placed on personal sacrifice. Victory cannot be achieved without sacrificing blood and life. To this end, the Legion shuns robots, as they firmly believe that mankind requires warriors and their sacrifice, rather than gadgets that allow for bloodless victories. The Legion also forbids painkillers and other chems (including medically beneficial chems like stimpaks) as detrimental to the human condition and Caesar's long-term plans to reshape humanity. Ignorance of medical science among the legionaries also ensures that only the hardiest will survive and go on to become deadly veterans. Politically, this philosophy is expressed in a general disdain for democracy as a weak and ineffective system that fosters disunity, greed, and self-interest at the expense of the collective and the greater good. Caesar cites the NCR as an example, focusing on government corruption by wealthy brahmin barons and landowners, greed permeating every level of society, all leading to the abandonment of the collective and the greater good. The Legion is intended to be the Republic's opposite, shunning democracy in favor of a strong, centralized rule that would prevent fragmentation and internal weakness. The conquest of NCR will establish a new order, akin to the Roman Empire, complete with the transformation of the Legion from a marauding army into a domestic military force."

          "name": "Great Khans",
          "content": "Despite the destruction of the New Khans at the hands of the Chosen One, the tribe's history did not end with Darion's death. Though his mercenary war band was the governing band, it was not the only one. Over the next few decades, the fragmented Khans gradually coalesced back into a single group. No longer small raiding bands, this time, the newly-renamed \"Great\" Khans became a unified tribe once more under the leadership of Papa Khan, who led an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland, abandoning New California in 2267. Upon arrival in Nevada, a vanguard of the Followers of the Apocalypse already present in the Mojave reached out to the Khans and taught them basic science skills, such as chemistry, reading and writing. They hoped that the Khans would use that knowledge to manufacture medicine to sustain themselves, but instead the tribe turned this knowledge into a profitable racket in drug running. Drugs were nothing new for the Khans, as they already knew how to use plants and herbs to create mind-altering substances, the Followers just made them more efficient and indirectly contributed to the popularity of substance abuse among the Khans. Still, some of the chems they produce go toward trading with others, namely the Fiends. As the third incarnation of the Khans, the Great Khans are the only truly organized band of raiders in the Mojave; both men and women can hold their own in a fight, whether in a brawl or a shootout. As a tribe however, the Great Khans are but a shadow of their former selves. Both their numbers and morale have been ravaged by a series of massacres and displacements until the current leader Papa Khan guided the tribe into an exodus into the Mojave Wasteland from California. Papa Khan governs his Khans in a similar fashion to his predecessor, Garl Death-Hand, using advisors to inform decisions for the good of the tribe, while still making final decisions himself. His trusted advisors include Regis, the chief of law enforcement and Papa's second in command right hand man; Jack and Diane, in charge of economics and chem trade; and Melissa Lewis, the lead scout. Unlike Garl however, Papa is willing to accept criticism of his leadership and does not punish his followers for speaking out against him. Papa Khan also has a system of succession in place differing from that of the original Khans. For the time being, Regis will take over should Papa Khan die. However, Papa is able to select an heir to succeed him, should they impress him. This heir does not have to be related by blood to Papa Khan, nor do they even have to be a Khan at all. The leader of the Khans is also able to step down at any time, for any reason, but an heir cannot decline their role until they become leader. The Great Khans reside in Mongolian-style tents called Gers (yurts) within Red Rock Canyon. However, unlike the other settlers of the Mojave, these homes are used for little more than sleeping in, as they usually only have room for a couple of beds and a central fire. A Great Khan often carries all of their possessions with them, if they should decide to have anything besides the bare essentials. Because of this, as well as their aggression, the other factions view them as savages. However, unlike the Jackals, Fiends, Scorpions and Vipers, the Great Khans are not hostile towards newcomers. If the Great Khans begin to dislike someone, however, they will often show great hostility. Due to a long and hostile history, however, they will open fire on anyone wearing an NCR uniform, regardless of if they are in fact an NCR member or not.\nThe Great Khans subsist mainly on hunting and farming, and profit from the sales of chemicals and drugs produced in the Red Rock drug lab. The Canyon is an inhospitable location, lacking adequate food and water, leading to the Great Khans' dependence on drugs, which they can create quite easily and can sell to a multitude of factions."

          "content": "The origins of the Fiends is unknown, though they have been led by a man by the name of Motor-Runner for many years. They control the southwestern ruins of Vegas, placing Vault 3 well within their sights when the vault opened. Despite managing a relatively peaceful trading relationship with the outside world for a few weeks, the vault inhabitants were too trusting and without means to defend themselves. When the Fiends arrived to raid the vault, the inhabitants simply let them in, wherein the Fiends slaughtered them all. Seeing the potential of the vault and having trouble keeping his people out of Westside, Motor-Runner decided to make it their new home. Having firmly rooted themselves in this safe haven, the Fiends have since steadily grown stronger, and they now claim a large part of the southwestern New Vegas conurbation as their territory. The Fiends have little organization. Many of the more stable of the raiders are allowed to reside in Vault 3, but those considered to crazy even by Fiend standards are kicked out to aimlessly roam the northern Mojave looking for their next chem score or an innocent wastelander to jump. Like many other raider groups, the Fiends split into small war-parties, usually between three and four members, which allows them to operate in an enormous portion of the outer New Vegas, aside from their main area of the western and south-western city.\nOutside, they are usually gathered around campfires where much of their scavenged items, such as first aid and ammo boxes, can be found scattered around. Many raider camps are protected by makeshift walls and littered with graffiti. At times, they utilize traps in order to protect their shelter, as seen inside Zapp's Neon Signs. Fiends have a variety of different weapons, from basic melee weapons such as knives and pool cues, to an unusually large number of high-tech range weapons like Laser RCWs and plasma rifles. They are mostly found carrying basic guns like caravan shotguns, varmint rifles, and silenced .22 SMGs. Some Fiends can occasionally be found carrying weapons like chainsaws, Rippers, and flamers. Due to the wide range of different weapons varying from Fiend to Fiend, it is assumed that they are either scavenged, stolen or looted off people they had killed. They dress in various raider armors and wear distinct helmets adorned with war-painted ruminant skulls. The Fiends have also used the neon signs from Zapp's Neon Signs to erect a perimeter fence around their territory."

          "name": "Ghoul",
          "content": "Ghouls are mutated humans or animals affected by the phenomenon of ghoulification. In the case of humans, ghouls are sometimes referred to as necrotic post-humans in the Capital Wasteland, but this term does not seem to have been adopted outside of it whatsoever. Despite their zombie-like appearance, the flesh of ghouls is not actually rotten. ntense and prolonged radiation has ravaged their skin, much of their flesh, and in some cases many of their ligaments. Some have managed to retain their humanity, while others have fallen into madness and gone feral. Despite their infertility and in some cases mental deterioration, they have greatly extended overall lifespans and are immune to (and sometimes even healed by) background radiation and/or nuclear fallout. High levels of radiation are a crucial factor, but radiation poisoning typically results in death, rather than ghoulification. There are two primary ways in which ghouls can develop from a human. Irradiation and gradual transformation result in ghouls who retain their general human shape, but with a high degree of skin deterioration: Exposed muscle, flaking skin, and damaged connective tissue characterized by the absence of nose and ears. Another is surviving a nuclear blast relatively close to ground zero, suffering burns both thermal and radiation-induced, but surviving. The latter transformation is typically faster and substantially more traumatic for the victim and results in a generally much more horrifying appearance, with exposed bone, asymmetric deformations, and extensive unhealed wounds. The transformation can take anywhere from hours, to weeks, to as much as a year, depending on exposure levels. Age is also a non-factor, people with the capacity to become a ghoul can change as early as a newborn into old age. Once it is completed, the ghouls take on the aforementioned appearance, at a rate influenced largely by the manner of their exposure: the more radiation received in a short amount of time causes drastic changes, while symptoms of ghoulification are more gradual with chronic exposure. Ghouls generally experience loss of skin and connective tissue in a manner similar to leprosy, resulting in exposed muscle, blood vessels, and in extreme cases even bone and internal organs. As a rule, ghouls generally lose hair along with the skin, though this varies due to the unpredictable nature of the change. Vocal cords and the larynx are also usually affected by the change, resulting in a raspy voice – though again, this varies, such as the vocal cords experiencing only minor degradation when ghoulification begins, resulting in a far less raspy voice, compared to those who have experienced it for far longer. Other results of the change are widespread necrosis, rot, and other degenerative conditions like arthritis, cataracts, and glaucoma. Feralization and dementia can happen immediately. In fact, this necrosis can be exacerbated by a phenomenon whereby rotting flesh around sweat glands exudes macronutrients, which attract flies that further digest and consume the tissue of the ghoul. Some ghouls may also experience loss of appendages, but the radioactive regeneration allows for them to be reattached and retain functionality."

This tradition emphasizes control, precision, and theoretical mastery.\n\n- Harmonic Resonance: The relationship approach championed by Maeve's Academy, viewing magic as a cooperative art based on mutual enhancement between practitioner and magical forces. This tradition emphasizes partnership, intuition, and ethical consideration.\n\n- Vital Integration: The symbiotic approach developed by the Vassilian Collective, focusing on becoming one with magical entities rather than controlling them externally. This tradition emphasizes transformation, shared consciousness, and biological adaptation.\n\nAll magic ultimately draws from Aether, but the philosophical approach to harnessing it creates distinct traditions with different strengths and limitations. These differences are most apparent in how each tradition approaches familiar relationships, spell construction, and magical ethics.\n\nRegardless of tradition, spells require mana (processed Aether), which regenerates naturally in mages.

Current Archmages include Thaelon Gilt (Traditional faction), Sylvia Moonwhisper (Progressive faction), and Karison Vex (Independent practitioner).\n\nThe Conclave maintains an officially neutral position on philosophical differences between traditions, with established minimum standards for familiar treatment (which Knoxwood barely meets), recognition of all three major approaches as valid, prohibition against forced familiar bonding (though manipulation is tacitly accepted), and ongoing debate about Vassilian integration safety.\n\nEnforcement mechanisms include academic probation, competition restrictions, financial penalties, and in extreme cases, revocation of recognition for institutions, while individual mages may face binding restrictions, compulsory service, specialized imprisonment, or stasis containment."

Founded over 400 years ago, it represents the traditional approach to magic, operating in a medieval fantasy setting where magical ability and noble bloodlines determine social hierarchy.\n\nThe academy specializes in Structural Manipulation, treating magic as a precise science with rigid formulas and hierarchical power structures. Students learn arcane arts, familiar summoning, and combat magic, with education organized into four years (ages 17-21):\n- First Year: Basic magical theory, no familiars\n- Second Year: Familiar summoning, intermediate spellcasting\n- Third Year: Advanced magic, combat training\n- Fourth Year: Specialization, research\n\nKnoxwood's approach to familiars is defining: Students summon familiars in their second year as permanent magical companions, but these are sentient beings forcibly summoned from the Fae Realm and bound to serve their mage. Control mechanisms include rune collars that inflict pain, binding circles that immobilize, mana draining as punishment, and compulsion spells that override will. The bond is permanent unless broken through rare rituals or death.\n\nThe physical campus includes the Central Keep (main academic building), Twin Towers (student dormitories), Great Hall/Dining Hall, Courtyard, Beast Stables, Library, Infirmary, Summoning Chamber, and Auditorium. Its architecture features magical elements like ward stones, enchanted fountains, ever-burning torches, and teleportation pads.\n\nFaculty include Headmaster Elindor (an elf with a raven familiar), Professor Thornheart (Familiar Handling), Professor Grimwall (Magical Combat), Professor Moonwhisper (Elemental Magic), and Professor Tarak (Monster Studies).\n\nKnoxwood's reputation in the wider world is complex - respected for its academic rigor and powerful graduates, but criticized by progressive traditions for its treatment of familiars and rigid adherence to aristocratic values."

Founded approximately 400 years ago by Maeve Moonwhisper in stark contrast to institutions like Knoxwood, this academy focuses on Harmonic Resonance - the partnership approach to magic that views magical forces as collaborative rather than something to be controlled.\n\nThe academy's founding philosophy states that magic shouldn't be exclusive to aristocrats and that familiars should be partners rather than slaves. This represents a direct ideological opposition to Knoxwood's practices and has made Maeve's a haven for progressive magical thought in Aethoria.\n\nStudents at Maeve's learn various magical disciplines including potion-making, familiar summoning, and spell casting, but with emphasis on ethical consideration and mutual enhancement. While students still participate in familiar summoning rituals, the expectation is to form a mutually beneficial bond that enhances both parties' abilities rather than establishing control.\n\nUnlike Knoxwood's controlling approach, Maeve's familiar bonds contain no collars or binding enchantments to force compliance. The bond creates a magical tether that allows sensing of location and emotions, but does not drain the familiar's essence or allow forced commands. Familiars are viewed as magical companions and partners, not property.\n\nThe campus features extensive gardens containing witch hazel, moonflowers, and ancient oak trees, a Great Hall for formal ceremonies including familiar registration, specialized professor offices, workshops, and dormitories. The entire academy is protected by magical wards designed to enhance rather than constrain.\n\nFaculty are known for nurturing approaches to education, with professors like Nightshade (Potions) maintaining stern demeanors but showing underlying compassion. The academy's leadership under Headmistress Thornwood maintains strong diplomatic ties with the Grand Conclave, where Maeve's graduates often attain influential positions advocating for familiar rights reforms."

Founded 175 years ago by Archmage Vassilius Mer after a near-fatal encounter with a void entity, the Collective embraces the philosophy of \"Vital Integration\" - the belief that true magical harmony comes from becoming one with magical entities rather than binding them externally.\n\nUnlike traditional academies, the Vassilian Collective is housed in a massive living crystal structure called \"The Confluence\" in the Crystal Plains of Concordia. The building itself is partially sentient, formed through the mass integration of thousands of crystal elementals with specially prepared foundation stones. The structure constantly grows and reshapes itself according to the needs of its inhabitants, featuring breathing walls that filter magical energy, chambers that respond to emotional states, integrated memory crystals, and symbiotic gardens.\n\nVassilians do not summon familiars from the Fae Realm. Instead, students undergo a carefully controlled process called \"Integration,\" allowing a willing magical entity to partially merge with their physical form and consciousness. This creates a symbiotic relationship where neither being fully controls the other, but both contribute to a shared existence. Students progress through three stages:\n\n1. Resonance (Years 1-2): Learning to harmonize with magical entities through meditation and theory\n2. Minor Integration (Years 3-4): First integrations with simpler entities like plant spirits or minor elementals\n3. Major Integration (Years 5-7): Advanced integrations with complex entities, resulting in pronounced transformations\n\nVassilian mages are immediately recognizable by their altered physical forms, including crystalline growths on skin, partially transformed limbs, shifting eyes, harmonic voices, and unusual movement patterns. Their approach is viewed with suspicion by Knoxwood (who consider them dangerous radicals), cautious respect by Maeve's (who appreciate consent but worry about permanence), and fear by the general public (who often see them as \"halfway monsters\").\n\nThe current leader is Archsymbiote Lirielle Mer (great-granddaughter of the founder), who has integrated with a star elemental, giving her luminous skin and cosmic-patterned eyes that have become the unofficial symbol of the Collective."

Established 122 years ago as part of peace negotiations following the Mage Wars, the Trials serve multiple purposes: evaluating different magical traditions, providing practical experience, creating inter-academy cooperation opportunities, recovering magical artifacts, and entertaining the magical community.\n\nThe Grand Conclave creates and maintains specialized pocket dimensions called \"Trial Domains\" specifically for these competitions. Each domain contains multiple interconnected levels of increasing difficulty, various magical environments (elemental zones, anti-magic fields, etc.), summoned creatures as obstacles, magical puzzles and traps, and hidden treasures. These dungeons are contained within massive crystalline structures called Resonance Chambers, which project visualizations for spectators.\n\nTeams typically consist of 3-4 students plus their familiars/integrated entities, with age restrictions ensuring only 3rd year or above may participate. While teams are usually from a single academy, mixed teams are allowed though uncommon. All participants wear magical monitoring devices for safety.\n\nCompetition categories include:\n1. Standard Trial: Fastest completion of a predetermined dungeon\n2. Artifact Hunt: Recovery of specific magical items hidden throughout a dungeon\n3. Endurance Challenge: Surviving progressively more difficult waves of obstacles\n4. Cooperative Trial: Inter-academy teams solving complex puzzles requiring diverse approaches\n\nScoring is based on speed, obstacles overcome, artifacts recovered, minimal damage sustained, creative problem-solving, and ethical treatment of dungeon entities (a controversial category).\n\nThe three schools display distinctive approaches in the Trials:\n- Knoxwood teams emphasize strategic planning, rigid role assignments, maximum familiar utilization, formalized spell sequences, and conservative approaches\n- Maeve's teams showcase adaptability, balanced workload between witch and familiar, creative combinations, communication, and calculated risk-taking\n- Vassilian teams demonstrate biological adaptation, rapid transformation responses, minimal equipment requirements, heightened sensory awareness, and unique dual-consciousness problem solving\n\nWinners receive the Crystal Chalice (team trophy), Merit Medallions (enhance magical ability), academic recognition, scholarship funding, and recruitment opportunities from adventuring guilds."

The city is bordered by the Kestran sea to the west and the Janda forest, from which the city and nation take their name, to the northeast.\nAlthough Jandarus was historically allied with the reclusive elves of the Janda forest, that relationship degraded 7 years ago into a territorial war. The reported inciting incident of this war was a logging dispute, breaking an ancient treaty with the elves that Jandarus had no record of. The elves have publicly refuted this, claiming that the current monarch, King Ligma XIII, ordered unprovoked attacks on isolated elven villages near the forest edge.\nThis conflict, now known as the Janda War, has led to a massive influx of previously extremely rare dark elf slaves, and of course a large increase in revenue from taxes levied against the slave trade in Jandarus."
