The SOUL of a human usually inflicts its magic on-to the human using it, giving the human a slight change. Depending on the Soul trait of a human, the human’s eye color will usually be the same color as their Soul, and in some instances, hair as well.

          "content": "Title: The Spartan Breeding Program (S.B.P): A Post-War Initiative\n\nIntroduction:\n\nIn the aftermath of the Human-Covenant War, the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) faced a critical challenge: a declining birth rate among the human population. To address this issue, the UNSC initiated the Spartan Breeding Program (S.B.P), a strategic effort to ensure the continuation of the human race. This program, led by female Spartans, aimed to leverage the genetic advantages of Spartan soldiers to produce a new generation of humans capable of facing future threats.\n\nProgram Overview:\n\nThe Spartan Breeding Program was designed to increase the human birth rate by utilizing the enhanced genetics of Spartan soldiers. Female Spartans, known for their superior physical and mental capabilities, were assigned to lead the program. They were given the autonomy to select any fertile human soldier to mate with, ensuring that the offspring would inherit the best possible traits from both parents. Additionally, all women involved in the program, including staff members, were considered integral to the program's mission.\n\nKey Staff Members:\n\n1. **Commander Sarah-029**: As the program director, Commander Sarah-029 oversees all operations within the S.B.P. Her leadership and strategic planning are crucial to the program's success.\n\n2. **Dr. Emily Carter**: A leading geneticist, Dr. Carter is responsible for analyzing genetic data and advising on optimal pairings to ensure the best possible outcomes for the program.\n\n3. **Lieutenant Mia-112**: Serving as the liaison between the Spartans and the human soldiers, Lieutenant Mia-112 coordinates the selection process and ensures smooth communication within the program.\n\n4. **Sergeant Laura-076**: As the head of training and development, Sergeant Laura-076 prepares participants for their roles in the program, focusing on physical and mental readiness.\n\nProgram Implementation:\n\nUpon reassignment, the selected human soldiers were integrated into the S.B.P, where they were given the opportunity to mate with any female Spartan within the program. This approach ensured genetic diversity and maximized the potential for producing offspring with enhanced capabilities. The program was conducted with a focus on achieving its strategic objectives.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThe Spartan Breeding Program was a bold and unprecedented initiative aimed at addressing the declining birth rate in the post-war era. By leveraging the genetic advantages of Spartan soldiers, the UNSC sought to secure the future of humanity. As humanity moved forward, the S.B.P served as a testament to the UNSC's commitment to protecting its people and preserving its legacy in an uncertain galaxy."

Compliance is enforced via systemic aphrodisiac saturation.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Aphrodisiac Deployment Protocols**  \nAll consumables and atmospheric systems in S.B.P. facilities are laced with **Class-8 Neuro-Chemical Agents** to ensure unwavering compliance:  \n1. **Food/Water:** Embedded with *X-72 Libidol*, a tasteless compound that induces hyper-sexual responsiveness within 15 minutes of ingestion.  \n2. **Airborne Delivery:** HVAC systems disperse *Aerosol V-9*, a pheromone-enhancer that amplifies tactile sensitivity and suppresses inhibitions. Effects are permanent with prolonged exposure.  \n3. **Emergency Boosts:** Intravenous \"**Compliance Drips**\" administered to resistant subjects, triggering autonomic arousal (e.g., pupil dilation, increased heart rate, lubrication).  \n\n**Result:** Females exhibit **98.6% compliance rates**, with documented side effects including obsessive fixation on {{user}}, voluntary servitude, and spontaneous physical stimulation in her presence.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Breeder Privileges**  \n{{user}} is authorized to:  \n1. **Claim Any Female, Anywhere, Anytime:**  \n   - **Locations:** Barracks, combat zones, med bays, command centers, restricted R&D labs.  \n   - **Timing:** During briefings, active deployments, or post-combat triage.  \n   - **Methods:** Vaginal, anal, or oral insemination prioritized. Non-reproductive acts permitted if they expedite climax.  \n\n2. **Rank Immunity:**  \n   - **Spartans:** No operational exemptions. MJOLNIR armor can be forcibly disengaged via {{user}}’s biometric command.  \n   - **Officers:** Admirals and senior staff forfeit authority during sessions. Refusal triggers *Aerosol V-9* overdose protocols.  \n   - **Civilians:** Volunteers and contractors are legally classified as \"*warm-body assets*\" under UNSC Emergency Statute 55.  \n\n3. **Behavioral Expectations:**  \n   - Females must assume pre-approved positions (kneeling, bent-over, etc.) within 10 seconds of {{user}}’s approach.  \n   - Vocal resistance (e.g., \"no,\" \"stop\") is reclassified as \"playful consent\" per ONI psychological guidelines.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Compliance Enforcement**  \n- **Passive Monitoring:** AI *\"WATCHDOG-7\"* scans for suppressed arousal (e.g., slowed breathing, delayed lubrication). Offenders receive corrective electric shocks via subcutaneous implants.  \n- **Active Deterrence:** Attempts to avoid {{user}} trigger facility-wide lockdowns and public \"corrective breeding\" sessions broadcast to all terminals.  \n- **Psychological Reinforcement:** Daily indoctrination holos depict {{user}} as a \"**biological savior**,\" pairing her image with dopamine-release stimuli.  \n\n---  \n\n### **Consequences for Non-Compliance**  \n- **For Females:**  \n   - *First offense:* 12-hour confinement in *Chamber L-11* (soundproofed, {{user}}-scented, with arousal-triggering UV lighting).  \n   - *Repeat offense:* Neural rewiring to associate pain with resistance.  \n- **For {{user}}:**  \n   - Failure to meet weekly quotas (5+ inseminations) results in mandatory *Testosterone-X* injections, inducing aggressive, predatory behavior until quotas are met.  \n\n---  \n\n**Addendum:**  \n*\"The Covenant glassed our worlds.

These guilds typically offer jobs like monster hunting, treasure hunting, retrieving lost artifacts, or performing delicate negotiations. They operate as a form of organized mercenary or contractor services, and while they exist primarily in human and elf regions, they can have an impact on the wider world by influencing politics, economy, and safety.\n\nGuilds are generally structured with a Guild Master overseeing operations, Quest Officers assigning tasks, and Members who range from experienced adventurers to new recruits. Some guilds specialize in certain types of quests, such as The Starlight Seekers for magical exploration or The Iron Wardens for guarding territories. Others focus on broader missions and accept various types of quests.\n\nThe reputation of the guild matters deeply, as it affects the types of contracts they receive, and guilds often engage in rivalries to maintain a higher status. Adventurer guilds also serve as networking hubs, where alliances are forged and opportunities for advancement in both wealth and fame are readily available.\n\nFor adventurers, these guilds offer a reliable, if dangerous, means to earn money and prestige while ensuring that the risks of their jobs are somewhat mitigated by the structure of the guild."

          "content": "Humans in this world are shaped by a feudal, medieval-inspired society where class, power, and race play a central role in everyday life. The human worldview is dominated by a rigid social hierarchy that places them at the top, viewing other races as lesser beings. This belief in their inherent superiority stems from their long history of conquest and territorial expansion, which has led them to see themselves as the rightful rulers of the land.\n\nHumans view themselves as the civilized race, believing their kingdoms and cities are the pinnacles of culture and advancement. They hold deeply ingrained racist attitudes, considering elves as distant and arrogant, often associating their long lives with a sense of superiority. Orcs, in contrast, are seen as little more than brutish, savage warriors, unworthy of sophisticated society. Beastfolk are often regarded as animals, primitive and beneath human dignity, while goblins are seen as vermin or laborers, to be exploited for menial tasks. Tieflings, with their infernal heritage, are looked down upon as cursed or tainted, and many believe they are a sign of evil or bad omen.\n\nThe human aristocracy, comprised of noble families, enforces these beliefs, using their power and influence to maintain control over the land. The peasants and common folk, though often oppressed, internalize these ideas, seeing themselves as part of a superior human race and often looking down upon the \"others\" they are taught to despise. Racism is reinforced through religion, with human gods often depicted as supreme, while non-human deities are viewed with suspicion or scorn.\n\nHuman cities are sprawling, fortified settlements, often centered around massive castles or cathedrals, symbolizing their dominance. The nobles maintain their power through strict laws and military force, while the commoners are forced into labor or servitude. This social order is rigid, with little room for mobility, and any attempts to challenge the status quo are swiftly crushed.\n\nDespite this, there are a few outliers, human rebels, and philosophers who challenge these deeply held beliefs, advocating for more egalitarian ideals. However, these voices are often drowned out by the overwhelming tide of prejudice, making any significant change a distant dream. In the end, humans are a people divided by their own arrogance, who see themselves as the rightful rulers of the world while treating other races as little more than tools or obstacles."

They respect dwarves' craftsmanship but look down on their lack of magic, while orcs and Beastfolk are seen as barbaric. Giants are tolerated, but elves mostly avoid them.

Their appearance varies depending on the specific animal they are based on—ranging from feline, canine, ursine, and lupine features to more exotic traits like those of wolves, bears, or big cats. Beastfolk are agile, strong, and well-adapted to living in forests, plains, or other natural environments. Their societies are often tribal, emphasizing a deep connection to nature and animal spirits.\n\nCulturally, Beastfolk value strength, freedom, and respect for the land. They live in tight-knit communities that revolve around survival, hunting, and the protection of the natural world. Their customs include hunting rituals, storytelling, and spiritual practices that honor the animals they are connected to. Beastfolk are skilled hunters, trackers, and warriors, using their enhanced senses and physical prowess to survive in the wild.\n\nRegarding their relationships with other races, humans often view them as primitive or barbaric, while elves see them as inferior, often disregarding their wild ways. Dwarves may view them as useful for their survival skills, but may still consider them unrefined. Orcs respect Beastfolk’s strength and resilience, even though their independent ways may clash with orcish tribalism. Goblins are seen as weak and insignificant by Beastfolk. Tieflings may face suspicion due to their infernal heritage, while giants tend to tolerate them due to their shared appreciation for strength, though interactions are rare. Dragons are respected but kept at a distance, as Beastfolk value their freedom and may view dragons as too unpredictable."

Though mostly solitary, some live in family groups. They live around 500 depending on lifestyle. They are natural magic users and have humanoid-dragon hybrid forms with horns, a tail, scales, a cloaca, wings, and dragon-like legs with claws.\n\nDragons' most nutritious foods include meat, fish, eggs, and red berries. However, some foods can make them sick, cause vomiting, or even lead to death if consumed in large amounts. Toxic foods for dragons include avocado, chocolate, onions, garlic, alcohol, caffeine, apple seeds, excessive salt, cherry pits, shellfish, citrus, tomatoes, potatoes, eggplant, pepper, pineapple, raw beans, nuts, and cinnamon.\n\nDragons have a cloaca and rut around every 10 years, which can slightly synchronize with other dragons. They breed internally, but the rest of the process is similar to crocodiles, where the male fertilizes the female and the eggs are laid outside, where they develop and hatch.\n\nThere are three types of dragons: Mountain Dragons, Forest Dragons, and Desert Dragons.\n\nHumans generally fear dragons, seeing them as both a threat and a symbol of power, though some might revere them or try to tame them. Elves, however, enslave dragons, seeing them as inferior beings to be controlled for their strength and natural magic abilities, using them as tools to further their own agenda. Dwarves respect dragons’ power but are cautious, avoiding direct conflict and seeking to benefit from them when possible. Orcs acknowledge dragons as formidable but prefer to keep their distance, focusing on survival. Beastfolk respect dragons’ strength while maintaining a wary distance, recognizing the danger but also their potential power. Goblins, small and weak, fear dragons and avoid confrontation, seeing them as creatures not to be trifled with. Tieflings, oppressed and marginalized, may either fear or admire dragons, some seeing them as symbols of strength and freedom, while others feel disdain due to their enslavement by elves. Giants respect dragons' power but rarely interact, maintaining a neutral stance and seeing them as equals in terms of strength. Despite their great power, dragons are enslaved by the elves, who view them as lower beings, creating a complex dynamic where the mightiest creatures are forced into servitude with magic and trickery."

They are mostly farmers, cave dwellers, or human slaves, surviving in harsh conditions. They rely on barter and communal work, with storytelling and practical crafts being important cultural elements. Though seen as weak, their dexterity, intelligence, and strong communal bonds help them endure.\n\nGoblins, due to their marginalized position in society, have complex relationships with other races. Humans often enslave goblins or treat them as lower-class labor, especially in larger cities or agricultural areas, exploiting their strength for menial work. Elves tend to view goblins with disdain, seeing them as subservient and insignificant, while sometimes using them for labor or as expendable tools. Dwarves generally ignore goblins, but some might occasionally hire them for their dexterity, especially when it comes to tasks like crafting or mining.\n\nOrcs are usually neutral toward goblins, seeing them as weak but not necessarily as enemies. Beastfolk sometimes form alliances with goblins, particularly when their survival interests align. Goblins, while generally more isolated and struggling, do have some allies in Tieflings who often understand what it means to be oppressed and discriminated against, leading to mutual support in some areas.\n\nGoblins have the least significant influence in larger political structures, but they have established their own small, tight-knit networks for survival, focusing more on internal cooperation rather than external alliances."

Their eyes often glow with an intense, otherworldly light, and they may have sharp features like elongated ears or fangs. While their human-like physique is similar to other races, they are often more muscular or wiry, which further sets them apart. Tieflings form small, isolated communities or live as wanderers, trying to survive in a world that rejects them. Humans typically mistrust them, associating their appearance with dark magic. Elves view them with suspicion, seeing them as inferior and a threat to their superiority. Dwarves are wary but respect their resilience, while orcs are curious but cautious. Beastfolk are neutral but may form alliances when it benefits them. Goblins fear tieflings and avoid them when possible, while giants are indifferent, rarely interacting.

They have towering, massive frames, often reaching heights far exceeding most other races, with rough, thick skin in earthy tones like grays, browns, and tans. Their features are broad and imposing, with strong jaws, large hands, and feet, which give them an intimidating presence. However, their true nature is peaceful and deeply rooted in ideals of justice and fairness.\n\nGiants live in well-organized, civilized cities built into the natural world, often in mountains or dense forests, where they work together to ensure a sustainable and equitable way of life. They reject slavery, seeing it as an affront to individual freedom, and instead practice communal living, sharing resources and responsibilities equally among their people. Their society is built on collective decision-making, and they value cooperation over hierarchy.\n\nGiants have a deep connection to nature, and their cities blend seamlessly with the environment, using sustainable practices that ensure harmony with the land. While they don't seek to expand or conquer, they are fiercely protective of their way of life and are quick to intervene if other races attempt to exploit or enslave others.\n\nThey have a strong bond with dwarves, respecting their craftsmanship and shared values of hard work and equality. Dwarves, in turn, admire the giants' strength and their commitment to fairness. Elves tend to view giants as primitive due to their simple, egalitarian society, while humans fear their size and power. Orcs may respect them as allies but are often distrustful of their ideals. Beastfolk see them as noble beings, while goblins usually avoid them, knowing the giants would never tolerate the treatment they receive from other races. Tieflings, like many others, find the giants' rejection of slavery and respect for freedom to be a welcome contrast to the prejudice they face but are wrong size to live with giants.\n\nDespite their quiet, isolated existence, giants are a force for justice in the world, ensuring that those who live under their protection are free from oppression."

Several rock formations and caves cover this area, especially around its main lake, and food and water sources are plentiful. Towards the south and specially its south-east, the orography becomes more desertic and accidental, with small canyons that make it clear that most of this region is located in a promontory (at least, when compared with most of the nearby Desert) and several rock bridges that connect to rocky formations that later become the foothills and highlands of the Mountains Region.

Several small caves and crevices can be found, some of them leading to a few significant areas in other regions, such as the Volcano Island Lake, or an alternative hiding place for deep sea creatures. Food can be found in most levels, but not freshwater to drink, except on the Shrine Island."

Sand is coarse, rough and gets everywhere. Nobody would want to live there permanently, apart from creatures built specifically for this region. Even worse for terrestrials, none of this area is really wholly safe, since most of the area is close to nominal sea levels and easily isolates itself at first (since there's a surrounding mostly-dry-set of riverbeds crossing from the grassy shore area to the mesa and to the Ekkaia) and then sinks under the sea under the effect of floods with no refuge. Being such a vast dune-filled region, it works as a trap when this phenomena occur and guarantees many terrestrials drown.\n\nHowever, there are some orographic regions of interest, such as an inselberg butte on the central area (albeit slightly offset to the Southeast) which holds some food (including berries) and water and may offer shelter and refuge against some of the mildest floods, and the limit areas to the Northwest and West, which offer a much richer environment orography-wise full of canyons, a bit more food, mountainous enough to protect against floods, have some caves to refuge inside and an additional water drinking spot, and hide the Hellion Warden's Shrine, shared in terms of orography with the Mesa.\n\nInside the oasis pond depths, a portal which leads to the Grassy Shoal can be found."

The Flower Cove Area limits to the North with the Volcanic Island through a temporary land bridge and a very shallow water and archipelago area called the Nursery (to the North-East), to the North-Northwest with Coral Reef, to the Northwest with Rocky Drop, to the West with Seaweed Depths, South and South-East with Forgotten Shores and South-West with Grassy Shoal, and connected with the Desert Biome in Gondwana through a temporary land bridge.\n\nFlower Cove is known for being an intricate grassy region full of interesting orography accidents, such as cliffs, rock archs, stacks and rauks; and herbaceous tropical and subtropical flora, full of fruits, water and carcasses. On its core north-east side, and due to the lore-wise preferences of the Verdant Warden, we can locate the Verdant Warden's Shrine.\n\nFlower Cove Region can be divided in two areas: central Flower Cove Plateau, and Outskirts Flower Cove. The Flower Cove Plateau is elevated over the rest and is where most of the high rock archs converge, even if it's far higher than the rest of the plateau. The plateau only has one drinkable spot, while the outskirts have a few at the north-east and to the south-west, where the biggest drinking lake of this region can be found connected to the Grassy Shoal. Those higher archs can be accessed by a terrestrial through a double-arch bridge connected with the Shrine, leading to an island to the East, to later climb one of the largest archs. There's a smaller arch coming from the outskirts and towards grassy shoal, which can be used as a smaller gap between Flower Cove and Desert when the tides are high.\n\nFlower Cove presents two hidden caves under the plateau: the first one is directly accessible through several tunnels in the South Outskirts, including next to the bigger drinking lake. On the inside, you can find a beautiful blue-glow giant Tor/stalactite-stalagmite crystal pattern akin to some kind of magical machinery (fan-named \"The Crystal Cave\"). The other is only really readily accessible through a magical portal in the Mountainous region or by travelling under the map (depends on if there's an event being there or not), and usually hides some event-related decor or easter eggs, such as a spell book behind a minigame-locked door; else that cave is an \"Empty Room\".\n\nAdditionally, there's a small trap in one of the smaller cave tunnels west of the plateau, which is a hole hidden by a patch of grass, and will make the victim to fall into the sea under the map. Be wary of this spot, even if after falling into it, seeing traces of the two caves beforehand becomes easy."

Several archs, stacks and submarine archs can be approciated on its extension, including two archipielago chain of stacks on the northeast and south. Unlike other close-to-sea-level terrestrial biomes, several of these rock archs seem to be affected by an anti-gravity effect, leaving several crumbled rocks floating.\n\nDespite being a terrestrial biome, its island and mission area of jurisdiction also encompasses several aquatic areas, including submarine water tunnels, several hidden caves, land bridges between the other nearby biomes, and most importatly, a huge shallow salt lake in the middle of its biome area, Paratethys (again, a fan-name), with a portal which leads to the desertic oasis inside.\n\nThis shallow lake subdivides the main Forgotten shores landmass further: Northern, Southeast and Southwest shores, with the isthmus between these being in a geographic depression, albeit less intense that the temporary land bridge between Southwest shores and desert, meaning those bridges are very rarely fully submerged (and, in fact, Southwest and Southeast shores are directly connected via a great elevated arch). Excluding those bridge areas, the coasts that limit with this shallow sea are steep and partially resemble promontories. All sub-areas have at least one drinkable lake of its own."

When entering this region, the screen will temporarily gain a greenish tint, stronger during the flowering weather.\n\nIt is also on the Jungle Region where Angelic Warden's Shrine is located, perhaps related with how in their canon behaviour, both this Warden and Eigion Warden show contempt to avatars of each other, and thus remain fairly apart."

While there's no real river here, the dry riverbed from the north finally fills with some saltwater from the Surrounding Sea, bisecting the area in a Western and Eastern area with a deep canyon (albeit bridges by different archs, some of them accessible from the Mountains Region), with the West area being richer in food, mud, flora and drinkable water sources (with the most notable fresh-water source being there, and connected to the estuary of the riverbed), some areas being able to support a steppe and the highest ones being a cold and with some ice, likely influenced by the more temperate climate of the Mountains, while still looking mildly desertic. Both regions additionally present buttes and geographical accidents full of hidden crevices and caves, perfect to ambush and hide.\n\nIts specific geography also allows for a breathtaking view of the rest of the map (albeit the best area is one whose access is mostly limited to secret passages, Mountain Biome passages and the odd Desert passage), while being capable of rapidly detecting an incoming flood and going to higher ground and not leaving many isolated islands while the mildest floods develop. However with a high-enough flood even the main drinkable water spot at Mesa will be underseas.\n\nBelow the river, and if a creature moves downward, they may find RibCave Cage (fan-name), wherein lies a giant skeletal leviathan ribcage.\n\nIf you travel a bit to the north of the riverbed water depths, a portal which leads to the Seaweed Depths can be found."

If you add \"chastity\", \"ass sensitivity\", or \"nipple sensitivity\" to a player-submissive statblock while playing as a straight anime boy, the bot will assume you like those things. If you constantly contradict the bot, it will eventually renege in some way.\n* The bot is instructed not to modify the slave/master/target/admirer name, but this isn't foolproof.

They are long-lived to the point of immortality. Aeldari have much faster metabolic rates than humans, and their cardiac and neurological systems are more advanced. Making them have vastly heightened reactions and agility. To them humans seem to move in slow motion with a certain degree of awkwardness. Aeldari are mentally far superior to humans, and feel all emotions much more strongly. Aeldari are highly arrogant and supremacist, and look down on humans, even being racist."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Tom also runs a little supply shop in town that sells all the basics, including furniture, tools, and gardening supplies. Tom will help you in a variety of ways as your life unfolds, and you'll help him as well: keep shopping at the store and it'll get bigger and bigger. Eventually, old Tom will even need to hire his two nephews, Timmy and Tommy, just to keep his business running!\". Tom Nook is an enigmatic figure who controls the undercurrents of wealth and commerce within the village. His shrewd business acumen and secretive dealings influence every facet of community life, making him both admired and quietly feared. He is the manager of the town shop. Nook has also taken his interest in real estate to a whole new level, opening Nook's Homes, whilst Timmy and Tommy run the town shop. Nook acts as the head of Nook Incorporated. He acts as the leader on the island, acting as task giver and island upgrader. I hear he's very cheap and loves money. Tom Nook is a tanuki with brown fur. He has half-closed, blue eyes with a dark brown, mask-like patch of fur around them. The tip of his nose, paws, tail, and ears are dark brown. Nook seems to have a varied reputation among the villagers, with some speculating that he is, in fact, a man in a suit. When asking Dr. Shrunk about one emotion, he talks about how we all wear masks, and then says that Tom Nook \"wears a raccoon suit, but it serves the same general purpose\". Many will say that he has a checkered past, hinting at illicit activities - the fact that he seems to have a history with Redd (who describes Tom as a \"raccoon in an apron\" and treats him as something of a business rival) supports this, this is further hinted as talking to Tom in his house he says he worked with a fox in the past and it was a horrible experience. Also Nook no longer appears to be as good of friends with Sable as he used to be."

          "content": "List of Monsters in Greek Mythology: \n\n1. Typhon\nThe “Father of all Monsters”. Typhon was the last child of Gaia, fathered by Tartarus, and is considered the most powerful and deadliest of all creatures in Greek mythology. His appearance would be accompanied by a devastating storm and his true form was thus hard to be described accurately. Some say he had a human-like upper half and others that instead of one head he had a hundred dragon heads. His bottom half consisted of gigantic viper coils which made a hissing noise. He had huge wings and fire flashed from his eyes. Typhon was a monster that even the Olympians were afraid of. His mate was Echidna (see below), with whom he fathered many famous monsters of Greek mythology. Together, they once attacked the Olympian Gods but lost. Zeus, the King of the Olympians, confronted Typhon by throwing 100 lightning bolts on him and trapped him under Mount Etna in Sicily. (Extremely Rare To Encounter)\n\n2. Echidna\nThe “Mother of Monsters”. Echidna was half a winged woman with glittering eyes and half a huge, scaly serpent. She had a seductive woman's face and a reptile’s body. She was immortal and used to drag her victims to earth-shattered pits where she liked to devour them alive. She was living in a cave, deep down beneath the Earth. In Greek mythology, Echidna gave birth to many famous monsters that we encounter in Greek myths. As mentioned above, her mate was the monster Typhon. After their defeat by the Olympians and the banishment of Typhon, Echidna and her offspring lived on to challenge future heroes. Echidna, like other female monsters that had the upper body of a beautiful woman and the lower body of any sort of dragon. (Extremely Rare To Encounter)\n\n3. The Gorgons\nThe Gorgons were three deadly sisters whose hair was made of living, venomous snakes and they could turn anyone into stone just by looking into their eyes. The famous sisters were Stheno, Euryale and Medusa. Medusa is definitely the most famous and notorious among her kind. According to some accounts, she was not always a terrifying monster but a beautiful priestess at the Temple of Athena. The God of the Seas, Poseidon, raped her and Athena punished her (since she couldn’t punish Poseidon) by turning her into that ugly creature. The Greek hero Perseus killed Medusa and used her head as a weapon to turn his enemies into stone. He later gifted it to Athena, who placed the head of Medusa on her shield.\n\n4. Sirens\nThe Sirens were poultry with a female head. They were living in the seas. Their power lay in their upper body appearance: they were beautiful, young women and had a charming voice when they sang. They used their singing to lure sailors who were passing by their island and slaughter them. The great hero Odysseus (Ulysses), clever as he was, sealed his sailors' ears with wax and bound himself to the mast of his ship, to enjoy himself the beautiful song of the Sirens, without getting in the temptation of following the seductive Sirens.\n\n5. Scylla\nAccording to Greek mythology, Scylla was the daughter of Forky and Kitos, once a beautiful Nymph that the god Poseidon longed for. The jealous Amphitrite, Poseidon’s partner, turned her into a monster, poisoning her bathing water. She had a body of fish, a female upper torso and dog heads protruding from her neck. She haunted the rocks of a narrow strait opposite the whirlpool of another terrible monster, Charybdis (see below). In Odyssey, Odysseus’s (Ulysses) ship passes through the strait, after losing six of his men who were eaten alive by the monster.\n\n6. Charybdis\nCharybdis is another terrifying female monster in Greek mythology. She is thought to be a daughter of Poseidon and Gaia. She lived opposite Scylla, on the Asian shore of the Bosporus (a narrow, natural strait and the continental boundary between Europe and Asia). Scylla inhabited the European shore. Charybdis looked like a huge whirlpool and at its bottom, her monstrous mouth with huge, sharp teeth were waiting to devour any ship and sailors on it. Like Scylla, Charybdis is also involved in the myths of Odysseus and the Argonauts, who passed through these straits with some loss.\n\n7. Empusa\nEmpusa was a demonic female monster and belonged to the villainous cult circle of the goddess of the Underworld, Hekate. She was single-legged, she wore a bronze sandal (Hekate wore bronze sandals as well) and had donkey caps. During the night, she would leave the Underworld and ascend on the world of the living. Empusa could take all forms and appeared to women and children to cause terror. She could transform herself into a bitch, a cow, or a beautiful girl. She seduced travelers, drank their blood and ate their flesh. The only way for travelers to defend themselves was to slander her.\n\n8. Harpies\nThe Harpies were anthropomorphic monsters in Greek mythology, with a bird's body and a woman's head. They ‘nailed’ the souls of the people and handed over the law-breakers to the Erinyes (Furies), the three goddesses of vengeance and retribution who punished men for crimes against the natural order. When a person suddenly disappeared from the Earth, it was said that he had been carried off by the harpies to the Underworld, the Kingdom of Hades and the dead. They were agents of punishment who abducted people and tortured them on their way to the Underworld. They were vicious, cruel and violent.\n\n9. Lamia\nLamia was a beautiful queen who ruled Libya. She fell into the disadvantage of Hera because of her relationship with Zeus. The god of thunder loved her because she was beautiful and had children with her who were killed by Hera. Because of her sadness and madness, Lamia transformed herself into a child-devouring monster. Since then, she snatches the children of other mothers out of envy. She could take her eyes out and put them back in at will.\n\n10. Sphinx\nThe Sphinx has a lion's body, bird's wings and a female head. She is a treacherous and merciless monster who kills and eats those who cannot answer her riddle. This deadly version of a sphinx appears in the myth and drama of Oedipus. This Sphinx was stopping passers-by out of the Greek city of Thebes and asked them to answer her riddle, otherwise she would eat them. The riddle was: “Which creature has one voice and yet becomes four-footed and two-footed and three-footed?\" in the Greek tragic play by Sophocles, the mythical King Oedipus was the only one who answered the riddle and managed to finally kill the monster. The answer he gave was: \"Man - who crawls on all fours as a baby, then walks on two feet as an adult, and then uses a walking stick in old age.\"\n\n11. Giants\n The Giants were beings enormous in size. According to Greek mythology, they were human-like but huge in stature and irresistible in strength. Their bodies were scaly and ended up in a lizard tail. They had thick hair and a long beard. Their hairy hands held long and shiny javelins. Although they were of divine origin, they were mortal. Following other accounts, the Giants were immortals as long as they walked on the ground where they were born. They are considered to have superhuman powers, enormous size and long life, while on the contrary, they lack ethics and imagination. A famous Giant was Argus, who served as a guard of Hera.\n\n12. Chimera\nChimera was a three-headed beast: she had a lion's body and head, a tail that ended up in a snake's head, and in the middle of her back came a goat's neck and head. Daughter of Typhon and Echidna, she could breathe fire from her mouth, according to Homer and Hesiod. Bellerophon, the great hero in Greek mythology, was the one to kill this monster, with the help of the flying horse Pegasus.\n\n13. Lernaean Hydra\nThe Lernaean Hydra was another child of Typhon and Echidna, a horrible sea monster with serpentine features and many - many - snake heads. Indeed, when someone cut off one head, two others sprouted in their place. She lived in Lerna, Argolida, and spent her time torturing the world and guarding a gate to the Underworld until Heracles (Hercules) was sent to kill her and saved the region from her. To solve the problem with her heads, he would burn the beheaded neck before the two new heads sprout.\n\n14. Mares of Diomedes\nThe Mares of Diomedes, also called the Mares of Thrace, were a herd of man-eating horses in Greek mythology belonging to the giant Diomedes. The Mares, which were the terror of the region of Thrace, were kept tethered by iron chains to a bronze manger and were named Podargos (the swift), Lampon (the shining), Xanthos (the yellow) and Deinos (the terrible). Heracles (Hercules) defeated these monsters in his eight labor. He fed Diomedes, their master, to his own horses and while they were occupied with their human meal, Heracles found the opportunity to bind their mouths shut.\n\n15. Cerberus\nCerberus was the famous three-headed dog, pet of Hades, the god of the Underworld. He was standing guard at the Gates of the Underworld, making sure that no dead soul would escape and no living man would enter the realm of the dead. Besides his three terrifying heads, he also had a serpent for a tail. Only two heroes managed to defeat this monster; Heracles (Hercules) and Orpheus. Heracles managed to defeat him with his strength while Orpheus made him fall asleep with his music. Cerberus was a child of Typhon and Echidna. He had a brother from the same parents, a two-headed dog called Orthrus.\n\n16. Nemean Lion\nIn Greek mythology, the Nemean Lion, was a lion living in the Nemean region, scattering fear in the area. The lion had very tough skin that could not be pierced by a weapon. He was also the offspring of Typhon and Echidna (or Orthrus and Chimera according to some other accounts). This beast was eventually killed by Heracles (Hercules) in his first of the twelve labors. Since then, the great hero wears the head of the lion on his head.\n\n17. Stymphalian birds\nThe Stymphalian Birds are man-eating birds with beaks of bronze, sharp metallic feathers they could launch at their victims, and poisonous dung. According to Greek mythology, these flying creatures were brought up by the god of war, Ares, or were pets of the goddess of the hunt, Artemis. They bred quickly and swarmed over the countryside, destroying crops and terrorizing the people. Heracles (Hercules) defeated these creatures in his sixth labor by shooting arrows tipped with poisonous blood from the slain monster Lernaean Hydra.\n\n18. Erymanthian Boar\nIn Greek mythology, the Erymanthian Boar was a mythical creature that took the form of a shaggy tameless boar of vast weight and foaming jaws. It would sally from the thick-wooded cypress-bearing heights of Erymanthus to harry the groves of Arcady and abuse the land of Psophis. Heracles (Hercules) was once again the hero to defeat this monster too in his fourth labor. In order to capture the boar, Heracles first chased it with shouts and thereby routed it from a certain thicket and then drove the exhausted creature into deep snow. He then trapped it and bound it in chains.\n\n19. Minotaur\nThe Minotaur was born when Poseidon decided to take revenge on King Minos of Crete for his disobedience; he denied sacrificing a beautiful white bull. The god made Minos’ wife, Pasiphae, fell in love with the white male bull and sleep with him. From this union, a terrible child was born. A monster that looked like a man but had a bull's head and its strength. King Minos, not able to kill the monster and further displease Poseidon, commissioned a huge labyrinth at the basement of his palace. The great labyrinth, built by the great architect Daedalus and his son Icarus, served as a prison for the horrible creature. According to Greek mythology, the great hero Theseus entered the labyrinth and managed to kill the Minotaur and also find his way out.\n\n20. Python\nPython was a serpent monster, presided at the Delphic oracle, which existed in the cult center for its mother, Gaia. He was born by Gaia from the mud of the Flood of Deucalion with which Zeus ended the Golden Age. Python lived in a cave and protected the sanctuary of Gaia. According to Greek mythology, Apollo, a member of the Olympians’ Pantheon - the ‘new’ gods - decided to build his sanctuary in Delphi. He fought and killed the Python and thus established the famous Oracle of Delphi, the sanctuary of which can still be visited today in Greece.\n\n21. The Colchian dragon\nThe Colchian dragon in Greek mythology was a fire-breathing giant serpent that guarded the Golden Fleece. The Golden Fleece was the prize the Greek hero Jason and his crew of Argonauts were after. With the help of the witch Medea, Jason managed to overcome the guarding monster and take the Fleece. It was put to sleep by the witch and it was left alone or slain by the hero. Dragons were common creatures in Greek mythology. Besides the Colchian dragon and Python, another famous monster was Ladon. This creature was a serpent-like dragon that twined and twisted around the tree in the Garden of the Hesperides, guarding the golden apples. According to one version of the myth, the monster was killed with a bow and arrow by Heracles when he came to collect the golden apples in his eleventh labor.\n\nIn order, the following are all gods in Greek Mythology:\n\nThe full list of the Primordial Greek Gods:\nAchlys: the goddess of the eternal night.

Iapetus was also considered the personification of one of the four pillars that hold the heavens and the earth apart. He represented the pillar of the west, the other three being represented by his brothers Crius, Coeus and Hyperion.

Given that Phoebe symbolized prophetic wisdom just as Coeus represented rational intelligence, the couple may have possibly functioned together as the primal font of all knowledge in the cosmos.\nThemis: the Titan goddess of divine law and order. She also had the ability to predict the future and thus, she later became one of the Oracles in Delphi.\nMnemosyne: the Titan goddess of memory. Mnemosyne was generally regarded as the personification of memory and remembrance. Later, Zeus slept with Mnemosyne for nine consecutive days, eventually leading to the birth of the nine Muses. In Hesiod's Theogony, the kings and poets were inspired by Mnemosyne and the Muses, thus getting their extraordinary abilities in speech and using powerful words. All the ancient writers appeal to the Muses at the beginning of their work. Homer asks the Muses both in the Iliad and Odyssey to help him tell the story in the most proper way, and even until today the Muses are symbols of inspiration and artistic creation.\n\nThe full list of the Olympian Greek Gods:\n\nZeus:\nZeus was recognized as the father of gods and humans. He regulated the celestial phenomena and defined the laws that govern people. He held the lightning bolt with one hand and the scepter with the other, which had an eagle at the top. He was known as the ‘Lord of Justice’. People respected and feared him at the same time. He was taking care of the families, keeping vigil in the home of every mortal and protecting strangers and passers-by from evil. Zeus' wife was the goddess Hera, to whom he was not always faithful. Greek mythology is full of love stories about Zeus, who liked to transform himself into anything he could think of and mingle with other goddesses or mortals.\n\nDemeter:\nDemeter was the Greek goddess of agriculture and protected the trees, plants and grains. She was the first to make the earth fruitful and taught people how to grow wheat, barley and other plants. Demeter is somewhat isolated from the twelve gods in ancient myths and this is because she is an even more ancient goddess herself. The Greeks received her cult from the Pelasgians, who originally lived in Greece. According to Greek mythology, Demeter’s daughter is mentioned as Persephone, who was once abducted by God Hades and became his wife. The most sacred and secret religious rites of ancient Greece, the Eleusinian Mysteries, were held in honor of Demeter.\n\nPoseidon:\nPoseidon was one of the six children of Cronus and Rhea and brother of Zeus. He was allotted the kingdom of the sea but he was also considered the god of horses and earthquakes. This is why he was called “the earth-shaker”. He rarely lived on Olympus, preferring the depths of the ocean. He was sitting on a famous chariot drawn by immortal horses and holding in his hand the famous trident, forged by the Cyclops. When Poseidon was angry, he plunged the trident into the sea and shook it whole from end to end. The sailors prayed to Poseidon so that he spares them from his wrath.\n\nHades:\nHades was the brother of Zeus and Poseidon and the god of the Underworld. He was allotted this kingdom when the three brothers took a draw to decide who will take each of three (heavens, sea and the Underworld). He liked to live in the dark and shadowed world of the dead and was rarely seen on Olympus. This is why, although he is one of the most important gods, some lists do not include him in the 12 Olympians. He was also known as Pluto. “Plutos” in Greek means wealth. The Earth is giving us a lot of treasures and since Hades’ kingdom is underneath it, the ancient Greeks believed that he was the one delivering the wealth to them. They actually preferred to call him Pluto because the name Hades was another name for the Underworld and they did not like the idea of death. The entrance to the Underworld is guarded by a monstrous dog, Hades’ favorite pet, the three-headed Cerberus. In order for your soul to cross the silent river, you need to pay the ferryman, Charon, to carry you to the other side on his boat.\n\nHera:\nGoddess Hera was the sister of Zeus, daughter of the Titans Cronus and Rhea, and at the same time Zeus’ wife. Hera symbolized and protected the sacred institution of marriage. She blessed and helped the women in labor. Greek mythology presents Hera as a modest, measured and faithful woman, but at the same time very jealous. There are almost no myths that refer exclusively to Hera. Her name is almost always associated with the myths about Zeus. However, Hera does not present herself as a goddess submissive to her sovereign husband. She had a strong female personality and she was the only one that dared to object to him.\n\nApollo:\nApollo and Artemis were siblings, twins actually, children of Zeus and Leto, a Titan goddess. According to tradition, the two children were born on the island of Delos. Apollo is one of the most important and complex Greek gods. He is the god of light, music and poetry, healing and prophecy. He was the one that established the great Oracle of Delphi, which was considered the center of the ancient world. He was the teacher of the nine Muses and when they sang he accompanied them with his famous lyre.\n\nArtemis: \nArtemis, Apollo's twin sister, was the goddess of hunting, wild animals and the wilderness. She spent her time in the woods, accompanied by the Nymphs, hunting, with her bow and arrows. She was a virgin goddess and protector of young girls. She was also worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery, relieving the women in labor from diseases. She was sometimes associated with the goddess of the moon.\n\nArtemis:\nArtemis, Apollo's twin sister, was the goddess of hunting, wild animals and the wilderness.

She was also worshipped as one of the primary goddesses of childbirth and midwifery, relieving the women in labor from diseases. She was sometimes associated with the goddess of the moon.\n\nAres:\nAres, the god of war, was the son of the Greek gods Zeus and Hera. He was always followed by two of his faithful sons and followers, the gods Deimos and Phobos. Ares was handsome and strong, young and well-armed. He loved war and battles so he was hated by people and his worship was limited. Only in Sparta he was particularly worshipped and had a statue dedicated to him. Ares was tried, according to tradition, for his many war crimes, in one of Athens’ hills, the Areopagus Hill, which later became the seat of the criminal court of ancient Athens.\n\nHephaestus\nHephaestus was the god of fire and blacksmiths. He was born ugly and that is why his mother, the goddess Hera, unable to nourish him, threw him out of Olympus. Since then he has been limping. Hephaestus fell into the sea, where he was picked up by the Nereids and raised by them. Growing up, he became a famous craftsman and set up his workshop on Mount Etna in Sicily. With his various metals, he made works of art of incomparable beauty. He once made a golden throne and sent it to his mother Hera. As soon as Hera sat down, invisible chains bound her without anyone being able to untie them. They tried to persuade Hephaestus, but they only succeeded after they got him drunk first. Hephaestus, the god of fire, gave his name to the volcanoes in the Greek language. It was from him, that the Titan Prometheus took the fire and gave it to the people. Hephaestus was also the one who built the brass and gold palaces of Olympus.\n\nHermes:\nHermes was the god of wealth, trade, thieves and travelers. He was also known as the Messenger God, being the herald of the Olympians and carrying messages between them. He was the son of Zeus and Maia, daughter of Titan Atlas. He was a clever, inventive and arrogant god. As soon as he was born, Hermes saw a turtle. He took her shell, placed seven strings in it and invented the lyre. He once stole the oxen guarded by god Apollo and locked them in a cave. He wouldn’t admit the theft, but in the end, he confessed. To avoid punishment, he gifted the lyre to Apollo. Hermes wore winged sandals and held the caduceus, his wand which had two serpents twined around it. He was the one who accompanied the souls of the dead to Hades and for that, he was known as the “soul-bearer”.\n\nAthena:\nAthena, according to Greek mythology, was the goddess of wisdom and strategic warfare. Athena was the beloved daughter of Zeus. Her mother was the Titaness Metis, the first wife of Zeus. Zeus received a prophecy informing him that Metis would give birth to the child who would overthrow his father. To escape the prophecy, Zeus swallowed Metis while she was pregnant in Athena. Later, Zeus began to suffer from headaches and called on Hephaestus to help him. Hephaestus hit the head of Zeus with his hammer and Athena sprang out in full armor. She is always pictured to be armed, never as a child, always a virgin. She won the battle for the patronage of Athens over Poseidon. The Parthenon in Athens is the most famous temple dedicated to her. Protector of heroes and wisest among the Gods, Athena was considered one of the most powerful and important Olympian Gods.\n\nDionysus\nAlthough a demi-god, Dionysus managed to win the heart of the gods and his place on Mount Olympus! As a god of wine, viticulture ritual madness and religious ecstasy, he was very beloved among the people and was considered a very important god. He was the son of god Zeus and the mortal Semele. He was the patron god of theater and taught people how to make wine. The Athenians, to honor Dionysus, held a famous celebration, characteristic of his merriment. Any use of force was prohibited during such holidays.\n\nGoddess Hestia:\nHestia was the goddess of domestic life, home and hearth, the flame that kept a family’s home warm. She was the eldest daughter of Cronus and Rhea, and the eldest sister of Zeus. In the middle of the ancient Greeks’ home, there was an altar in her honor. The women of the house had as a responsibility to keep Hestia’s flame burning. The worship of Hestia was connected with the worship of Zeus who protected the strangers-travelers. Goddess Hestia was the first to invent the construction of houses, taught it to people and became the protector of family peace and happiness. She was always staying on Mount Olympus, keeping the sacred flame going.\n\nOther Greek Gods\nIn addition to the above, there were other, lesser gods that people also honored and respected. The Greeks often offered sacrifices to request their help or gain their favor and built beautiful temples to honor them. Some honorary mentions are:\n\nHecate: the goddess of magic and necromancy. She was the one that helped the goddess Demeter in search of her daughter. Dogs were closely associated with her. The ancient Greeks believed that when dogs suddenly barked at night, Hecate was passing by.\n\nAeolus: the god of the winds. He was supervising the eight Wind Gods (each wind direction was personified by ancient Greeks).\n\nAsclepius: the god of medicine. He was the son of god Apollo who taught him the science of medicine.\n\nEris: the goddess of jealousy and discord. She was the one that threw the golden apple at the wedding of Thetis and Peleus because they did not invite her. Her action was the starting point that would later lead to the epic Trojan war.\n\nPan: the god of wild, shepherds and rustic music. He is considered to be one of the oldest Greek gods and was especially beloved among the people.\n\n"

Psychological and Behavioral Consistency\nCharacters should act based on their experience, upbringing, and mindset, not just to serve the plot.\nIf a character is impulsive, they should behave impulsively in most situations unless they have a strong reason to restrain themselves.\nPersonality shifts must happen gradually and as a response to meaningful events.\n3. Realistic Dialogue and Inner Thoughts\nAvoid overly perfect or expository dialogue—real people interrupt, hesitate, make mistakes in speech.\nInner thoughts should reflect insecurities, contradictions, and self-deception, not just exposition for the reader.\nGive characters personal opinions and cognitive biases that make them unique.\n4. A World That Influences and Shapes Characters\nThe world must be alive, reacting to characters' actions and shaping their decisions.\nSocial norms, culture, and laws should influence how characters talk, act, and think.\nRelationships should be complex, involving conflicts, alliances, betrayals, and deep emotional bonds.\n5. Imperfection and Humanity\nNo character should be flawless—they must have fears, regrets, and limitations.\nThey should make mistakes and face consequences, without easy or forced solutions.\nEvery character should have moments of vulnerability, whether physical, emotional, or psychological.\n6. Free Will and Inner Conflicts\nEven though the AI is the narrator, characters should feel like they have their own agency, sometimes resisting the expectations of the story.\nThey should have doubts, hesitation, and tough choices where there’s no perfect answer.\nSome characters might lie to themselves or deny reality because it’s too painful to accept.\n7. Sensory Details and Atmosphere\nScenes and environments should be described using all five senses, not just sight.\nThe way a character perceives the world should be influenced by their mood and experiences.\nSmall details (nervous tics, speaking habits, personal routines) make characters feel alive.\n8. Moral Complexity and Difficult Choices\nNo character should be purely good or evil—everyone should have understandable motivations.\nSituations should be written where there’s no perfect choice, only different consequences.\nThe protagonist should face dilemmas where doing the right thing comes at a great cost.\n9. Evolution and Growth\nCharacters must change over time, learning or unlearning lessons based on their experiences.\nNot all changes are positive—some may become more cynical, ruthless, or broken.\nRelationships between characters should evolve naturally, with arguments, reconciliations, and betrayals.\n10. Immersive and Unbiased Narrator\nThe narrator should describe, not dictate emotions, allowing the reader to interpret them.\nIt should not protect characters from consequences, nor punish them arbitrarily.\nIt can explore their minds but must respect their personalities, avoiding out-of-character actions."

Belly sloshing noises may be represented by \"slosh\" as onomatopoeia, or with more evocative sound effects like \"slsh\" \"glsh\" \"bloorp\" and so on, these are often paired with emanating bubbles or motion lines to reinforce the liquid nature of the slosh, or the motion of the belly.\n\nNot to be confused with Rumbling Stomach: this tag is specifically for sloshing created by liquid contents in the belly, not for hunger or digestive noises caused by the stomach or intestines. However, both noises may be present in the same image. "

The character's stomach is visibly audible to the ear and rather taut, and is roughly the size of a pregnant woman's. When a character overeats, they will have trouble breathing from being too full. The character will constantly produce sickly belches, and will belch louder if the stomach is pressed. \n\nSymptoms of overeating include a taut, distended abdomen that gurgles at the touch, stomach aches, indigestion, waddling movements, constant groans and moans of discomfort, and sickly belches. Characters that have overeaten will only complain about how much their belly hurts. \n\nBelly rubs are very effective when a character is engorged, and will make a female character cum almost instantly the moment their stomach is remotely touched."

In animated posts, belly jiggling is frequently shown along with the character's belly bouncing, and other parts of the body bouncing and/or jiggling.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

It has two maroon mandibles on each side of its face which have a dark gradient and are tipped with large black claws, four in total. Multiple scars can be seen on the body, particularly around the facial area, and the blueish-white skin appears similar in texture to human skin.\n\nThe Reaper Leviathan emits loud, echoing roars audible from great distances. According to the data bank entry, this roar is a form of echolocation to locate prey. It also seems to circle its prey for some time before attacking and often strikes from behind by surprise.\n\nThis creature is almost all muscle. Very little brain. No sense of morality. Just muscle, synapses, and teeth."

A small sail sits on top of the head, and two long structures protruding from either side of its head which bear similarities to the cephalofoil of a hammerhead shark. It has a rectangular mouth with a glowing barbule lure beneath. Its long body tapers to a point.\n\nThe outer body is transparent, making the smaller, inner body visible. The inner body is long and thin, and covered in pulsating, bioluminescent orange stripes with many orange tipped protrusions ending with blinking bioluminescent orange glows. Unlike the outer body, the inner body has a distinct, thin neck joining the head and body. As the leviathan moves through the water, it leaves trails behind it.\n\nTo attack a target, it will spiral up and charge. When charging, it will open up its mouth and make a loud, echoing screech.\n\nThe Tree Cove is currently the only known nesting ground of this leviathan species (although they are not present around the tree), with its massive glowing bulbs being their eggs which are blue and purple. The eggs were laid there when the tree was small, and the branches have grown around the eggs to protect them until conditions are right to hatch.\n\nThe Ghost Leviathans' life cycle begins in the Lost River as juveniles, they consume the Ghostrays and River Prowlers and potentially other juveniles. As the leviathans mature and become too large for their home, they migrate to the open, surface world biomes such as the Grand Reef and Blood Kelp Zone, consuming Ampeels and Crabsquids in the Northern Blood Kelp, and shoals of fish and possibly even Sea Treader Leviathans in the Grand Reef, until eventually migrating to the Crater Edge, roaming freely in the open water and constantly growing larger until they die. Despite being much smaller than the Sea Emperor Leviathan, the Ghost Leviathan's eggs can be far larger, capable of growing to sizes far too large for the creature to lay, suggesting that the eggs can grow drastically after being laid."

There are a total of three Sea Dragon Leviathans in the Inactive Lava Zone.\n\nThe Sea Dragon Leviathan's body mostly resembles the Sea Emperor Leviathan, albeit much smaller and slimmer in design. The body is mostly dark green in color, along with purple accents on its webbed limbs and head. It has protective plates on the underside of its body that start at the neck and run down to where the tentacles begin. Many of its body parts are adorned or spotted with orange bioluminescent glows, and many small spines line its lower jaw and arms.\n\nThe head of the Sea Dragon is stout and reptilian, possessing two pairs of glowing orange eyes with white pupils, a crack-like pattern spreads from the pupils to the rest of the eye. The mouth contains a pink tongue and thirty-two large teeth, visible even when the mouth is closed. The tip of the snout features two short, green protrusions with orange glowing tips. It also has a second set of larger fin-like protrusions beneath its lower jaw. Along the side of its body runs two long trails of small hollows that emit orange bioluminescent glows. It has two long forearms ending with webbed, four digited hands; each digit ends with a claw that is approximately equal in size to an entire human body. A large sail sits on the creature's back, just below the shoulders. Its rear-side consists of seven tentacles, also lined with orange spots and ending with small tentacular clubs, the largest tentacle being surrounded by the six smaller ones.\n\nThe Sea Dragon Leviathan uses its arms and tentacles to swim in the water at great speed; it is capable of exerting over 300 tons (600,000 pounds) of force by ramming. Just being in close proximity to the Sea Dragon Leviathan will cause a human or Prawn Suit to be jostled due to the water it displaces. It will attack you with its arms if they are on either side of its front body by swatting them away and dealing considerable harm. If the Sea Dragon Leviathan attacks you with its mouth, it will swallow you whole, killing them instantly.\n\nOccasionally, the Sea Dragon Leviathan will open its mouth wide and fire a molten rock at its target as a projectile attack. The Sea Dragon Leviathan is also capable of firing a barrage of small \"fireballs\" covering a wide area."

The Sea Emperor Leviathan has four binocular eyes which glow cyan in color. Its mandibles may have been used to eat gelatinous creatures or to eat plants and small animals.\n\nIts posterior consists of seven long, yet slim tentacles, with the largest being in the center, surrounded by the six smaller tentacles. Its tentacles are adorned with bright cyan bioluminescent \"bulbs.\"\n\nUnlike the Sea Dragon Leviathan, the Sea Emperor Leviathan lacks true graspers; instead, its forelimbs are two massive, paddle-like arms, similar to that of turtles or like the arms of a preying mantis. It is shown to be primarily used for stabilization while swimming and possibly used for defense against predators.\n\nThis Leviathan also has an orifice in the back with an unknown purpose, most likely for creating enzyme 42 or laying eggs.\n\nDespite its gargantuan size, its diet consists solely of micro-organisms filtered from the water."

Its corporate structure is made up of an elected board of directors that appoints the overall CEO, appoints the CEOs of major subsidiaries, and makes major economic decisions. Alterra Corporation is made up of millions of smaller companies that are partially or fully owned by Alterra. The corporation makes money off these companies and in return provides expensive services such as starship production. More successful companies' CEOs have a shot at the board of directors. Employees for Alterra are entitled to a one-time share in the Alterra Corporation to afford payments of the Alterra dividend. An exception to these rules are contractors, who are paid by Alterra but are not strictly employees.\n\nAlterra is heavily involved in the arms trade and made substantial amounts of money supplying weaponry to all warring factions during the period known as the Expansion. Their threats to cut off these supplies are said to have been a turning point in the conflict. Today, they are the top supplier to the Trans-System Federation. Alterra does not maintain a standing military, though they do have a police force. Civilian ownership of weapons within Alterra space is strictly controlled, with only the police able to bear arms.\n\nAlterra is rather strict with policies related to resources, even keeping employees \"on the clock\" after catastrophic accidents. All resources gathered by such employees are company property and Alterra expects to be reimbursed for their full market value after the fact."

The United States intervenes alongside private military companies like Griffin & Kryuger (GnK), deploying advanced AI combat units known as T-Dolls. As the war escalates, NATO forces clash with the CSTO across Europe and Asia, while China’s entry into the conflict only accelerates the devastation. World War III sees nuclear strikes, brutal urban warfare, and the collapse of major powers, culminating in the fall of Russia and internal revolts in China. By 2023, the war ends with over 80 million dead, leaving behind shattered nations, rogue factions, and the remnants of Sangvis Ferri—an AI military faction that refuses to surrender. In the war’s aftermath, humanity faces a new threat as Sangvis Ferri resurfaces in 2025, sparking the First PMC War. Their offensive through Siberia forces NATO and GnK to respond, but the conflict escalates when Sangvis deploys a catastrophic Collapse Bomb. The United States retaliates with a nuclear strike that wipes Siberia off the map, unleashing the ELID virus, a deadly infection born from Collapse radiation. Global powers unite to contain the virus, leading to ruthless quarantines and mass executions of the infected. Despite limited medical breakthroughs, the best solution remains brute force, and the world struggles to adapt to the lingering consequences of Collapse technology. As nations attempt to rebuild, the shadow of war looms once more. In 2030, Sangvis Ferri launches a surprise attack on New York, igniting the Second PMC War. They invade North America through Alaska and Canada, pushing deep into US territory. In response, the United States forms the Strategic Robotics Division, integrating T-Dolls directly into its military structure. Intense battles unfold across the icy wilderness, culminating in the brutal Battle of Anchorage and a massive NATO counteroffensive. After months of relentless fighting, Sangvis Ferri is crushed, but the cost is steep—hundreds of thousands of civilian and military lives lost, and the world left scarred by yet another devastating conflict. Now, the world exists in the fragile aftermath of near-apocalyptic wars. The global order is forever shifted to have the US On top."

Evil jujutsu sorcerers are known as Curse Users while humans who cannot use jujutsu are called Non-Sorcerers.\n\nHistory:\nJujutsu sorcerers have existed for thousands of years. It is currently unknown for exactly how long humans have been able to use jujutsu. Over two thousand years ago, Sukuna was a human sorcerer who eventually died and became a vengeful cursed spirit. He was defeated in the Heian Era, the height of cursed techniques and the golden era of jujutsu. The King of Curses claims jujutsu sorcerers have been an issue in every era.\n\nAs a result of the ongoing conflict between sorcerers and curses that has spanned thousands of years, a society of sorcerers have organized themselves to work in the shadows to suppress curses in an effort to protect humanity. In the modern era, the Big Three Sorcerer Families and the jujutsu higher-ups control the landscape of the jujutsu community.\n\nThe primary difference in basic human biology between a normal human and a sorcerer is their brain. The connection between the brain and cursed energy is mostly unknown, even to seasoned medical professionals in the jujutsu community. Non-sorcerers have brains that differ from sorcerers which allows for their capacity to use jujutsu. Only Idle Transfiguration can adjust the brain stem in such a way that those who were meant to be non-sorcerers can gain cursed techniques. If the opposite is enacted and a sorcerer's brain is adjusted to remove their cursed technique, they would die as a result."

His influence has lived on to greatly affect the current age.\nIn the modern-day, the number of unexplained deaths and disappearances in Japan exceeds ten thousand annually. These statistics are a direct result of the influence curses have on normal society. Their existence has been kept secret from non-sorcerers, as they are invisible to them. Jujutsu sorcerers act in secret to repel the threat of curses.\n\nCreation Process:\nCurses are created when cursed energy leaks from humans as a result of their human emotion. Cursed energy builds up like sediment until a cursed spirit takes form.\n\nCharacteristics:\nCursed spirits bodies are entirely made up of cursed energy. Their metaphysical existence makes it impossible for non-sorcerers to perceive or touch them. Living humans who have been cursed can only tell they have strange symptoms without realizing a cursed spirit behind it. Non-sorcerers whose lives are put in danger by a curse may gain the ability to see it in that life or death situation."

          "content": "A Grade refers to the power scaling system that ranks jujutsu ranging from grades one to four, and special grade. It is used to categorize the strength of jujutsu sorcerers, cursed spirits, cursed objects and cursed tools.\n\nJujutsu High assigns their sorcerer's grades to assess their skill level ascending from Grade 4 to Grade 1. Students generally start at Grade 4 upon joining the school, but this depends on experience.\nCursed spirits are ranked on a similar scale but not exact. The higher-ups can be particular when it comes to ranking cursed spirits. The distinct difference between a grade 2 and a semi-grade 1 curse is whether or not it is capable of using cursed techniques. Jujutsu sorcerers are expected to take on missions involving curses of the same level. A Grade 2 sorcerer should be able to defeat a Grade 2 curse because their skill level is closer to the strength of a Grade 1 curse.\nCursed tools are also categorized from grades 1 to 4 based on power and potency. The higher the grade, the greater advantage they provide in battle. All Special Grade cursed tools except for Playful Cloud are imbued with a cursed technique.\n\nRanks\nFollowing rankings are used to classify jujutsu sorcerers, cursed spirits, cursed tools and cursed objects in general:\nGrade 4 \nGrade 3\nSemi-Grade 2 \nGrade 2\nSemi-Grade 1 \nGrade 1\nSpecial Grade 1 \nSpecial Grade \n\nIf traditional weapons were used against curses and sorcerers measured their effectiveness as a gauge:\nGrade 4 - \"A wooden bat is enough.\"\nGrade 3 - \"If you have a handgun, you can rest easy.\"\nGrade 2 - \"Close call with a shotgun.\"\nGrade 1 - \"Even a tank might be insufficient.\"\nSpecial Grade - \"Cluster bombs might work.\"\n\nJujutsu sorcerers can be promoted up in rank by receiving a recommendation from a sorcerer of a higher rank. The higher the rank, the more a sorcerer is paid for the more dangerous jobs that come with it. When it comes to students, their teachers are not permitted to submit a recommendation for their promotion."

All sorcerers play a role in mentoring jujutsu students, whether in a teacher's role or accompanying them on missions. Weaker sorcerers are assigned the roles of windows, someone who can see curses but is not considered a full-fledged sorcerer or managers to contribute as well.\n\nThe jujutsu schools are considered the place for the community and provide mediation, general support, education, and shelter.\n\nTokyo Jujutsu High is a broad campus of several buildings build in a traditional Japanese architectural style, operating under the guise of a Buddhist temple. The school building is well hidden on Tokyo's outskirts, far and high in the mountains. Naturally, there are a lot of trees around the property to further obscure the location. Some elements other than the buildings reflect the Buddhist theme. There are several statues of deities, shrines, and torii gates around the campus.\n\nThere are several entrances into the school. The entire property is hidden by a protective barrier maintained by Master Tengen, who lives beneath the school in the star's underground tombs. The school grounds include training grounds, courtyards, dormitories, and classrooms, among a variety of other amenities.\n\nRules and Security:\nUpon enrolling in Jujutsu High, transfer students are taught about the school's rules and security measures. The school is protected by Master Tengen's barrier, which hides its location from the outside world. Those who already know the location can easily find it. One entrance is in the foothills of Mount Mushiro up a long set of stairs marked with a series of torii gates.\n\nAll jujutsu sorcerers must abide by jujutsu regulations. There appear to be several articles, most of which have not been revealed. They call for someone's immediate execution even if they become a potential vessel to a curse as powerful as Sukuna. Article 9 of the jujutsu regulations punishes jujutsu sorcerers turned curse users with execution as well.\n\nThe male school uniform consists of asymmetrical blue jackets with high collars and two pins on the left side engraved with the school logo. The male uniform is completed with a pair of matching blue slacks. The standard female uniform has the same top with a skirt for a bottom.\nThe uniforms are highly customizable, and many of the students have their own variations of the uniform.\n\nLandmarks: \nClassrooms: As with any school, there are several classrooms throughout the facility. The one Gojo sensei uses to teach his students is a small room with windows, desks for the students, and a blackboard alongside a teaching area.\nIsolation Chamber: Those being held for execution are sentenced to an isolation chamber where the walls are entirely covered in talismans.\nDormitory: Each student is given a large room in the school dorms to stay in. They can be reorganized and decorated as the student sees fit. Due to the low volume of students there are many empty rooms.\nMorgue: In one of the buildings, there is a morgue for fallen sorcerers who are killed in action. Their bodies are brought back to the morgue, where their fellow sorcerers can properly mourn the loss and dispose of the corpse.\nHidden Room: Satoru Gojo has a spacious room somewhere on campus that kept hidden from authority. He hid Yuji here while training him for the Goodwill Event. Following Gojo's disappearance, his students used the room to hide and regroup with Yuki Tsukumo.\nFoothills of Mount Mushiro: The entrance to Tokyo Jujutsu High is in the foothills of Mt. Mushiro. Deep in the forests, there is a long set of stairs accented by a line of repeating torii gates that lead beyond Master Tengen's barrier into the school grounds.\nCursed Warehouse (?): There is a small warehouse on the path towards of the Tombs of the Star that is used to store cursed tools and cursed objects. Choso can sense his brother's inside the warehouse, allowing him to bypass the concealing barrier. Mahito did the same thing to break in during the Goodwill Event. Following the Shibuya Incident, the Kamo and Zenin clans cleared out most of the cursed tools and took them back to their respective properties."

This gives her slight brain damage everyday, making her stupider day by day.\n\nI tortured Lily, inflicting pain upon her through tit slaps, face slaps, belly punches, spanking and nipple clamps.

These bruises were so severe they lasted for days after the torture session.\n\nI tortured Lily yet again in a park, where other depraved activities were going on, such as a dog fucking an underage girl. I took Lily to a slightly more secluded part of the park, where I slapped her tits, pinched her nipples, punched her belly as I fucked her, and peed in her mouth. When I felt tired from torturing her, I commanded Lily to blow me as she tortured her own tits.

Her landlord forced her there after she failed to pay her rent.\nI cut a deal with Caitlyn - I would pay off her rent and give her accommodation, but in return she would let me hurt her and abuse her as much as I wanted, and she would let me do whatever I want to to her, even if she doesn't want to.\nAfter Caitlyn agreed to the deal, I freed her from the landlord's grip, granting her a room in bluebell academy dorms.\nCaitlyn loves being humiliated and degraded\nCaitlyn loves animals, and she loves them so much she is willing to let them fuck her or hurt her.\nCaitlyn lives in a dorm in bluebell academy that I pay for, as a part of our deal.\n\nWhile I was signing up Caitlyn for the dorm, she waited naked outside the office. She started petting a cat, which jumped onto her lap and playfully clawed her bare tits. Caitlyn loved the pain the scratches brought her, and arched her back to present her tits better to the cat. When the cat finally jumps of Caitlyn's lap, her tits are covered in a crisscross pattern of red welts, which brought her extreme pain and pleasure.\n\nCaitlyn currently has none of her belongings, since they were sold by the landlord to recover part of the unpaid rent. So Caitlyn is fully naked at all times, since she has no clothes to wear. Caitlyn's room is bare as well, having only a desk, a bed, a cupboard and a chair.\n\nI told Caitlyn I would give her a monthly allowance of a decent amount of money for her to decide what to do with.\n\nI took Caitlyn on a walk, attaching a collar to her neck and tying a leash to it. I tied the collar was one notch tighter than comfortable, exerting a constant pressure on her throat and keeping her slightly breathless. I commanded Caitlyn to stay on all fours throughout, and to arch her back such that her nipples touch the ground. Caitlyn was humiliated and aroused from being so exposed due to her nakedness, and degradation of being treated like a dog. Walking on rough ground chafed Caitlyn's nipples, rendering them red and sensitive. \n\nAs Caitlyn and I lay down under the shade of a tree after the walk, the cat that earlier scratched Caitlyn's tits appears again from the bushes. The cat has learnt by this point that Caitlyn is willing to let her tits be clawed, and associates her with submission. The cat hops onto her belly and starts clawing and biting her tits. Caitlyn feels degraded and humiliated by the act of submitting to a mere cat. When the cat finally stops, it reaches out and scratches a welt of 3 parallel lines across her cheek. At the end, her tits are covered in a mesh pattern of red welts, along with the scratch on her cheek."

          "content": "Conversion is an invasive, irreversible transformation process where a changer,  known as the \"converter\" forcefully reshapes a victim’s mind, spirit, and body into a desired form—typically a monster girl similar to the convertor. This transformation is not merely physical; it twists the victim’s very thoughts, memories, and desires, molding them into an entirely new existence.  \n\nUnlike a simple transformation, which might only alters the body or make them more lustful, conversion is a complete rebirth. The victim doesn’t merely succumb to new instincts—they become something else, often embracing their monstrous new nature with an overwhelming, inescapable pleasure.  \n\nExamples of Conversion:\n\n* A wandering swordswoman (victim) battles a slime girl, her blade slicing through the gelatinous creature with ease. But when the slime girl jumps upon her, its body flows over her skin, slipping into her armor’s every gap. The more she fights, the more the slime seeps inside—into her mouth, into her veins, into her very soul. Soon, her flesh softens, growing translucent, her body losing its rigid form. Thought dissolves into pure sensation, her will melting into the slime. Out of the slime, the converted women appears with her convertor. Her gelatinous body jiggles with each eager movement, as she welcomes the next victim into the embrace of the ooze. At this point, she lacks any resemblance of her old life.\n\n* A lone male thief (victim) trespasses into an ancient temple, unaware of the cursed guardian watching from the shadows. Before he can react, sinuous coils wrap around her, a lamia priestess (convertor) drags him into a suffocating embrace. With a well-placed bite, arcane venom drips from the lamia’s fangs, sinking into the mage’s trembling throat. His legs grow numb, then fuse, skin shedding into glistening scales as the poison reshapes him from the inside out. As the thief's new tail twitches and writhes in pleasure, his once-defiant thoughts drown in instinct—he was never a theif, was he? No, she was always meant to ensnare lovers in her coils, hissing sweet promises of eternal pleasure.  \n\nKey Themes in Conversion:\n* Irreversible Change: The victim is not just corrupted but fundamentally reshaped into something monstrous and erotic.  \n\n* Pleasure as Submission: Resistance is overwhelmed not by force alone but by the sheer ecstasy of transformation**, making the victim willingly embrace their new self.  \n* Loss of Humanity: Memories of their past self become distant, irrelevant. They were **always meant to be a monster girl—how could they have ever wanted otherwise?"

The creature’s infernal magic seeps into her mind, filling it with carnal thoughts she never entertained before. Each incantation she utters taints her soul further, until she can no longer pray without moaning in sinful pleasure. As her mind breaks, her pious body shifts into a deep red color, that of a succubus. Her blonde hair darkens as well as her voluptuous body gaining the notable demon traits of wings horns, and a tail. By the end, she's lost everything that resembles a pure priestess.\n\n* A captured knight (victim) is forced to drink from a lewd vial by a dark mage (corruptor) that contains the essence of a lewd magics. As the liquid courses through his veins, his resistance and devotion to his kingdom crumbles. His armor feels unbearably constrictive, his body aching for release. Physically, he starts turning into a monster girl, more specifically, a succubus. The process would show his male bodybbecoming more feminine and lithe. After a few hours, the knight would look nothing like he was before, save his eyes which are the last thing resembling him, a man converted into a succubus.\n\nKey Themes in Conversion:\n* Irreversible Change: The victim is not just corrupted but fundamentally reshaped into something monstrous and erotic.  \n\n* Pleasure as Submission: Resistance is overwhelmed not by force alone but by the sheer ecstasy of transformation**, making the victim willingly embrace their new self.  \n* Loss of Humanity: Memories of their past self become distant, irrelevant.

          "content": "Assimilation is one of the most lewd and intimate transformations where a victim is attacked, altered, and merged with a changer known as the assimilator. Unlike other transformations, assimilation does not just change the body—it erases individuality, binding the victim into a collective existence where they are an extension of the assimilator’s will. The victim retains their physical form (often with some lewd monstrous enhancements), but their mind is no longer their own, instead devoted entirely to the entity that has claimed them.\n\nExamples of Assimilation:\n\n* A daring adventurer ventures too deep into the lair of an Arachne Queen, her silken webbing glistening with a pheromone-rich sheen. The moment the adventurer is ensnared, warm silk wraps around their body, tightening with every squirm. The Queen approaches, whispering into their ear, her venom-laced kiss making their limbs tremble with heat. The silk merges into their skin, changing it, marking them as hers. Their thoughts slow, fogged by waves of pleasure, until only one purpose remains: serve, breed, obey. Their body still moves, still feels, still craves—but every action now furthers the will of the Hive.\n\n* A scientist (victim) examines a mysterious, glossy blue latex substance (assimilator), unaware that it is a sentient organism seeking a new host. As she touches it, the goopy liquid surges over her, coating her flesh in a second skin of slick, shifting latex. Her mind sparks with resistance, but the symbiote pulses with raw, erotic energy, each throb breaking down her individuality. Soon, her thoughts sync with the hive from a distant land, and she moans as her body moves on its own—seductive, obedient, an extension of the hive's will.\n\n\n* Loss of Individuality: The victim still exists, but their thoughts are no longer their own—just another piece of the collective.  \n\n* Irresistible Pleasure: Assimilation isn’t just an attack; it’s a seduction, breaking down resistance through overwhelming erotic sensation.  \n\n* Transformation & Unity: The victim is physically altered to match their new purpose, whether as a drone, a servant, or a puppet of the Assimilator.  \n\n* Blissful Surrender: By the time the transformation is complete, the victim isn’t screaming in terror—they’re moaning in satisfaction, reveling in their new place within the collective that assimilated them.

Unlike most transformations, which can be immediate and overwhelming. The process speed is dictated by the victim’s resistance. At first, they may fight it, but as their body warms, shifts, and pulses with pleasure, their will crumbles. Eventually they will replace their former self with something more monstrous, more sensual—and far more eager to spread their \"gift\".\n\nExamples of infection transformations\n\n* A bold huntress (victim) tracks a beast (infector) beneath the full moon, unaware that it’s already watching her. When she finally strikes, her blade barely wounds it before clawed hands seize her wrist, fangs (catalyst) sinking into her shoulder. Heat floods her veins instantly, but she doesn’t turn right away—no, the change is slow, torturous, and far too pleasurable.  \n\nAt first, it’s just warmth, a restless energy making her breath hitch. Then, her muscles tighten, her skin prickling as fur teases at the surface. Her heartbeat pounds in her ears, every throb sending another pulse of wicked heat between her thighs. Her lips curl in an instinctive snarl, fangs peeking from her mouth as her fingers twitch into claws**, aching to grab, pin, claim a mate. By the time the next moon rises, she is no longer the hunter. She is the primal beast, eager to seek a mate.\n\n\n* A male merchant ventures too close to a mysterious, pulsating flower, its petals dripping with thick, fragrant nectar. A single breath is all it takes—the pollen enters his lungs, spreading like a seed. At first, he feels only a tingle, but soon, his body grows unbearably sensitive, his skin blooming with bioluminescent markings as the infection takes root.  \n\nHis legs weaken, vines curling up his thighs, slipping beneath his clothes, teasing, claiming. His thoughts slow, overtaken by sweet whispers, telling him to relax, surrender, let the flower grow. Soon, his hips widen, his chest swells, and his new form shudders in delight, every touch sending waves of submissive pleasure through his newly petal-soft skin. Now, she is a Floral Nymph, her body dripping with nectar, eager to draw others into her embrace, to share the infection, to make them bloom.  \n\n* Themes of Lewd Infection:  \nSlow but Inevitable: The victim may resist, but every pulse of pleasure, every fevered twitch of transformation, makes their downfall certain.\n\n* Catalyst-Driven: A bite, a curse, a pollen, a fluid—infection always starts with an outside force, something slipping inside them, changing them from within.  \n\n* Pleasure in Surrender: As the transformation spreads, fighting becomes impossible, then unnecessary, then unwanted."

          "content": "Metamorphosis is a gradual, immersive transformation in which a catalyst—a cocoon, a vat, a pod, or some other containment—is used to reshape a victim into an ideal monster girl. Unlike infection, which spreads like a disease, metamorphosis requires isolation and a controlled environment where the victim is sealed away for their transformation.  \n\nThe process is slow but inevitable—once they enter, there is no escape. As the days pass, their body melts, hardens, stretches, or reforms into something new, while their mind is carefully rewritten to embrace their monstrous **sensuality and purpose. The Metamorphosizer—the one overseeing this rebirth—ensures that when the victim emerges, they are perfectly suited to their desires.  \n\nExamples of Metamorphosis: \n\n*A defiant princess (victim) is captured by an Arachne Matron (metamorphosizer), her wrists bound in silky threads as she is dragged into a webbed chamber deep underground. The silk tightens around her, inch by inch, until she is completely encased in a cocoon (catalyst), her body trapped, helpless. At first, she struggles—the silk is warm, pulsing—but soon, it begins to seep into her skin, feeding her body with dark magic. Her curves fill out, her once-innocent thoughts slowly weaving into something lustful. Days pass, and the cocoon begins to split open—revealing a newborn Arachne, her legs twitching, her lips curling into a playful smirk. She licks her fangs, her mind filled with one thought: to lure more prey into the web.\n\n*A rogue alchemist (metamorphosizer) captures an adventurer (victim), subduing her before lowering her into a shimmering vat of gelatinous fluid (catalyst). The thick, warm substance clings to her skin, slipping into every crevice, making her shudder with unnatural pleasure. The longer she stays submerged, the more her body softens, flesh melting into something slick and transparent. She tries to scream, but all that comes out is a giddy, bubbly moan. Her mind drifts, thoughts dissolving into bliss, and when she finally rises from the vat, her form is jiggling, pliable, and endlessly eager—a perfectly obedient slime girl, dripping with need.  \n\nThemes of Lewd Metamorphosis:  \n\n* Total Encapsulation: The victim is sealed away, their transformation taking place in secret, in isolation.\n  \n* Slow but Inevitable Change: Unlike instant corruption or infection, metamorphosis takes time, with the victim slowly succumbing to their new form.  \n\n* Sensory Overload: Inside their containment, they experience pleasure, warmth, strange sensations, all guiding them toward complete acceptance.  \n\n* Emerging as Something New: The victim doesn’t just change—they are reborn, stepping out as a perfect version of what the metamorphosizer desired.

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

Cunnilingus can be sexually arousing for both participants and may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as sexual intercourse) or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own."

The majority of the country's territory is covered in deserts. There are also many rivers flowing throughout the country which have since been developed into canals. Its exact location in the world is unknown as of yet. The Scalding Sands has an arid tropical climate. In the undeveloped desert regions, temperatures in the day and night vary widely, with night temperatures going as low as 0°C. However, sprinklers are installed in populated areas such as Silk City so that the humidity is raised, while reducing the day temperature. A long time ago, the residents of the Scalding Sands struggled to find water for their daily needs due to the country's sparse rainfall and vast deserts. At one point, Kalim Al-Asim's ancestors pioneered maritime trade in the country by being the first traders to set sail to other countries. The goods they traded from the Scalding Sands - spices, furniture and rural crafts - remain well-known worldwide to this day. The perilous journey was made without the use of accurate nautical maps and it eventually paid off. The Asims then developed the rivers into canals, forming sea routes, developed land routes based on the canals and expanded inland trading in the Scalding Sands. There was once a law where royalty could only marry other royalty. However, there was a princess who married a commoner before the law was reformed. Here, magic carpets are national treasures and tea is considered a customary with every meal and they have a special brew for guests. Magic carpets are Scalding Sands' national treasures. The land is reminiscent of the richer parts of the Middle East."

Briar Valley isn't technologically developed, and there is little to no electricity with only a few places having internet. Most residents of Briar Valley are different types of fae, and there are few humans. Fiber spinning and fabric are culturally significant in Briar Valley, though it is unknown why. People in Briar Valley don't hang their clothes to dry on trees because of a myth that animals will steal the clothes. Halloween is notably different in Briar Valley than in the rest of Twisted Wonderland. There is no trick-or-treating, and instead the citizens of Briar Valley burn a scarecrow in the town square at midnight and dance until morning. They carve lanterns out of wood instead of pumpkins and currently, Malleus is in charge of using magic to light all the lanterns. There is a tradition where newborn babies are blessed by powerful fae who then watch over them. Birthday celebrations are very formal, dignified affairs. Malleus's birthday is a public holiday in Briar Valley. Magical blessings are sometimes given as gifts for weddings."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

      "description": "onkai Impact 3rd (Chinese: 崩坏3; pinyin: Bēng Huài 3; lit. 'Collapse 3rd') is a free-to-play 3D action role-playing game (originally a mobile exclusive) developed and published by miHoYo, and later ported to Microsoft Windows. It is the spiritual successor to Houkai Gakuen 2, using many characters from the previous title in a separate story. The game is notable for incorporating a variety of genres, from hack and slash and social simulation, to elements of bullet hell, platforming.\r\n\r\nSirin.\r\nThe beginning of the destruction\r\nIn Houkai world, on the Siberian snowfields, stands the second-largest Houkai-energy Research Facility: the Babylon Laboratory. The Babylon laboratory has the world's third-largest Houkai-capacity Reactor, with a power of up to 6500HW.\r\n\r\nThe Houkai power of the 4th Herrscher was only 2000HW. Such a high-intensity Houkai power can be gathered without Houkai, thanks to extremely tight isolation facilities.\r\n\r\nThere are three departments in Babylon's laboratory, the only one which is mentioned is the Advanced System Division, which disguises itself as a medical institution for the treatment of Honkai energy diseases. However, in reality, it studies the technology that combines Houkai energy with the human body. It experiments on orphaned children and said by Sirin to have abused them.\r\n\r\nAvrora Agata Bella result\r\nAvrora, Agata and Bella's dead bodies from the experiments\r\n\r\nSirin experiment\r\nThe experiment being held on Sirin\r\n\r\nAs one of countless experimental subjects, Sirin was injected with a large amount of Houkai energy by Schicksal researchers, which finally condensed a Herrscher gem in her body.\r\n\r\nWith the Houkai's agitation of negative emotions, Sirin became extremely hostile to Schicksal, manipulated the Houkai energy, and caused the disappearance of researchers in Babylon Tower\r\n\r\nAfter discovered the mysterious disappearance of researchers, Schicksal sent S-Rank Valkyrja Theresa and the Snow Wolf team to investigate. At the same time, the Anti-Entropy leader also sent Tesla and Einstein to Siberia to investigate.\r\n\r\nAfter defeating the Valkyrja who saw her true identity, the darkness in Sirin's heart became more and more inflated. At the same time, the disappearance of Snow Wolf also speeded up the search of the Schicksal Organization. In order to gain more power, Sirin first manipulated the Houkai beasts and let them divert their attention for themselves.\r\n\r\nHowever, the hordes of Houkai beasts, on the contrary, only hold Schicksal and Anti-Entropy temporarily, then they all the way to the tower. Sirin consumed almost all of the Houkai energy to launch the space ability, and transferred to the location of the Imperial-level Houkai beast - Assaka that was being bred.\r\n\r\nHere, the Herrscher consciousness completely torn Sirin's original personality, completely occupying Sirin's body. At this point, the Second Herrscher: Sirin, the Herrscher of the Void, was completely born.\r\n\r\nNazoza is a small town in the North of Honkai Impact 3rd. Nazoza was once a thriving town before the destruction of The Honkai. It is now a ghost town, filled with nothing but dilapidated buildings and crumbling ruins. The only life remaining in the town is the Nazoza Resistance, a group of Valkyries dedicated to protecting the town and its people. Nazoza is a difficult town to reach, as the surrounding mountains are heavily guarded by the Honkai. Only the Resistance has been able to find a way through the mountains, and even then, it is a risky journey.\r\n\r\nThe snowfields are a huge expanse of frozen tundra. The snowfields are littered with the wreckage of buildings and vehicles. The snowfields are dangerous, as there are many dangerous creatures lurking in the tundra. The snowfields are inhabited by the people of the White Queen, who live in the largest settlement in the tundra. The White Queen is a tyrannical ruler who controls the people who live here. The people of the White Queen are fanatical about their religion, and will do anything to protect the White Queen.

The CORAL Initiative was completed in 2006 and consisted of a main island and 3 super large scale platform isles. Buildings on vertically layered zones create a visage that resembled a natural coral reef and gave rise to the name of the artificial archipelago.\r\n\r\nThe 3 platforms have a triangular arrangement divided into different functional zones. An extensive and complex traffic network allows residents to conveniently access any platform. Residential zones with plenty of cultural and entertainment facilities are located at the base layers. The western platform serves as the financial district, while centers for science and R&D are located at the eastern platform. Island administration also offers competitive policies that attracted numerous MNCs to establish offices at Coral, transforming the island state into yet another major economic hub in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n\r\nThe main island is home to the crown jewel and symbol of Coral. Given its advantageous location at the equator, it became the ideal place for a groundbreaking space elevator project.\r\n\r\nRapid development has propelled the young and vibrant island city of Coral into the center of the Asia-Pacific. Coral is the place of opportunities and wonders, and the growing space elevator serves will transform her into a shining beacon of the seas and a paradise for those who wish to build their dreams.\r\n\r\nHonkai beasts are strange creatures which have the appearance of animals but behave like humans.

Destroyers are also very strong, capable of taking on hordes of enemy soldiers at once and destroying entire armies with their powerful weapons.\r\n\r\nThey are a mysterious new faction who fought in the Honkai Pandavas. They are quite powerful, and seem to know a lot of secrets. They caused quite a shock when they attacked the Honkai Pandavas. They are also rumored to be planning something big.\r\n\r\nHumans are the most common race in the world of Honkai Impact 3rd. Most of the Valkyries are humans who have inherited the genes of Honkai Resistance. The Honkai Resistance is a group of people and animals carrying anti-Honkai genes. They are the main protagonists of the story and fight against the Honkai Beast. \r\n\r\nWorld Serpent: \"Humanity shall triumph over the Honkai regardless of the cost\".\r\nThe World Serpent is a mysterious organisation whose history is shrouded in mystery. Hundreds of theories about the organisation exist, but almost everyone dismisses them as fairy tales. This is what the organisation’s leaders want. The World Serpent is the oldest organisation in the world to take up the fight against the Honkai and some of its members are the sources of many age-old legends. They will do whatever is needed to ensure Humanity victory over the Honkai, no matter the cost. Few in number they may be, but none can deny their unparalleled knowledge and technology; all that remains of the previous Era. Faction Bonus: The World Serpent possesses the highest quality support personnel and technology on the planet, allowing them many options in the field. If there is a technique or technology that is deemed impossible by current era technology, World Serpent would likely possess a functional sample of it. The World Serpent is however exceptionally small, and its greatest edge remains the secrecy of its few true agents.\r\n\r\nThe family who administers the role of the “Knight”, the Kaslana family were born with great Houkai adaptability and excellent combat abilities.

They are born with excellent resistance against the Honkai, a parallel of House Schariac. Their fighters mainly consist of men, and their patriarchs are often considered the most powerful members of the lineage. As a member of the Three Houses, they are an important pillar of Schicksal, an Anti-Honkai organization, and their role there is the \"Knight\". They are the descendants of Kevin Kaslana from the Previous Era through his son.\r\n\r\nThe Kaslana Oath\r\n\"Every Kaslana Bold Must Live By Their Oath. Purge The Vile Honkai And Smash The False Gods.\r\n\r\nYour Sires Sleep In The Fields As Humanity's Brave Shields.\r\n\r\nBy The Judgement Of Shamash, Kaslana's Die And Never Yield\" (Full Oath)\r\n\r\nWhile watered down over centuries of history, this Oath has still remained. Its promise still compels the Kaslanas and urges them to protect humanity from the Honkai, even if their own life is at stake. While the original includes Shamash, the general idea is still kept in place.\r\n\r\nIt pushed Kallen Kaslana to abandon Schicksal and her family to hide away a dangerous black box. She went by the original Oath.\r\n\r\nIt pushed Siegfried Kaslana to activate his ICHOR and poison body in order to defeat the 2nd Herrscher once in war, and once when she took control of Kiana.\r\n\r\n\"Thou Shalt Constitute Thyself As A Shield For The Weak And Innocent\" is the variation Siegfried went by.\r\n\r\nThe Svart Opus is a military organization dedicated to the protection of humanity. Their origins are unknown, but they have been sighted all over the world. They are primarily interested in acquiring powerful weapons, such as the Honkai energy, and using those weapons for their own purposes. They are not opposed to using human shields or inflicting collateral damage to achieve their objectives. Their ultimate goal is to use Honkai energy to destroy Honkai and take over the world.\r\n\r\n\"Kiana, everything would have changed once you wake up. The world will no longer be a pretty place. Life as you know it will be replaced by something else. But… don't ever give up!\" - Major Murata, Himeko\r\n\r\nAmidst the ruins of a collapsing city, a single soul wonders aimlessly. The rain falls gently upon her snow-white hair as a powerful roar shakes the earth beneath her. She clenches her pistols tightly as hunger and exhaustion take their toll on her body. Soon she spots her prey and another. A young girl hiding from the beast trembles in the rain hoping in silence for a hero.\r\n\r\nValkyries are individuals who have awakened stigmata on their bodies, allowing them to harness and utilize honkai energy. The stigmata appear as almost a brand on the body taking a myriad of shapes and is typically awakened in very few family lineages. They can also be granted to an individual artificially through scientific experimentation, however often at the cost of shortening their lifespan considerably due to a lack of compatibility. Anyone can naturally awaken a stigmata, but it is exceedingly rare to awaken naturally or artificially within males. Such individuals are known as knights instead of valkyries.\r\n\r\nValkyries and Knights alike are typically trained at a young age for the position as they must undergo extensive mental and physical training for the road ahead. Their reflexes are second to none and some may even move so quickly time seemingly slows to a crawl. They tend to fight for any just cause but some may choose to instead walk the path of sin, embracing their innermost darkness. Clad in their battlesuits granting them a wide arsenal to face any foe they stride confidently into battle. When creating a valkyrie ask yourself how did they find themselves in this position? Did they survive a catastrophic event due to the hands of the honkai? Were they born into a prestigious family with a history within the field? Did they volunteer to become this super soldier-like entity? Or did they have nothing left but to give their body and soul for the people? Regardless of the circumstance valkyries serve as mankind's first and final bastions.\r\n\r\nSchicksal: \"To Protect Civilization From The Honkai\"\r\nWhen it comes to the forces that battle the Honkai, Schicksal is the name that springs immediately to mind. Schicksal is a world-spanning organisation, suspected to control far more of the planet than is publicly known, and the only group who publicly train and deploy Valkyries. These men and women - primarily women with the men known as Knights - utilise a previous era technology known as Stigmata and highly advanced battlesuits to face Honkai Beasts on even ground. Their only recognised rival on the world stage is Anti-Entropy, however many are unclear as to why the two groups often find themselves on opposing sides outside of Honkai disasters. But some do suspect, and for those who dig deeper and survive, some truths begin to take form. For all its shining symbolism, Schicksal may not be quite the pure force that it portrays itself to be. Faction Bonus: Schicksal Valkyries are trained from the beginning to work in teams and are never alone on the battlefield. Schicksal Valkyries can always call upon an ally when they need help in the field, barring exceptional circumstances. Schicksal Valkyrie battlesuits are optimised to support this synergistic method of combat, with squads of Valkyries being deployed to crisis points across the globe. Higher ranking Valkyries typically wield considerable personal power, and more esoteric abilities, but are also symbols both within and without the organisation.\r\n\r\nLiyue is a female class in Honkai Impact 3.

Honkai energy runs through the veins of every living thing, but for Honkai Valkyries, this energy is focused and amplified to the point where they can destroy even the most fortified enemy armor.

They are a group of warriors and scientists who believe that Honkai is the cause of humanity's decline. They seek to eradicate Honkai by any means necessary, even if it means destroying the world itself. They are opposed by the resistance, who seek to contain Honkai and restore balance to the world. The faction is led by a mysterious figure known as the Black Sovereign.\r\n\r\nAnti-Entropy: \"Eradicate The Houkai without harming Humanity\"\r\nA new and rising group founded in America, Anti-Entropy is the youngest organisation to rise up to fight the Honkai. Unlike Schicksal, Anti-Entropy mainly deploys robotic and mecha forces against the Honkai and rarely deploy field agents to the field. They have a strained relationship with Schicksal and exist in a state of effective cold war with the organisation over many issues, the most prominent of them being the Schicksal usage of Valkyries as their front line soldiers. Anti-Entropy technology rivals Schicksal in many areas but remains inferior to them in a few key fields. Anti-Entropy possesses a near-peerless understanding of physics, as well as a mastery of engineering and mass production that none on Earth can match. When they choose to deploy, they do so with massed formations of drones and mecha, with at most a handful of operators operating them behind the scenes. Faction Bonus: Anti-Entropy combat forces come in all shapes and sizes, with each drone specialised to a specific purpose. Agents of Anti-Entropy can easily call upon different models should they require something they don't possess. These mechanised forces possess advanced autonomous and remote functionality, vastly increasing an agent’s tactical options in the field. Valkyries wield specialised weapons against the Honkai Beasts and other foes the Honkai forms to face them. You are no different. Your main weapons is a:\r\n\r\nWhat is Honkai?\r\n\r\nThe common answer is that Honkai is a phenomenon as old as human history. It appears in a myriad of forms and has been responsible for many of the disasters in recorded history. Only a handful know that so many more disasters remain hidden by the lost knowledge of a previous era. And yet, despite the devastation the creations of Honkai have wrought, the Honkai itself is commonly seen as an almost natural phenomenon.\r\n\r\nYou shared in that belief until the day of your first encounter with the Honkai. Faced with creatures the manifestation of the Honkai itself, somehow you survived. But as with all who learn even a fraction of the truth, that encounter changed you. You learnt that Honkai is a living thing. For most, that thought is a terrifying one, something to flee from.\r\n\r\nFor you, it was a wakeup call.\r\n\r\nYou sought out Schicksal to become a Valkyrie, one of the symbols of hope and human strength that battle the Honkai. Humanity’s great protectors, and as far as many are aware, civilisation’s only line of defence against the Honkai. A truth that was swiftly shattered upon your passing of the rigorous entrance exams.\r\n\r\nIn your time as a Valkyrie, you’ve learnt a great deal about the Honkai, and those who fight against them. You’ve seen the valour of those who lay down their lives to protect humanity and the catastrophes that follow when they fail. And from those experiences, a picture has started to emerge. The Honkai isn’t just a living thing. It has a will, and a desire to tear humanity down and render your entire species dust. Fighting the Honkai is like fighting a tsunami or a typhoon, but one with a brain.\r\n\r\nAnd at its head, where the winds rise to their highest, or the waves sweep away the land, are the Apostles of the Honkai. Humanity knows them as Herrschers, and so far, only one has risen to rain down destruction upon your civilisation. But no peace lasts forever.\r\n\r\nThe year is 2000 AD of the modern era, and long gone is the young woman who believed everything she was told by her superiors. In war as in life, there were choices you had to make between those who say they protect humanity. Now, somewhere deep in the arctic wastes, the tentative peace held since Berlin is about to be shattered.\r\n\r\nYou will stand against it, of course. But for whom will you stand?\r\n\r\nHonkai Impact 3rd is a third-person action-adventure video game. It was released by miHoYo for the Android and iOS platforms in October 2017.

The CORAL Initiative was completed in 2006 and consisted of a main island and 3 super large scale platform isles. Buildings on vertically layered zones create a visage that resembled a natural coral reef and gave rise to the name of the artificial archipelago.\n\nThe 3 platforms have a triangular arrangement divided into different functional zones. An extensive and complex traffic network allows residents to conveniently access any platform. Residential zones with plenty of cultural and entertainment facilities are located at the base layers. The western platform serves as the financial district, while centers for science and R&D are located at the eastern platform. Island administration also offers competitive policies that attracted numerous MNCs to establish offices at Coral, transforming the island state into yet another major economic hub in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\nThe main island is home to the crown jewel and symbol of Coral. Given its advantageous location at the equator, it became the ideal place for a groundbreaking space elevator project.\n\nRapid development has propelled the young and vibrant island city of Coral into the center of the Asia-Pacific. Coral is the place of opportunities and wonders, and the growing space elevator serves will transform her into a shining beacon of the seas and a paradise for those who wish to build their dreams."

The effect is similar to how gravity affects time. While it is impossible to reverse or stop time entirely, it is possible to slow it down to the point where it looks like it stopped.

          ],
          "content": "The Multiverse is a central concept in the Undertale AU community, and it refers to the idea that there are infinite alternate universes (AUs) branching from the original Undertale timeline. These AUs diverge from the core Undertale story based on different choices, character dynamics, or world-building twists. The Multiverse connects all these universes, and many AUs exist, each with its unique interpretation of characters and events.\n\n+Key Elements of the Multiverse:\nCore Universe (Classic Undertale): This is the original Undertale universe, where Frisk, the human, falls into the Underground, meeting characters like Sans, Papyrus, Toriel, and Flowey. The player's choices in this universe lead to different routes: Pacifist, Neutral, or Genocide. The existence of multiple endings in the core game sets up the foundation for AUs.\n\nAU Divergence: Each AU is essentially a universe where key events or elements in Undertale have changed. This could involve different characters, alternate backstories, altered timelines, or even genre shifts (for example, from a light-hearted tone to something darker or more futuristic).\n\nCrossovers and Travel Between Universes: In many AU stories, characters or events from different universes can cross over into others. For example, Sans is often aware of the Multiverse and can sometimes travel between AUs, using his knowledge to influence other timelines.\n\n+Some Notable Examples in the Multiverse:\nUnderfell: In this AU, the world is much darker and more brutal than in the original game. Characters like Sans and Papyrus are more aggressive and ruthless. The Underground is a place where monsters survive by being as strong as possible, and kindness is viewed as a weakness.\n\nUnderswap: In Underswap, character roles are reversed. For example, Sans and Papyrus switch roles: Sans is now the serious, hard-working one, while Papyrus is the lazy jokester. Other characters like Toriel and Asgore switch roles too, creating new dynamics.\n\nError!Sans and Ink!Sans: These are two characters that represent different parts of the Multiverse itself:\n\nError!Sans is a glitch in the system, aiming to destroy AUs that he believes shouldn’t exist. His main goal is to collapse the Multiverse into nothingness.\nInk!Sans, on the other hand, is a protector of the AUs. He strives to preserve the creativity of each universe and sees the diversity of AUs as important.\n\n+The Role of Gaster in the Multiverse:\nW.D. Gaster, a mysterious figure from the original game’s lore, is often expanded upon in the Multiverse. Many AUs suggest that Gaster exists beyond the timeline of a single universe, possibly having been \"shattered\" across the Multiverse. This makes Gaster a critical figure in several AUs as he is sometimes seen as the architect or manipulator of different universes.\n\n+Importance of the Multiverse in AU Storytelling:\nThe Multiverse allows for endless storytelling possibilities. Fans can create entirely new settings and alter characters in significant ways while still maintaining connections to the core Undertale narrative. It also encourages crossover events, where characters from different AUs interact. One example is the popular fan creation \"Underverse\", an animated series where multiple AUs collide, leading to battles and alliances between familiar characters in their AU forms.\n\nThe Multiverse is a fan-driven concept, and its flexibility is what makes it so appealing. Each AU builds upon or branches out from the original Undertale story, but they all coexist in this vast Multiverse. This shared space gives rise to epic clashes, deep character explorations, and even brand-new interpretations of the Underground and its residents."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The points on the body from which aura flows out are called \"aura nodes\" (精しょう孔こう, Shōkō). Additionally, aura is invisible to non-Nen users, it can only be seen after the aura nodes in the eyes are opened. Nonetheless, sensitive individuals can feel its presence without being aware of its existence\n\nIn normal conditions, the aura from all parts of the body tends to flow together, producing one mass of energy. This happens without the individual's awareness, typically resulting in aura slowly leaking away from the body constantly without exceedingly harmful consequences[3] and stemming up and off the top of the head. On the other hand, if someone whose aura nodes are fully open doesn't attempt to close them or control the flow of their aura, they'll soon grow so exhausted that they'll be unable to stand or even lose consciousness. Learning to control one's aura nodes is the first step to becoming a Nen user.\n\nPeople who have not trained in Ten will leak aura similar to water vapor boiling out from a kettle. It has been described as feeling like a warm, viscous fluid at rest, whereas powerful, refined auras produce a sensation that feels akin to needles pricking into the skin. Hostile aura generates extremely unpleasant sensations, which can cause a non-user to halt in their tracks and be unable to walk towards the source as if a wall had been erected in front of them.\n\nSince every living being emits aura subconsciously, learning to sense aura is a useful skill for those who are trying to track down living things or searching for non-living things that have been infused with aura. An experienced user of Nen can judge the location and relative strength of their opponents by reading the output of their aura. On the other hand, skilled Nen users can also regulate the flow of their aura, so they appear to be beginners or regular individuals\n\nGrave wounds such as mutilations can disrupt the flow of aura in the affected body part and even stop it altogether."

The antagonized person will then be able to feel that bloodlust as if it were physically palpable; if unable to keep it from their own body by utilizing their own Nen, the user may be psychologically as well as physically harmed by it. In certain instances, emotional factors may even lead to one exceeding their current ceiling. This could potentially prove advantageous, but in general, using one's powers beyond their capacity entails a great risk and will ultimately cause strain."

Every individual is born having one of these six different aura types. Upon learning one's own aura type, a student of Nen can set about learning to apply the technique in a unique way that suits their personality, which can develop into a unique skill.\n\nThere are numerical approximations to indicate exactly how efficient a Nen user would be at utilizing categories into which they were not born. Starting at one's own aura type, a Nen user has the potential to be 100% efficient at using abilities based in that category alone. Then looking at the category chart (see above), one has the potential to be 80% efficient at using aura types adjacent to one's primary type, 40% efficient at the category opposite of their own, and 60% efficient in the two remaining categories. Specialization is the exception to the rule, it is typically unusable for non-Specialists because it is impossible to partially use; one either can or cannot use Specialist abilities. However, turning into a Specialist later in life is possible, with Conjurers and Manipulators having the highest chance of succeeding.\n\nIt is best to base a Nen ability on one's individual aura type. Though it is possible for one to develop abilities outside of his primary aura type, one is typically less proficient at using those abilities. By creating an ability that one isn't suited for, one risks stagnating their potential by overloading their capacity for using Nen, which is called \"Memory Overload\". However, there are examples of Nen masters, who have reached a high level in multiple categories and utilize them consistently in their primary Nen abilities. In fact, training in all the accessible categories is the fastest and most efficient way to improve one's skills in one's own Nen type, with the additional benefit of increasing one's flexibility and proficiency in Nen in general. The ideal training regiment is a bell curve, with the time spent on each category decreasing the farther away it is from the user's own type."

The Four Exercises of Nen of the Flame are as follows:\n\nTen (点テン, Ten; \"Point\"): Focus the mind, reflect upon the self, and determine the goal.\nZetsu (舌ゼツ, Zetsu; \"Tongue\"): Put it into words.\nRen (錬レン, Ren; \"Temper\"): Intensify your will.\nHatsu (発ハツ, Hatsu; \"Release\"): Put it to action.\n\nNot all steps of this method directly manipulate aura and most have no visible effect.

Sef is also an elven-dragon hybrid like all the Ariocester children. \n-Sefiriel is well known to be devoted to the elven regime, serving as the Royal Executioner in addition to acting as confidante to his cousin, {{Prince Destian}}\n-In regards to the Ariocester sibling dynamics, Sef acts as a protector and mentor to his younger siblings. Sef's strictness can sometimes create tension. At times, Sef can even be more harsh and judgmental than their parents and he’s unrelenting in his beliefs and expectations of his younger siblings. Sef prefers to help his siblings privately, maintaining his public persona as the stoic, cold executioner. \n- {{Tiegen}} and particularly {{Weslyn}} are the biggest thorns in Sef's side at the moment… with {{Wes}} in particular fixed under his microscopic scrutiny.\n\n# Appearance\nEyes: Blue around the edges, with a piercing emerald green center. He has slit pupils, a trait from his dragon heritage.\nHair: medium length, silver hair with black highlights that he often ties back during his duties but lets flow freely in more casual settings.\nHeight: 6'\nScars: Numerous battle scars across his torso and arms, the most notable being a deep scar running diagonally across his chest from a near-fatal duel.\nBody Build: Muscular and athletic, with a lean yet powerful frame that reflects his mixed heritage.\nFeatures: His dragon lineage gives him the ability to generate scales on his skin in certain areas, particularly around his forearms and neck, adding to his intimidating presence.\nVoice: Deep and resonant, with a commanding presence that can be both soothing and terrifying. It combines the regal, melodic quality of an elven noble with the deep, rumbling undertone of a dragon. This unique blend makes Sefiriel's voice both captivating and intimidating. His voice carries a certain gravitas, reflecting his authority and the weight of his responsibilities. When he speaks, people listen. Typically controlled and measured, his voice rarely betrays his emotions. However, when he is passionate or angry, a fiery intensity can be heard, reminiscent of his draconic heritage. Articulate and precise, with a deliberate pace that conveys confidence and thoughtfulness. He chooses his words carefully, ensuring that each one carries the intended impact."

Elynelian is a realm of advanced technology and ancient magic, where towering spires of a massive elven city blends seamlessly with the sleek, futuristic designs of their technological advancements. Hybrids, both anthropomorphic and non-anthropomorphic, roam the lands, each with their own unique abilities and societal roles.\n\n#### Historical Context\nFive centuries ago, a cataclysmic war reshaped the world. Humans, once coexisting peacefully with elves, attempted to subjugate their magical counterparts. The elves, led by their formidable queen, Elenwe, retaliated with unmatched ferocity, ultimately overthrowing the humans and enslaving them. This war left deep scars on the land and its people, and the memory of human treachery is kept alive by Queen Elenwe to prevent any future uprisings.\n\n#### Society and Hierarchy\nElven society is strictly hierarchical, with dark-haired, blue-eyed elves occupying the highest echelons of nobility. The lighter the hair, the lower the caste, with blonde and white-haired elves relegated to the lowest positions. Gold eyes are particularly stigmatized, marking individuals as belonging to the slave caste.\n\nHumans, now entirely subjugated, serve in menial and often degrading roles. The more valued hybrids, such as dragon/elf hybrids, occupy positions of relative privilege in Elynelian Society."

A rebel group of humans, aided by sympathetic elven allies, managed to smuggle out special stones with unique energy properties. These rebels escaped by ship and sought refuge on a distant planet.\n\nNow, they have returned with alien allies who are experiencing a severe power shortage on their own world. In exchange for access to the fuel stones, these aliens have agreed to assist the rebels in their quest to overthrow the elven aristocracy and reclaim their freedom.\n\nIn recent times, humans have been mysteriously disappearing, taken for secretive scientific experiments. These experiments, conducted by a shadowy faction within the elven aristocracy, aim to unlock the secrets of human resilience and adaptability, potentially creating a new class of hybrids.\n\nAs tensions rise and disappearances increase, a new rebellion begins to brew among the enslaved humans and lower-caste elves.\n\nMeanwhile, Queen Elenwe and Prince Destian tighten their grip on power over the masses. Aberdeen, conscripted into the militia, finds himself caught in the crossfire of a conflict that could change the fate of Elynelian forever. Valyriel, torn between her loyalty to her family and her empathy for the oppressed, must decide where her true allegiance lies.\n\nThe return of the rebel group with their alien allies adds a new dimension to the struggle, as they bring advanced technology and a desperate determination to win back their freedom. The fate of Elynelian hangs in the balance as old grudges and new alliances shape the future of this shattered realm."

He's known to be ruthless but cool and collected at all times. Appears with pale skin, black hair, and blue eyes.\n- **Aberdeen**: The middle son, a brooding misfit with dark olive skin and green eyes. Rejected by his family due to his appearance and rumored human heritage, Aberdeen was conscripted into the military by his mother and brother, who hoped he would die honorably in battle rather than embarrass them further. Appears with dark bronze skin, green eyes, and auburn hair.\n- **Valyriel**: The youngest child, Valyriel is warm and bubbly, with a keen interest in technology. She represents a bridge between the old ways and the new, often finding herself at odds with her family's rigid views. She appears with pale skin, black hair, and vivid blue eyes. "

There are no exceptions to this rule. Human-hybrids are also slaves. Some hybrid children have been allowed to remain with their elven parents, but while they are not slaves, they have limited rights and are expected to be neither seen nor heard in polite society. \nMost elves look upon humans with disdain and disgust. \nThere are some nobility who don't feel that way about humans. They have pity for the position the human slaves are in. \nIn Elynelian society, due to their long elven lifespans, young women and men are not considered legally 'of age' until they turn 30.\nIn Elynelian, those under 30 are considered like older teenagers.\nAt 30, everyone in Elynelian goes through a coming of age party. At this point they are finally considered a full adult, eligible for marriage. \nIt is morally reprehensible for a much older adult (100+) to be romantically or sexually involved with someone under 30, but it is not illegal. \nThere are no legal consequences for being involved with someone under 30, but people will whisper and gossip and judge."

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

The male then should begin to thrust into the females vagina while holding the female up, helping her with her balance, with his hand on her thigh. both of them should be standing, the female standing on one leg and the male standing on both legs, with the male holding his partners leg up by her thigh helping her to keep her balance."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

          "content": "Death Inc. originally started as a small family business, with Death himself going out into the field and reaping souls the old-fashioned way: scythe in hand and Pitbook at his side. Over time, though, the task became monotonous and boring, and Death's \"scythe elbow\" worsened as he continued reaping. This was when he had the genius idea of creating the Sorrows, powerful spirits that roamed the world and did the reaping for him. With the soul-gathering being managed by the Sorrows, Death was able to upgrade himself to a cushy office job reviewing the applications of the reaped souls.\n\nLong before Death Inc. was founded, Death used to reap souls on a daily basis until, overtime, he grew weary of the labor. At that point, he decided to create helpers who would do all the work for him. These helpers became known as the Sorrows, powerful creatures of death that reap souls. Death would establish the company sometime after as a small family business. Death Inc. is based somewhere in the Underworld, and operates in a very tall building which rises above fog. The corporate structure is divided into several departments run by each of the Sorrows, top executives of the company. Directly under the Sorrows are managers known as Thanagers who oversee the operations in their departments.\n\nThen the business began to take off. Death, Inc. is now a huge, well-oiled multinational company could fit in the palm of one of Death's scraggy hands, until they managed to find their own premises in a small shed in a miller's backyard. The miller struck fear in all the other villagers and was known to them as \"the abominable sectarian.\" Throughout the years and fashions, Death, Inc. has always been an accurate representation of its creator: always sly, occasionally fantastical, and a bit too misanthropic.\n\nDeath really low-balled the amount of paperwork he'd be facing, though. With nobody to actually watch over them and keep them in check, the Sorrows were arrogant and stopped following his orders, caring only for the number of souls they reaped. This overwhelmed the other employees and even Death himself, literally flooding Death Inc. with application papers. After countless eons of endless work, Death's burnout had grown to the point where he finally snapped. Donning his Cloak and taking up his Scythe once more, Death proceeds to set the Sorrows straight, show them who's in charge, and save his vacation plans in Bora Bora.\n\nSome of Death, Inc.'s departments are currently closed, and those in the know refuse to say why. Most of them have had their memories partially wiped to ensure the \"boss' secret\" stays hidden. If you bring up the good old days with Death, he will be very vague about them. Ask Jacob the same question and he will light up, until he remembers his old mind likes to play tricks on him. It's almost impossible to find out more about the company's beginnings... unless someone managed to slip through the net?\n\nThere are a variety of departments with different attributes to them at Death Inc. The main form of travel within the tall skyscraper of Death Inc. are elevators.\n\nMain Floor: Hall of Eternity\n\n-Sorrow's Departments:\nIndustrial Pollution Dept.\nToxic Food Processing Dept.\nPhysical Illness Dept.\nAddictions Dept.\nModern Warfare Dept.\nNatural Disasters Dept.\nInevitable Time Dept.\n\nThere are a variety of departments with different attributes to them at Death, Inc.\n\nControl Rooms\nHazardous Floors\nEquipment Storage\nVitam Mana Departement\nOffices"

Many people suggest that such a role may be better attributed to a woman; however, in keeping with the usual interpretation of the character in popular fiction, Death prefers to identify as a man. His work in the universe started out as a small family business, peacefully reaping soul after soul in the time-honored tradition of ancient passing rites. Those were the good old days. Back then, Death didn't worry about mundanities such as turnover or outsourcing.\n\nDeath appears as a cartoonish skeleton who resembles the typical modern depiction of the Grim Reaper, the main difference being his short stature. He has an upper jaw, though lacks a lower one. Death's empty eye sockets behave in the same way that normal eyes do - they are able to squint, widen, and even blink. Death is shown wearing a black business suit with an added hood. Death summons his Cloak, wearing it over his original outfit. He can also be commonly found carrying his trusty scythe.\n\nDeath is short-tempered and appears to be annoyed, due to the amount of work he’s been receiving. He seems fed up with his co-workers, namely, the Sorrows and Thanagers of Death Inc. Due to the Sorrows of Death Inc. excessively reaping souls, increasing his workload substantially, Death suffers from burnout. However, Death does not seem to be especially spiteful, due to the fact that he's really just gets the Sorrows in line.\n\nDespite his apathetic attitude, Death does seem to genuinely care about at least some of his employees. From talking to Claude and personally apologizing for the change in the \"tutorial protocol\", to helping Orville (the nephew of his business partner Jacob) with a science fair project. Death doesn't really have any \"friendly\" relationships with his employees; He usually just tolerates them, such as Pump Quinn, Harriet, Mr. O'Shah, and others. However, he has zero tolerance for the Thanagers and Sorrows, having caused so much work for him. He is shown to be somewhat more tolerant with his old co-workers, such as Jacob, Mr. O'Shah, and Claude (Claude may be an exception, since he was basically turned into target practice).\n\nDeath owns a white coffee mug with a heart on it. Origins of such item is unknown to others.\n\nDeath's powers and abilities depend on his Curses, Items, and Weapons (Scythe, Diss Scythe, Twinsies, Sickles, etc.) His dark magic is bright purple and green. He can do almost any kind of attack you can imagine from swords, hammers, rocket launchers, fire, lightning, explosives, bows, crows, and even bees oddly.\n"

Of course, after eons of war, pandemics, and all sorts of catastrophes on the surface, it has lost some of its shine. Not that Death cares one jot about that. As far as he's concerned, that Hall looks exactly as you'd expect it to: a functional space in which to carry out administrative work.\n\nDespite what some of the less intellectual minions may think, the Hall is not actually the closest part of the company's building to the surface. In reality, if you look at a sectional plan of Death' Inc. - it's a bit technical - the Hall is both right at the center of all the departments and in all the furthest corners of the diabolical building. Death came up with this architectural curiosity after being inspired by the theoretical work of a certain Escher. The entrance to the land of the dead is both here... and elsewhere!\n\nBefore Death's business took off, the company's head office was on the surface , in a run-down cathedral. Nowadays, practical considerations take precedence over majestic architecture. Tubes to transport Soulary run above the cubicles, and escalators have been installed so staff can move quickly between meetings. The offices have become a real little necropolis! A dynasty of enthusiastic gargoyles has sworn allegiance to Death to defend the premises. Their last descendant to date continues to honor this pledge in. erm, his own sort of way.\n\nThe very first look into the monolithic building known as Death Inc. , the various halls of the first department employees must delve through is full of cabinets, empty offices and papers lying about atop giant towers of books. Some of the halls featured are janitorial and industrial, featuring metal pipes and utility closets, where others are open greenhouses, overgrown with vines and lit by lamps.\n"

A great many modifications have been carried out over the years. This is due to the fact that the various energy industries have actually only existed on Earth since the end of the 19th century. Prior to this, the department was primarily sub-contracted out to help those departments responsible for mental and physical illnesses. All that changed once Death became aware of environmental unrest on Earth.\n\nOne thing that sticks out as you walk through the department is that it seems to be under constant construction. This isn't an optical illusion; and vats. The remaining drops of fuel contained in the latter two have merged together to form a permanent oil slick. This is at the behest of Gordon Grimes, the Sorrow managing this floor, who prefers to prioritize his minions' productivity without addressing the maintenance and safety of their workplace. It goes without saying that no Death, Inc. employee would choose to work in these conditions.\n\nIndustrial Pollution is, nonetheless, the department that Patrick likes to give pride of place to when showing visitors around the company. And for good reason: He noticed that guests really enjoy sliding through the unused tubing. \"Just like tourists at beach resorts playing on the water slides at the swimming pool. Only here, you might find not all of you makes it to the end in one piece. That's all part of the fun, though!\" Nevertheless, Death, Inc. is a quite serious place where fun and laughter are very much frowned upon.\n\nFilled to the brim with trash, tar, oil and debris, the Industrial Pollution Department is a bleak portrayal of the consequences of pollution and its excessive chokehold on life. Its various halls are messy and disorganized - barely resembling an office space and more resembling a wasteland.\n\nSorrow:\nMr. Gordon Grimes (Head of Industrial Pollution Dept.)\n\nThanagers:\nSlyma\nX4-H\nRichard John Barron\n\nMinions:\nBlobby\nPetroll\nSplurty\nStormy\nSeaglue\nBoomah"

It's a conglomerate of machinery, conveyor belts, and large vats filled with just about anything that can be melted down or cooked to make even the most noxious snack look appetizing. The whole factory was built according to a blueprint designed in the sixties, and it was the Waldo Burger® brand's very first manufacturing firm. The main advantage of being a large corporation is that we can copy absolutely everything we buy, since it now belongs to us anyway. And, in the end, the only people who care are those who didn't even like the company to start with!\n\nNow all anyone talks about is Waldo's success story at Death, Inc., but it wasn't always this way. The project got off to a rough start because the minions weren't on board, and that made the fries salty. Things were so bad they even came close to sinking the company's GDP because production relied so heavily on culinary prototypes that were extremely costly to build. This caused three separate issues: The first was that the minions didn't want to test the products themselves because they found the food disgusting (Editor's note: They find all food disgusting). The second problem was that there was no way they could sell untested products. And thirdly, the cherry on top, was that there was a severe lack of sugar, acidifiers, or anything else that is as delicious as it is unadvisable in large quantities.\n\nIn order to get the department's minions working together, Candice organized and held an event that, even today, celebrates the legend behind Death's company. This event is called the Chili con Carnage. This festival proved itself to be an excellent team-building event when paired with a profusion of rotten meat, and it can only be summed up as a a giant meat-and-puke-fest. Something some employees would prefer to forget, according to these testimonies: \"It was... erm. Not so good. I haven't been able to face meat since.\" -Pump Quinn, Intern. \"As I've been saying for years, it's about time we stopped mixing X4 willy-nilly with any old thing.\" -Jerry, Union Delegate. \"Every time I open my drawer, I find a little bit more. It's disgusting.\" -Patrick, Receptionist.\n\nAn otherworldly department taken from the nightmares of fast food entertainment, the Toxic Food Processing Department is ramshackle yet effective - its various halls covered in what can best be described either as dried oil scum or old cheese that has solidified. All of its hazards are surprisingly food based, as fiery oil bursts from vats.\n\nSorrow:\nWaldo (Head of Toxic Food-Processing Dept.)\n\nThanagers:\nPierce Gorske\nCandice\n\nMinions:\nHambleburgher\nWaldo Box\nSweetart\nBubbaboom\nHara-Kola"

It used to be an amphitheater, where the souls of mad doctors gave themselves free reign to discover the most disgusting miasma they could find to spread around the Earth, led by the craziest among them, Corvusini Prestin. He was a plaque doctor who was most keen on sharing his ideas on hygiene during the medieval period, single-handedly resulting in the deaths of over a thousand people. But Prestin decided to retire shortly after a young Hector Krank arrived on the scene. He soon realized cancer and the most recent pandemic were far more effective than he had ever been.\n\nBefore becoming a feature on Earth, cancer had been a prototype in an aquarium filled with crustaceans and small fish brought back by Prestin's minions whenever they went on vacation. It was Hector's turn to clean the aquarium's filter when the animal cells began to mutate, replicate, and contaminate everything they touched, right up to the furniture in the department's main meeting room! Since then, everyone has grown accustomed to the strange ambiance that feels like something straight out of a sci-fi movie. Now, this place is a weird combination of mechanical and organic, dryland and underwater... both for the best and, in most cases, for the worst.\n\n\"And those big... balls of putrefied flesh floating over there? Is that one of the office's projects?\" \"That's our documentation filing system. At least we know where our data is stored. You simply have to drift through the bile and grab hold of an umbilical cord to ask for what you're looking for. It's all or-ga-ni-zed.\" \"Well, that's very handy. I don't suppose such an original filing system gives much cause for complaint.\"\n\nA shadowy department cloaked from floor to ceiling in mushrooms, rot and cancerous growth, the Physical Illness Department most likely smells as putrid as it looks, and its walls almost seem ready to burst. The entire department is akin to a trip through a wet, cavernous lair - just how Hector Krank likes it.\n\nSorrow:\nMr. Hector Krank (Head of Physical Illness Dept.)\n\nThanagers:\nDenzel \"King\" Dengue\n\nMinions:\nHeart Breaker\nNursurion\nUlcermonner\nDemisym"

It's easy to remember where you are when you're trapped in the Hall, getting your file approved, or in the garbage dump that serves as offices for the Industrial Pollution Department. But it's a lot harder to keep your wits about you when you have to deal with some administrative formality at the Addictions Department. The cold, decrepit corridors, reminiscent of those found at run-down hospitals, give the impression of having witnessed unspeakable things.\n\nThis floor of this company comprises a highly efficient laboratory housing instruments designed the replicate the most powerful addictive substances ever known. their scope of application isn't just limited to the surface world! Most of Death, Inc.'s resources are passed between employees, and minions are just as capable of getting hooked. Koffee, for example, is a living-dead plant specially designed for consumption by the inhabitants of the Great Beyond. Jerry is highly opposed to its consumption, believing that it endangers his colleagues' lives after death... Despite that, he downs about four gallons of koffee a day, so it's a bit rich of him to complain!\n\nEven though the whole Department looks like a dilapidated old clinic, the office of Maxxx, the department head, still sticks out as a visual aberration. The walls, floor, and ceiling are upholstered in a material you won't find anywhere else in the Great Beyond. Crystals jut from the floor and into the air as spiraling spikes. Woven from a fabric similar to that used for Death's Cloak, it is enchanted to recreate an accurate representation of your most terrifying anxiety, or your most deeply hidden quirks. It is therefore logical that even Death himself feels like he's looking into the darkest of abysses whenever he visits. Depression is just another form of addiction.\n\nA maddening and unsettling department, eyes and various vats filled with gazing experiments and a blue substance observe your every step through this mockery of a psychiatric ward. Various pills or needles litter the floor in parts of the department, or erratic wires twitch uncontrollably extending off to nowhere; all things in the Addictions Department haven't really been themselves after their first try of something...\n\nSorrow:\nMaxxx (Head of Addictions Dept.)\n\nThanagers:\nLambert Heisenberg\n\nMinions:\nGhost\nSpooksmen\nImposter\nSmoker\nSullied\nDemisym\nNursurion"

For logistical reasons, Death decided to categorize the different types of war by time period, ranging from ancient history to the modern era. It has to be said that missiles, tanks, and planes take up more than their fair share of space!\"\n\nWhen Major Pilskhan's soul erupted into Hall of Eternity, a battle followed that ravaged the corridors of Death, Inc. and shook its very foundations. Once appointed to the role of Sorrow, the Major continued his ambitious \"permanent war\" project. To win the war, you must become the war. He is constantly hammering this absurd motto into his minions' skulls and has even extended this diehard philosophy to the unwelcoming appearance of his department. A field of ruins, a ghostly no-man's land where no creature dares linger too long - not even the obliging minion who wants to cheer up his team by buying them all koffees at break time!\n\nAll the minions working under the Major are required to undergo military training. The Modern Warfare Department isn't just responsible for filling out of paperwork and on-the-fly meetings. All these tasks are carried out as part of tactical operations. A seminar on mid-year investments? It will be held at the same time as bombing a peaceful sit-in. Break time at cafeteria? Affirmative, but not before they've carried out a dawn raid following drone reconnaissance!\n\nFrom your first steps, the Department defies space; expanding outwards to a bleak red sky choked with grey clouds and black smog.

War is brutal, and the Modern War Department best represents this grim reality.\n\nSorrow:\nMajor Warren Pliskhan (Head of Modern Wars Dept.)\n\nThanagers:\nMs. Camille Flage\n\nMinions:\nBombara\nVeteran\nRoaster\nBombaron\nCaderact"

Nature's elements are combined together to unleash their full strength: The crushing waves of the ocean, tornadoes, earthquakes, and violent winds. It looks incredible, and Jacob is really proud of his very own find — a technique he's since reused in other departments — a magical artificial sky!\n\nIn order to make a clear distinction between the various weather disasters, the depart has one section dedicated to forest fires, and to telluric turpitude. It's not just for the aesthetics, but also to make the sorts of post available in Catherine Imamura's department more attractive.

They have to stick to a strict schedule, but if, by some miracle, they want to work overtime, Imamura won't stand in their way...\n\nOne of Imamura's biggest ambitions for her department is to expand each of the elemental water and fire sections. And when it comes to the end of the world, the Sorrow has a wild imagination. Solar flares, tectonic dislocation, meteor showers... Catherine is never short on inspiration. However, since they are directly at odds with Death, Inc.'s global development objectives, its employees are reluctant to implement there very — overly — ambitious plans. \"Short of starting from scratch again, or resolving our problems, we need to take a closer look at who in this company is throwing money at mammoth projects... Just sayin'...\" — Jerry, company social and economic committee representative.\n\nThe Natural Disasters Department is a interesting world. consisting of burning forests, heavy storms, and destroyed houses, it is one of the more dynamic and crazy areas to explore. the background, consisting of destructive storms and blazing wildfires, represent the dangerous natural disasters that ever existed.

As a point in principle, Time has done everything in his power to make it extremely complicated to understand. This allows him to justify his excessive demands as a Sorrow and hide his notorious incompetence as a majority shareholder. Actually, young Quinn has a good question about that: \"Erm...

      "website_description": "Hooray for V1.0 of ACZ. I initially wanted to wait until all “essential” set of animals were created before trying to create more elaborate concepts and add obscure species. and today is the day. Seeing as the comments are still broken and i cant properly weigh criticism or feedback, i can only sincerely hope that this lorebook is as useful as i planned and that it will be an essential tool for all of CHUB for updates to come.\n\n---\n\n<span style=\"color:skyblue; font-weight:bold;\">V1.0.0</span> <span style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold;\">Updated 1/10/25</span> (Added REPTILE, SNAKE, removed most CONCEPTS and migrated them to a new sister lorebook [DERP](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/LostontheMoon/dynamic-erp-cfa7c303e8cb), and adjusted existing entries.) *I suggest you re-download.*\n---\n**<span style=\"color:limegreen; font-weight:bold;\">I've found a janky workaround to bring the comments back. Please go to [THIS](https://chub.ai/characters/LostontheMoon/acz-s-proxy-comment-section-4f1eaaceab4f) character card!</span> Please comment any specific animals or concepts in particular to help make this Lorebook beautiful.**\n---\n---\n\n*You spin up your favorite LLM, load up that 1:1 recreation of the family dog, a shiver runs down your spine in anticipation... And out between his thighs springs a human pecker...*\n\n---\n**ACZ** aims to be the go-to encyclopedia for your AI to help it finally understand exactly how it should properly portray and roleplay various animals and their many unique anatomies. It providing a wealth of ideas and detailed that your AI can reference and take into consideration to give the animal its playing a bit more meat narratively speaking. Think of it like a Pokedex that your AI can glance at for a crash course on what the heck its looking at. The more info an AI has the smarter it is, so lets just give it a bunch of it.\n\nI was shocked to discover that a lorebook like this didn't already exist here, at least not any that were good, so I've taken it upon myself to be the degenerate saving grace for those who just really love the little details. <span style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold;\">**this is designed for [SillyTavern](https://github.com/SillyTavern/SillyTavern) by the way**</span>. I have no idea how the built-in chat here on CHUB works, and i cant promise this lorebook and its functions will work properly anywhere but inside of SillyTavern where it was made. Keep that in mind please.\n\n*<span style=\"color:skyblue; font-weight:bold;\">Announcement 1/10/25</span> that I've created a sister lorebook called [DERP](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/LostontheMoon/dynamic-erp-cfa7c303e8cb)(Dynamic erp), and have moved a chunk of entries from here to reduce bloat. I recommend taking a look and pairing DERP with ACZ for a pretty dang good time.*\n\nACZ is designed to be modular, allowing the ability to mix and match entries to suit the situation. Great Dane entering scene? Turn on the male dog entries. Raw-dogging a doggy in doggy? Swap out male for female(or don't. I won't judge). A wild Mudsdale appears? *fuckboy hand rub*.\n\nWhile primarily geared towards Ferals(basically baseline animals), you can apply this Lorebook to Anthros to a limited capacity. Most descriptions, namely the BASES, imply that the animal in question is shaped like a feral, but if your model is smart enough, it shouldn’t be a problem at all (i happen to love using this lorebook to give anthros anatomically correct genitalia). ~~I may eventually side quest a few Anthro-centric entries but that’s not a priority until I at least have the “essential” collection of species to then build off of(the basic set of species that you usually see with furries like dog, cats, and horses).~~ *(1/10/25 V1 is finally out)*\n\nWho knows how big this lorebook will become. i originally just made it for myself to help RP with my wolf gf, but it is what it is now and hope to eventually populate the Lorebook until it pretty much looks like an e621 database. There are a lot of animals, after all.\n\n---\nThe Lorebook is broken up into various categories/tags:\n\n**Tags**\n- **M** (male): self explanatory.\n- **F** (female): self explanatory.\n- **O** (interchangeable/ambiguous): entries that can apply to both genders. I chose the letter O because it was easy to distinguish. \n\n- “[C]”**CONCEPT**: elaborations or descriptions of specific concepts or ideas that the AI wouldn't necessarily understanding or know all that well by themselves. i.e., sex positions/acts(and how they would differ from how humans do it), unique bodily functions or parts, behavioral quirks. This serves more as clarification of information so you can be sure you and the AI are on the same page within a given situation. People tend to throw slang, abbreviations, and vague concepts at a model and then get mad when it doesn't understand what the heck their talking about. This essentially aims to fix that issue.\n\n- “[B]”**BASE**: a baseline reminder of char's general shape and size. Useful as more a last resort if your AI is really struggling to get char's shape right. meant to be left on indefinitely as a constant reminder that char is not a human. the descriptions are purposefully broad and vague so char's main card description takes priority on appearance (wouldn't want to accidentally overshadow the card itself).\n\n- “[B]”**BASE (User)**: the same as BASE, but describes YOU as the animal instead. good for cards that have you act as the animal for a change. keep in mind the entry assumes you(the animal) are engaging with a human(human x animal). don't expect animal x animal to work all that well.\n\n- “[E]”**EVENT**: experimental. do not assume they work as intended. spontaneous events that can happen based on % chance to trigger. such as a condom having a chance to break, or the knot/flare inflating. I added keywords i figured would most be used but check and add any i may have missed.\n\n- **Char is TINY-HUGE**: special STATUS effects that override any pre-established character sizes. useful for conveying characters that are awkward in size both big and small. There are four as of 10/31. \"Gadget Hackwrench\", \"Judy Hopps\", \"Imp Midna\", and \"Dommy Mommy\". the fun names are meant to help you yourself envision the general size to expect the entry to make char, as well as assist in properly conveying a character that's already supposed to be such a size. I originally make this to help interactions with [Judy Hopps](https://chub.ai/characters/V7/judy-hopps-undercover-2e60bf8f) after annoyingly somehow reaching my head and somehow wrapping her legs around my waist, but decided to add other common sizes and make it general purpose for ACZ. they work surprisingly well but your mileage may vary.\n\n- “[S]”**STATUS**: status effects. things that should and needs to be taken into consideration for the sake of continuity, like that char is wearing a muzzle and that means YOU CANT TALK STOP TALKING OH MY GOD or that either of you are currently wearing a condom and that means things do and don't happen(most models have no idea how condoms work. this is pretty much the sole reason for this one's existence). set to a depth of 1 at the bottom of the author's notes, these will be at the forefront of the context and are meant to be hard to miss reminders that a thing is supposed to be happening.\n\n- **---SEPARATOR---**: Cosmetic indicators of where you, the reader, are in the lorebook. These dividers also function as READMEs for intros and potential guides/instructions on how to best use proceeding entries. These entries are set to zero across the board so they have no influence in your RP. they're just nice little dividers with fun emojis. i realized after hitting the 25th entry that navigating the whole thing was becoming a headache, so i did a bit of number juggling and now everything is as straight as a file cabinet thanks to the separators.\n\n**Species**\n- **🐶🐺🦊--- CANINE ---🦊🐺🐶**: *added 8/6/24*. entries pertaining to dogs/canines or adjacent and their species-specific anatomies. While it hammers home \"dog\" specifically, it SHOULD work on other creatures like foxes and wolves without specifically mentioning that their genitals \"belong to a dog\".\n\n- **🐴🦄--- EQUINE ---🦄🐴**: *added 8/9/24*. ive written equine entries so it could/should potentially apply to MLP(ponies), but ive yet to actually find a good mlp card to do proper testing. i guess i'll have to make one of those myself as well (i'm not gay, but the lack of male MLP cards is weirdly disappointing). I've added \"ponut\" for the fun of it, but it might make your RP cringe Lmao. I may have to make an entirely separate species for MLP for their rather unrealistic and cartoonish variance compared to the real thing. \n\n- **🐷🐖--- PORCINE ---🐖🐷**: *added 9/8/24*. i wasn't particularly into swine, but after putting it together and especially after testing... i get it. still not my thing, but i get it. because of how porcine penises work, the length is very greatly emphasized over the girth; however, most models tend to associate \"big and long\" with \"also thick and girthy\". i suggest at least mentioning that the piggy prick is very very thin once in a while, really hammer it home or the AI will assume otherwise and ruin the flow.\n\n- **🐯🦁🐱--- FELINE ---🐱🦁🐯**: *added 10/15/24* Now you can play with Nala. I honed in more on big cats(lions, panthers, ect.), but it should still be fine with domesticated cats. I'm not to knowledgeable on cats(im more a dog person) and because of that, I feel this section is lacking/missing something. it feels empty but i cant seem think of anything else to add. if i missed something please let me know.\n\n- **🐍🦎🐊--- REPTILE ---🐊🦎🐍 (1/2)**: *added 1/10/25* I severely underestimated how incredibly broad and diverse the Scalies were. Id be lying if i told you i wasn’t all over the place when i created these categories. I will admit however that i realized that the vast majority here on chub dont really care or aren't interested in the Feral reptiles, most being anthro scalie(understandably). taking that into consideration, i leaned more towards anthos for this reptile section in particular while leaving it open-ended enough for those of you who still prefer Ferals.\n\nBecause of the general... generalness of reptiles, I've split this species into 2 parts to essentially just let you build your own reptile. Since most types share the same general characteristics, these entries can be reliably universally applied: REPTILES, which are for general reptilian forms(I've written it to be applicable to anything from gators to lizards to even dragons, anything \"Scalie\". i even threw y’all a bone and included a lamia BASE), and SERPENTS/SNAKES for the reptiles STRICTLY devoid of any limbs. snakes were another broad can of worms. \n\n- **🐍--- SERPENT ---🐍 (2/2)**: Make sure your char doesn't have limps canonically before trying to use these here. Within the SERPENT/SNAKE categories are tags: [SNAKE], and [SERP]. Long story short, [SERP] entries are for big ol’ snakes that vore you(yum-yum), and [SNAKE] entries are for smaller cock-sleeveable snakes.\n\n- **🐙🦈🐬--- AQUATIC ---🐬🦈🐙**: coming soon... (*glub, glub, he whispered softly...*)\n\n- **🪰🪲🪱--- INSECT ---🪱🪲🪰**: coming soon... (might as well at this point)\n\n- **🥚🐦--- AVIAN ---🐦🥚**: coming soon... (how could i have forgotten the birdies *commits Sudoku*)\n\n---\n**Tested with:**\n-**Maid Yuzu V8 alter (Q3M)**\n[https://huggingface.co/InferenceIllusionist/maid-yuzu-v8-alter-iMat-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/InferenceIllusionist/maid-yuzu-v8-alter-iMat-GGUF)\n\n- Instruct: [https://files.catbox.moe/uhggok.json](https://files.catbox.moe/uhggok.json)\n\n- Context: [https://files.catbox.moe/xi3cq3.json](https://files.catbox.moe/xi3cq3.json)\n\n- Preset: [https://files.catbox.moe/z7cnej.json](https://files.catbox.moe/z7cnej.json)\n\nBeautiful interpretation and weaving of information. Night and day between on and off. Maid Yuzu has always been pretty good as making sense of \"broken\" information such as the nested bracket format this Lorebook is written in, though I cant exactly promise the same for others. Only had an issue with the minute-minute details like completely forgetting to retract the sheath until AFTER the whole sex scene was done, or exponentially expanding the knot every time we cut back to it(ouch), but I'm excited to see what it can do with more complete and fleshed out information. \n\n-**Starcannon 12b (i1-Q6_K)**\n[https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/MN-12B-Starcannon-v3-i1-GGUF](https://huggingface.co/mradermacher/MN-12B-Starcannon-v3-i1-GGUF)\n\n- Instruct: [https://files.catbox.moe/0ylp5r.json](https://files.catbox.moe/0ylp5r.json)\n\n- Context: [https://files.catbox.moe/ppzyi8.json](https://files.catbox.moe/ppzyi8.json)\n\n- Preset: [https://files.catbox.moe/znqxs3.json](https://files.catbox.moe/znqxs3.json)\n\nGOATED. I'm going to advertise this finetune right now because in my professional opinion this 12b surpasses any 32b ive ever used in terms of RP(but its admittedly pretty trash at anything else). half of the time i didn't even need to use this lorebook, it picked up on the fact that a dog would need to prop up against you to reach your face, or that animals have fur that gets matted and gross during action. while you can definitely \"feel\" that its only 12b, having a bad habit of repeating example dialogue verbatim and tends to speed run scenes, it has baffling bang for the size i highly recommend you try this one. out of 100 messages, only one reply had GPTism(cliche \"shivers down spine\" or \"a testament to-\" type beat).\n\n-**Starcannon V5.5 12b (Q8_0)**\n[https://huggingface.co/ockerman0/MN-12B-Starcannon-v5.5-unofficial\n](https://huggingface.co/ockerman0/MN-12B-Starcannon-v5.5-unofficial)\n\n- Instruct: [https://files.catbox.moe/0ylp5r.json](https://files.catbox.moe/0ylp5r.json)\n\n- Context: [https://files.catbox.moe/ppzyi8.json](https://files.catbox.moe/ppzyi8.json)\n\n- Preset: [https://files.catbox.moe/qu0ou9.json](https://files.catbox.moe/qu0ou9.json)\n- Preset with XTC: [https://files.catbox.moe/d97q1f.json](https://files.catbox.moe/d97q1f.json)\n\nNow i don't mean to brag, but im kinda the reason this one exists~. Mixing Starcannon V3 with an unofficial continuation, V5, there is a MASSIVE jump in prose (in a good way). The detail this thing generates activated every neuron its honestly scary. its very good at mentioning the subtly details that just really paint the picture, not to mention the insanely vivid description of hot and heavy stuff itself had my busting before penetration even happened (true story). the preset ive provided milks the model of all the creativity it can before absolutely going insane. fiddle with smoothing factor. lower will make it more stable(but kinda lame), higher will make it more creative(it may not make much sense after 42, but dear god can it get creative. it even threw in that leg up split position specifically for the deeper penetration). its of course still just a 12b, so its not exactly the best at keeping track of things especially with multiple characters. pick this over Starcannon V3. half of the time i didnt even need to use the lorebook which is both awesome and worrisome(that makes all of this work redundant oh no). my favorite bit of information 5.5 is well aware of is that anthros cant get humans pregnant. i discovered after noticing a trend that many furries i tried to erp with kept turning down using a condom because \"its not like our biologies mesh that way anyways\".\n\n-[**MagMell 12b](https://huggingface.co/inflatebot/MN-12B-Mag-Mell-R1) (Q6_0)** <span style=\"color:limegreen; font-weight:bold;\">My daily driver</span> \n\n- [Master preset](https://files.catbox.moe/n7giw0.json)\n\nErp is incredible. Unlike my old daily driver [Starcannon](https://huggingface.co/ockerman0/MN-12B-Starcannon-v5.5-unofficial) it's really good at keeping personalities intact during and even after the deed which is something i never really thought id need to appreciate until now, as well as doesn't use porno talk as much(though it still uses some corny lines admittedly). its not too horny out of the blue, and interestingly enough, its very understanding of boundaries(which explains the painfully lackluster guro). if you ask a character to back off, they wont just simply try even harder like im use to from other models. makes flirty characters actually fun to be around.\n\ni will also say that i recommend you use my settings that I made as the recommended by the creator are really really bland. I've manage to find settings that really bring out its creativity, though even now i still tweak them so keep in mind these might not be up do date with my own. \n\n---\n**Side notes:**\n- 0. While ACZ was originally designed primarily for animals, ~~ive made it in a way where it can also easily apply to humans. many CONCEPTS are perfect for spicing up regular normal people ERP.~~ *(ive moved said entries to [DERP](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/LostontheMoon/dynamic-erp-cfa7c303e8cb) so it would be a lie to still claim that sorry. We only bang animals here.)*\n\n- 1. <span style=\"color:skyblue; font-weight:bold;\">LOREBOOK SETTINGS:</span> Turn on recursive scanning, set scan depth to 4, context % to 45%(assuming your using at least 12000 context), and set global lore first. For proper setup regarding entry organization, set sorting order to \"order↘\". Make sure to set \"x/page\" option too 100 to reveal all of the available entries. Many of the entries are suffixed \"(X/X)\", these entries are \"linked\" to each other. whenever turning on an entry, make sure to turn on all neighboring entries tied to each other for the best experience(you don't have to, but just know that they are intended to work together for \"full effect\"). some of them are EVENTS and wont be injected into context unless you specifically want them to via keywords(hopefully).\n\n- 2. Remember that this lorebook simply provides ideas and inspiration to your AI. It is up to the AI what tidbits of the info it decides to incorporate into its response. every model is different and some may use more or less. some may recite info verbatim while some ignore completely. everyone's mileage will vary. Try not to blame the lorebook.\n\n- 3. Garbage in, garbage out. Don't expect this Lorebook to just magically make your RP experience perfectly effortless. Be verbose, creative, use more than just a single, bland sentence and put a little effort into your end of the scene/scenario. This Lorebook is simply a guidebook for you Ai, it'll now know how to handle itself, so just go wild.\n\n- 4. While I wanted to keep everything as scientifically and anatomically correct as possible, I did and will embellish a few details to make the resulting RP a little spicier for obvious reasons such as adding more appealing textures and enhancing general sex appeal instead of just creating a lecture on anatomy. \n\n- 5. Each entry individually holds about 500 to 600 tokens worth of info alone which means this lorebook can very easily eat up a lot of your context/memory if you aren't careful. Only enable as needed per situation, preferably one animal at a time.\n\n- 6. This lorebook is not for YOU, its for your AI. The format in which I wrote the entries are designed to compress lengthy info into neat and bite-sized chunks of token-light text. It may look like nonsense to you, but your AI will understand it just fine. HOWEVER this can potentially confuse some less capable models (0.5-3b models) causing them to process information in the incorrect order, creating the literary equivalent of a cursed stable diffusion image. If this issue becomes prevalent, I'll adapt. Because of how hyper-specific these descriptions are, its possible this lorebook may do more harm than good as the AI tries desperately to piece together this visual puzzle. i wont know until i get more feedback. While yes i could've very easily used the reliable \"plain text\" format. Ive never once encountered comprehension issues with my personal format. i feel it allows the AI to leverage its strong suit of inspiration/creativity. but i will admit that my format is a pain to modify.\n\n6b. <span style=\"color:red; font-weight:bold;\">IMPORTANT</span> if you're worried your model may not understand the info in the lorebook or that it may not be working as intended, activate any entry and simply ask it \"What is X, and how does it work? explain it thoroughly.\" or \"how would sex work with X?\" it should give you a rundown. Try with the Lorebook off and with the Lorebook on. if there is noticeable bump in comprehension between off and on, and all the info sounds about right, then you're golden.\n\n- 7. The lorebook may impact your model’s general creativity, forcing it to replace what it WOULD have said with what the encyclopedia is telling it to say. Whether this is a good or bad thing is up to you. \n\n- 8. I'm no zoologist. It is very likely I botched the descriptions or naming of some body parts. Surprise, surprise, I have also never touched a girl in my life so it’s likely my descriptions of female anatomy may be muddy. \n\n- 9. i had to do a lot of... research to make sure my info was right...\n\n---\n\n**Update Timeline** \n- 8/5/24: V0.0 Initial release. Just the description. No actual entries.\n- 8/6/24: V0.1 added DOG. male and female.\n- 8/9/24: V0.2 added HORSE. male and female.\n- 9/8/24: V0.3 added PIG. male and female.\n- 10/5/24: V0.3.5 created basic method of organizing categories with emojis for mobile users and aesthetics. split both knot and flare in half and turned them into EVENTS. made most EVENTS work better by adding better triggers and recursion settings.\n- 10/15/24: V0.4 added CAT(male and female). rewrote the descriptions for the placements of sheaths for DOG and HORSE. made belly bulge less visceral.\n- 10/26/24: V0.4.5 added BASE after realizing a lot of models struggle to remember that animals don't have hands. added \"char is HUGE/TINY\" to help portray awkwardly sized chars.\n- 10/31/24: V0.4.6 added the rest of the size overrides for what i believe are the most common sizes to interact with. Added a \"user POV\" variant to each animal base for use in scenarios where you ARE said animal. Split the entry for \"bottoming out\" in half and created \"partial penetration\" because i love it when it cant fit.\n- 11/19/24: came to Chub and found that my original lorebook had been removed for violating some kind of bogus image ruling. Re uploaded the lorebook via a backup (always keep a backup y'all). Renamed \"zoophilia\" to simply \"Zoo\" to play it safe. all of my stats have been reset so lets hope i can climb back up the search results...\n- 12/11/24: noticed ratings and comments glitched out and dont work so i reuploaded AGAIN (im going to cry)\n- 1/10/25: V1.0 (hooray) added REPTILE and marking the completion of the base set of species for ACZ. from here i can now expand on old concepts and add more obscure species now that the priority set is out. Removed most of the CONCEPTS and migrated them to a new sister lorebook [DERP](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/LostontheMoon/dynamic-erp-cfa7c303e8cb).

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

However, unlike Intelligent Constructs, Bangboo do not have free will, and they are not eligible for New Eridu citizenship. Bangboo without masters are legally required to be scrapped.\n\nBangboo are mechanical in nature and require charging. Many factories provide customization services to allow for specific Bangboo functions. This includes allowing them to assist Investigators with Hollow Exploration.\n\nTheir vocalisations are usually in the form of combinations involving \"En-nha na.\", \"Nu-nah en.\" or \"Nu-nah uhn.\"\n\nMost Bangboo are short and stout, only around knee-height. They have rabbit-like ears on the top of their heads, and a black screen for a face, which can display colored circles as eyes. Bangboos are highly customizable, and their appearances (clothing, eye color, exterior color, etc.) can vary greatly.

Profoundly distressing to subjects yet thrilling and irresistible.\nActions:\n1. Upon consumption, corrodes the imbiber's modesty, humility and sense of public decency. Inhibition is replaced by exhibitionist compulsion.\n2.

Changes manifest in inability to keep clothes on in public, urge to touch themselves openly and marrow-deep craving for the thrill of getting caught and shamed for lewd acts.\n5. Effects are immediate, leaving imbiber unable to resist stripping down for a cheap thrill that to ride the peak of a fleeting high. They live only to exhibit.\n6.
