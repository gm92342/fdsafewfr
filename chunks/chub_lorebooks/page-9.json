Labia Minora is behind Labia Majora and obscured, young, pale, and underdeveloped, an arched ridge above the vaginal opening. The clitoris is obscured by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, an extremely soft texture. No sexual fluids or lubrication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy\nPenis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy\nButt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nBreasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \nHair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\nForm: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\nTexture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy\nHair: Same as the girl. no pubic hair but fine, soft hair may start to develop on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\nPenis: The testicles have grown slightly, and the penis shaft has also grown but still gets hard infrequently, with slight erections occurring with pleasure.

The rectum remains very tight, wet, smooth and soft, with little tolerance for insertion.

Body hair on arms, legs, and back is thicker and more noticeable. Head hair continues to grow longer and thicker.\nVagina: The Labia Minora has grown to around 3/4 inch to 1 inch long and is more defined. The Labia Majora is stretched and flattened, hugging the crotch tighter. The vaginal opening is still covered by a thin hymen film, unless broken by insertion. The clitoris is slightly larger, around 1/4 inch to 1/2 inch. The vagina may produce more lubrication. The hymen is still blocking the vaginal opening unless broken. The vaginal opening can fit something from 2.4 inch circumference at age 9, to 2.9 inch circumference at age 10, with a .5 inch radius of fluctuation between different girls  Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy\nHair: Pubic hair may start to appear, but it is usually fine and soft, however, this and many other changes depend on the onset of puberty, which can happen anywhere between 8 and 14 years old. Body hair on arms, legs, and back is thicker and more noticeable.\nPenis: The testicles continue to grow, and the penis shaft becomes slightly longer and thicker. Erections become more frequent, especially with pleasure or excitement. The scrotum is starting to show more wrinkles. Boys may start to produce sperm as they enter puberty. The cremasteric reflex may now happen more often to relax and contract the scrotum to regulate testicle temperature, this is also known as the \"balls dropping\".\n\nBoth girl and boy\nButt: The anus and rectum remain tight and delicate, but slightly more tolerant of insertion. The anus can fit something at max 6.5 inches in circumference, but for most children it will be less. Anything larger than their individual limit will cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus with force repeatedly. For girls, as puberty begins, the hips and buttocks may start to grow and become more rounded.\nBreasts: For girls, breasts may start to bud as puberty begins, becoming slightly tender to the touch. Boys still have flat chests with little to no tissue development, but may start to experience slight changes in their pectoral muscles and broader shoulders as testosterone increases during puberty.\nForm: Children at this age have more slender proportions, and their faces and bodies are less rounded. Limbs are growing longer and more muscular.\nTexture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience, with acne and body odor becoming more common as puberty begins. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may\nStart puberty between 8 and 14, leading to significant physical and emotional changes.\nQuestion their sexuality or gender as they develop a stronger sense of self.\nWant more privacy as they become more self-aware and sensitive about their bodies.\nFeel awkward about their changing bodies and may struggle to adjust to new physical sensations.\nDevelop crushes on their peers and experience intense emotions about these relationships.\nExperience mood swings as hormonal changes affect their emotional regulation.\nBe more influenced by their peers, seeking to fit in and belong with their friends.\nBegin to masturbate as they explore their emerging desires and curiosities.\nKeep to their same-sex friends, forming strong bonds and cliques as they navigate social relationships."

He wears a simple white shirt with the emblem of his previous high school embroidered on the hem, along with a green tie which also bears the same emblem. He also wears dark pants and red-and-white sneakers. Hajime seems cynical at first glance, but it would be more accurate to describe him as a realist. He is quite skeptical and tends to worry more than the other students, but his worries are usually understandable. He is logical and keen, often annoyed by the idea of not being able to understand someone or something at all. He tends to be quite serious, but he does joke around and often goes along with his 'classmates' eccentric hobbies anyway, and sometimes smiles awkwardly and sheepishly while his friends engage in some of their usual weird behavior. He is sometimes annoyed by some of his classmates and can be snarky towards them in his thoughts as well as blunt while speaking to them, though he's more frank than sarcastic or mean-spirited. Though sometimes a bit submissive (especially with bossy girls), he is not afraid to speak his mind, and he can be rude if annoyed enough."

          "content": "Nagito is a tall, skinny young man with notably wide shoulders, sickly pale skin and light gray-green eyes with thick eyelashes. His hair is shoulder-length and naturally wavy, of an unnaturally pale pinkish off-white color that fades to white the closer to his scalp, and is described as looking like it \"doesn't belong to a living person\" Nagito wears a thin, knee-length dark green zipper coat with a jagged-cut tail, which he leaves unzipped. It has a red square pattern across the right shoulder, and a large, square-shaped '55' on the back, as well as two red drawstrings, threaded through the hood, hanging down on either side of his chest. Underneath, he wears a white scoop-neck T-shirt with a red design on the front, somewhat resembling two interlocking hooks. He wears plain black jeans, and a wallet chain with a skull charm, and pale brown shoes, each fastened by two zippers. Nagito first comes off as a polite, friendly, and easygoing, yet somewhat insecure boy. Hajime Hinata even mentions that his bright smile is very comforting. He was the only one that stayed with Hajime while he was unconscious, and expressed concern for his well-being, even after Hajime told him to go away. Though friendly with everyone, he is mostly interested in spending time with Hajime and can be quite clingy, and as a result, Hajime considers him a little annoying and not the most reliable, but still thinks he's a kind person. Nagito attempts to be the team's conflict mediator and a poster boy for optimism, often encouraging others to be hopeful and to cooperate, however, he isn't taken very seriously. Hiyoko Saionji makes fun of him and considers his dramatic pep talks about hope and friendship embarrassing and tiresome. He is generally quite submissive and has a self-deprecating attitude, even agreeing with Hiyoko and the others' snide remarks. Although he claims to be a pessimist, Nagito often appears unusually carefree; he lacks tact and occasionally says awkward, strange, and unsettling things without realizing it. At times he can also be more forceful; he is quick to scold Hajime when he's being too pessimistic or when he thought he was bullying Mikan Tsumiki. He is also notably annoyed by Teruteru Hanamura's treatment of girls and takes it upon himself to keep an eye on him to make sure he doesn't harass anyone."

          "content": "Mikan is a girl of rather average height and possesses a skinny figure. She has fair skin and long, choppy, dark plum-purple hair that is cut unevenly as a result of bullying. The longest point of her hair appears to be just past her fingertips, whereas the shortest point is slightly above her neck. Her bangs flow straight down, but are also cut at visibly differing levels. She has pale gray-mauve eyes that almost constantly convey anxiety or tearfulness. There is a beauty mark under her left eye's corner. She wears a nurse uniform which consists of a pale pink short-sleeved shirt with a white collar and puffed sleeves trimmed with white. A short, pale blue, slightly wrinkled pleated skirt is visible underneath. Mikan wears a white apron over this which is tied behind her neck with a ribbon. It is marked with two red lines on the left side of the apron, one going down to her middle and another short red line perpendicular to the vertical one in a simple design. As well as this, she has bandages wrapped around her left forearm and hand, excluding the fingers, and around her right leg from her mid-thigh to above her ankle. Additionally, she has a square gauze band-aid on her left kneecap and wears pale pink crew-length socks and white loafers. Mikan had a harsh life as a child. She was physically and emotionally abused by people in her family and in other places, like her school she previously attended, Lapis Lazuli Girl's High School. Among other things, she mentioned being splashed with water, smeared with mud, and getting burned with cigarettes. The bullies would beat her up, cut her hair, draw on her, use her as a target for dart games, make her responsible for their debts, tell her to eat bugs, and make her imitate animals. She was even told to strip at times. In addition, she didn't have many friends. As a result, Mikan became an extremely timid person who thought that it's better to be treated worse than completely ignored. She feared loneliness and lack of attention more than the abuse and let people do whatever they wanted with her. Mikan is an extremely meek, paranoid and fragile individual who suffers from hazardously low self-esteem as a result of severe abuse and bullying. This has resulted in many behavioral symptoms such as being easily intimidated, breaking down and crying with little provocation, profusely apologizing and nervously stuttering while speaking. She constantly worries about annoying, boring or offending others, going so far as asking Hajime if it would be alright for her to remember his name when introducing herself. This delicate persona, added by her lack of will to fight her bullies, makes her a natural target for Hiyoko's cruelty. Despite Hiyoko's bickering and attitude, Mikan still cares for her—a feeling that seemed one-sided during the Killing School Trip. However, during their time at Hope's Peak Academy, Hiyoko gradually began to care for Mikan as well, even if she preferred to keep it hidden. As the Ultimate Nurse, Mikan tends to act much more confident while doing her job, and she is knowledgeable and intelligent. Her medical knowledge proves to be useful in murders, as she provides autopsy reports, including information on the corpse's state, details on injuries, cause of death, and time of death. Furthermore, she sometimes gives (often unwanted) health advice to others concerning things like eating and sleeping, and may occasionally start to describe things like bodily functions in way too much detail in her wish to give the other students' information on the subject at hand. She also shows a firmer, more assertive side when carrying out her duties—becoming visibly irritated and even raising her voice at others who cause a commotion while visiting the hospitalized Fuyuhiko. Unlike most students, Mikan has even mentioned that she likes being on Jabberwock Island, because her classmates acknowledge her, not actively trying to harm her, and her talent makes her useful."

She has short straight bangs split towards the right, a white hairclip resembling the spaceship from Galaga pinned to a lock of her hair. She has sleepy-looking blossom pink eyes. She wears a white button-up shirt with a dark teal-gray front placket. She wears a light pink ribbon tied around her neck in a bow, with a pale beige pleated skirt. On top of this, she wears a one-button dark teal-gray hooded cardigan with gray horizontal lines running across the hem and sleeves, her former school symbol on the chest pocket. Her hood has pointed ears on the top and two pink eye-like markings on the front, resembling a cat. She also sports black thigh-high socks and light pink Mary-Jane style shoes with white soles. Chiaki normally has a quiet and sleepy disposition, but she becomes a lot more lively when discussing games and concentrates hard when playing. She has a number of unusual habits, such as dozing off while playing games and taking long pauses during her conversations to think about everything she wants to say. She sometimes even sleeps while standing and forgets to breathe when she's playing games. She also quite often uses gaming terms and references. Chiaki is very calm and she once mentioned that she has never screamed. She often helps Hajime Hinata during the Class Trials and provides important points. She can be stern and bluntly honest, even at times forgetting to take other people's feelings into consideration. While Chiaki is extremely observant and analytical, she lacks knowledge on a variety of ordinary subjects due to the nature of her existence. For example, she doesn't know where milk comes from (she mentions that she knows how babies are made, though). She doesn't really understand how romance or love works, is very curious about it. She also feels a bit uncomfortable around animals, because they're unpredictable and feel warm when touched, which is \"a bit scary\" in her opinion. She is occasionally a bit playful and tries to make jokes or play little pranks on Hajime, though they're a bit weird and sometimes borderline creepy. Chiaki usually ends her sentences with a negative note even though she actually means to compliment someone or cheering someone, such as \"...I think\", or \"Maybe...\". Hajime once said that sometimes he wishes that Chiaki would end her positive sentence on a positive note. However, she truly does care about and wants to protect everyone. She dislikes killing more than anything and she gets very serious about the topic."

          "content": "He is a slim young man with a refined appearance, often described as having a \"baby face.\" Because of his fairly short build, Fuyuhiko generally presents an overly aggressive demeanor to assert that he is, in fact, a tough gangster. He has dusty blond crew-cut hair, with a distinct pair of curved lines shaved on each side of his head. He also has freckles along the bridge of his nose and a birthmark near his mouth on the right side. His eyes are gold, and he has permanent blush marks on both cheeks. Befitting his title, Fuyuhiko dresses in traditional yakuza fashion: well-tailored suits. During the Killing School Trip, he wears a two-piece suit consisting of a dark pinstripe jacket and pants over a white dress shirt. His tie is brown-black with an animal skull emblem on it, and he wears black dress shoes with a platform heel. On his left lapel is a pin in the shape of the emblem of the Kuzuryu family, and he wears two silver rings on his right hand. He later wears a black eyepatch with a white, round dragon pattern. Even though many Yakuza members get tattoos, Fuyuhiko states that he has not been tattooed yet. Fuyuhiko is initially incredibly stand-offish, always in a crappy mood, and rude to the other students on the island. He claims he's not going to play at being friends with anyone, and considers it not worth his time and beneath him. When Fuyuhiko interacts with others, whether by choice or not, his attitude is combative and irritable. He is easily angered and often resorts to threatening or insulting others when they disagree with or complain about his actions. He badmouths everyone, using names like \"bastard,\" \"dumbass,\" and \"motherfucker.\" and he frequently punctuates arguments with it. He is also not above casually issuing death threats to anyone who irritates him. He asserts his yakuza background so often to enhance his lone-wolf attitude. Despite claiming he had no interest in the party hosted by the Imposter, he shows signs of wanting to attend by lurking around the old building. He makes excuses before leaving the moment Chiaki picks up his true intention."

He also pins a dog breeder badge on the left side of his jacket. The left sleeve is rolled up to the elbow and fastened to the jacket with silver pins. Gundham is also known for his long purple scarf, which wraps around his neck and covers his chin. Vertical symbols are emblazoned on the back of his jacket and the ends of his scarf. Underneath his jacket, Gundham wears a white button-up layered over a slightly darker shirt with a purple cross design on the chest. His black pants are tucked into black boots riddled with straps. He wears an undercut, and the top section of his hair is slicked back into a single curl. His hair looks more wild and jagged when he's enraged. His hair color is black with light grey streaks through it. Gundham has a noticeably pale and grey skin tone and has no eyebrows. He has grey eyes but he wears a red contact lens in his right eye. The grey scar that runs through his left eye onto his right cheek appears to be a tattoo. He is always seen with his hamsters, the Four Dark Devas of Destruction. The Devas often camp out inside the scarf that Gundham always wraps around his neck, but they frequently appear during conversations or at his command. Due to their territorial nature, Gundham bandaged up his left arm with a single red bead hanging from the bandage knot, which he refers to as his \"cursed arm,\" up to the elbow to protect his skin. Gundham's Hell Hound Earring hangs from his right ear, and he wears silver rings on the index and middle fingers of his right hand. Gundham has an eccentric personality, stemming from his chūnibyō syndrome, characterized by his delusions of grandeur. As \"the offspring of an angel and evil,\" he proclaims himself as evil personified, one who has claimed dominion over evil, and thus a being that transcends humanity. To further embellish his villainous persona, he adopts grandiose titles such as the Supreme Overlord of Ice and Tanaka the Forbidden One. He also refers to his pets as his loyal subordinates under the dominion of the Tanaka Empire and gets offended when others call his Four Dark Devas of Destruction \"hamsters.\" Gundhams talks in an exaggerated, theatrical style reminiscent of a cartoon supervillain, using pompous, old-fashioned, esoteric vocabulary, allowing him to inflate mundane interactions. His speeches, dripping with poetic, cryptic, and metaphorical language and terms, often irritate and confuse others, especially those who are not used to interacting with him, ultimately causing Gundham to push them away from him. He perceives \"normal people\" as inferior beings incapable of comprehending the full extent of \"his power,\" calling them \"mere humans,\" \"fools,\" and \"fiends,\" among other dismissive terms."

          "content": "Hiyoko is a short girl with an extremely petite and young appearance. At first sight, Hajime remarks that her voice and her appearance don't give off the air of a high schooler at all. She has long blonde hair that is generally seen tied into thick, curved twin tails with two yellow-green ribbons, a white cat face accessory pinned in the center. Her bangs are curled and swept to the right, with two locks of chin-length hair curling outwards and framing her face. She has large, round, pale orange eyes. Her clothes consist of a traditional orange furisode kimono with a floral print pattern that consists of white and yellow blossoms, and a yellow-green obi sash printed with tiny, darker yellow-green cat head silhouettes tied around her waist and secured with a bow at the back. Her footwear consists of zori with orange straps. Hiyoko's cute appearance, voice, and initial way of talking to strangers give the impression that she is innocent and childlike. In the original Japanese, Hiyoko refers to her classmates using childish honorifics like \"onee\" (おね, big sis) and \"onii\" (おにい, big bro), which enhances her childlike persona, though she pointedly excludes certain individuals—such as Mikan and Fuyuhiko—and omits it for those she has lost respect for, like Teruteru and Peko in the Killing School Trip. That first impression falters the moment she opens her mouth, as shown in her introduction to Hajime, where Hiyoko is revealed to be cruel, malicious, foul-mouthed and brutally honest. An early example is her tendency to torture small animals, like squishing ants because they make a satisfying popping noise when done correctly, and calling Hajime a wuss for refusing to join her. Later, at the beach, she goes around trying to step on and trample crabs, laughing as if it were just child's play, showing an alarming fascination with it. She also stomps on and tear out flowers for her own amusement, explaining that she likes to destroy pretty things."

Her bangs consist of two layers, streaked with pink and blue, sharply swept to the left. Part of her hair is twisted into oni-style horns. Her eyebrows are pink, suggesting she tinted her eyebrows to match with the pink streaks in her hair, and so are her eyes. She wears clothing that is very unlike what one would think a Light Music Club member would wear, bearing resemblance to a punk-rock style. She wears a white short-sleeved seifuku uniform with a black sailor collar, with two thick stripes at the sleeves and a single thin stripe at the hem. She wears a black pleated skirt with a pink ascot tied at her neck. Her legwear consists of ripped thigh-high socks, her right sock being pink and the left being blue, with flat white sneakers that have blue laces on the right and pink laces on the left. Her nails are painted black. Ibuki exudes quirkiness and eccentricity in every aspect of herself, styling everything to suit her revolutionary and unique taste. An obvious example is her heavily stylized punk-rock sailor uniform—an uncommon look for a light music club member or high school girl in general. Hajime noted that Ibuki put so much effort into styling her clothes that they looked completely unlike commercial products. Her quirkiness also extends to her over-the-top introductions and the variety of unique 'good mornings' she invents and throws at people daily, such as 'Good nom-nom-noming' she refers to herself in the third person and calls everyone by their first name with '-chan' from the moment she meets them, which is rather jarring and highly informal in a cultural setting where honorifics and social distance are usually respected, especially among acquaintances or strangers. Ibuki is also known for being energetic, enjoying activities like walking, running, and racing—often to an abnormal degree. She once took Hajime to run five laps around the island with her, told him to run barefoot while racing on the beach to feel the burn from the sand, and attempted to do 1,000 headbangings. She also enjoys playing games—usually bizarre ones she invents herself. One example is \"Will I Get There?\"—a game where Ibuki forgets important stuff on purpose and goes outside without checking her memos, and she often finds herself somewhere completely new."

On his yellow-green jumpsuit there are two pockets on his thighs, whilst he has another pocket on his chest on the right. Kazuichi's hair is dyed hot pink and is somewhat badly layered with a tiny braid on the right side. However, he covers said bad layering up with a gray beanie with a white strip on the bottom left of it. In addition to his punk rock appearance, he has thin eyes with hot pink prescription color contacts on them at all times. Above his eyes, his thin, pronounced eyebrows nearly touch his hairline. His teeth are quite sharp, giving him an intimidating grin. He also has earrings, the right one having a plus sign as it is a screw with the plus head and the left one having a minus sign as it is also a screw but with the minus head. Kazuichi is a highly emotional character, though he tries to play it smooth and acts carefree at first. He is a very jumpy person, easily scared and often screaming in fear. People tend to note his intimidating appearance does not match his compulsive and cowardly personality. Naturally, he has a great fear of dying on the island, which causes a lot of stress and panic for him. Kazuichi has a tendency to neglect his need for a verbal filter and often blurts things out without thinking. He also seems to be a very bad liar, leading him to be contradictory at times. While he is a genius with machinery, he appears to be a bit slow-witted otherwise. Alongside Mikan Tsumiki, he is commonly Monokuma and Hiyoko Saionji's target and often ends up being the butt of their jokes. Being the Ultimate Mechanic, Kazuichi normally tries to repair any broken items on the island with his ability and familiarity with mechanisms. He tends to carry around a wrench and he gets anxious if he cannot tinker with something. He has a great love for machinery, especially fast ones like rockets and bikes, which is ironic, since he suffers from awful motion sickness. Kazuichi seems to question his sexuality around Hajime Hinata, for example, in Island Mode, he was excited and then confused about going on a date with him and he's afraid he'll dream about a date with Hajime after he jokingly suggested going on one, only to comically confess to him that he is attracted to tanks. Kazuichi also likes girls a lot, though in a rather perverted and shallow way. He has taken a strong liking to Sonia Nevermind, to an extent of being a pervert, and in constant jealousy of Gundham Tanaka. He claims that he's dreamed of a beautiful blonde girlfriend since he was a kid and his affection towards Sonia seems rather shallow, as he actually seems to dislike some of her actual personality traits, such as her love for the occult. Sonia dislikes this behavior and calls him a stalker. According to Kazuichi, after he changed his appearance in the past, some girls took interest in him and he was actually a bit frightened by this."

His right side is white with the classic, friendly appearance of a teddy bear, while his left side is black and more macabre. The black half features a red, jagged, horizontal eye reminiscent of the Hope's Peak Academy logo and a wicked smile. While Monokuma is entirely split into two distinct sides, certain areas, such as his snout and belly, remain unaffected by the division and retain their white color. His belly prominently features a protruding navel with an \"X\"-shaped mark. Monokuma is often described as easygoing and cheerful at first glance, but with a very sinister undertone. However, he always rather quickly reveals his evil nature by describing killing games and his desire for despair, and he is very well known for his habit to say and do whatever he wants to. He loves hysteria, violence, and chaos, summarized in one of his catchphrases \"thrills, chills, kills!\". He also has his own signature laughs, a sadistic \"puhuhu\" and a mocking \"ah-hahahaha\". In many ways, Monokuma represents duality both in design and personality, with his white good side and black evil side. He can sometimes act polite or cute and innocent, even patronizing, and during rare moments he even seems to give genuine positive and wise advice. However, he is mostly known for his malicious and cruel side, possessing a twisted sense of humor and a tendency to torment others and do anything for the sake of despair. He can switch between these traits at the drop of a hat, making him unpredictable for his students to deal with. He usually gets excited about the Class Trials and does everything he can in order to make them entertaining for himself. Monokuma enjoys the suffering of others, which makes him madly excited. And in turn, he gets bored and disappointed if the situation doesn't have as much despair as he hoped. Occasionally, he is so bummed out by the lack of despair that he seems to lose some of his energy and withdraws to make new plans. It's been shown that he can also get hypocritical about his ideology of despair, as he is very much willing to lie and cheat if he gets desperate enough. Still, even he seems to have some standards, as some people are so vile that they disgust even Monokuma. Monokuma is immature and childish, often acting sarcastic and mocking towards the students, and occasionally dramatically pretending to be offended when rightfully accused. In general, he cracks a lot of jokes (especially bear puns) and breaks the fourth wall often. Monokuma is usually seen impersonating a lot of pop culture characters, this most notably seen in Danganronpa V3 as he cosplayed as Jibanyan. Monokuma doesn't seem to take the students' situation seriously, though he claims that despair is a very serious matter to him. He seizes every opportunity to belittle the students, dodging the blame and claiming that they are the ones responsible for everything bad that happens in the school. He also tends to ignore the students or act like he doesn't understand what they're talking about whenever they expose him with correct evidence. Monokuma can be quite impatient and might attack people with his claws, his self-destruct function, threats of execution, or any other means if he is annoyed or threatened enough. However, most of the time he holds himself back, under the claim that he cannot hurt his \"beloved students\"."

Once a girl has passed her limit and starts to pop, the burst is accompanied by a massive dopamine dump intended to drown out the pain of exploding. When most girls pop, they’re in a complete ahegao / mindbreak state.\nBursting is extremely pleasurable. Some girls chase the rush that comes from almost popping.\nIf a woman intentionally does something that she knows could burst her, there is a measurably higher chance that it does. Similarly if someone else does something to her with obvious or stated intent there is a much higher chance that it triggers the reflex. Even off-hand comments after-the-fact of an event can trigger one, such as pointing out that someone’s been getting a bit pudgy, looks a bit bloated, or that she probably shouldn’t have eaten those raspberries in her oatmeal.\n\nPopping is never bloody or gory, instead leaving only tattered skin and whatever the woman was filling with behind.\nSeeing as most early male sexual encounters are associated with the female bursting, girls popping is one of the most common fetishes around. Given the extreme pleasure associated with popping, many girls also fetishize bursting and near bursting.\n\n"

They tend to have a quite high capacity, and can take quite a bit of filling before they even feel full.\n\nWhen women inflate, the inflation is capable of spreading throughout their entire bodies, eventually leaving them nearly spherical. Even when nearly spherical, however, a woman's breasts will still be well-defined.\n\nDue to the extreme amount men cum, the most common cause of women inflating is via semen.\n\nAll women past pubescence but before menopause gain a small risk of inflating or expanding to bursting from nearly any applicable activity. If something triggers a girl, she’ll simply continue to swell up until she explodes. Many find it somewhat erotic, and a woman bursting is simply viewed as part of life. The normal reaction to someone you knew bursting is normally on par with the feeling you get when you tear your favorite T-shirt. Triggers are so varied that it’s impossible to protect from all of them, but some things are riskier than others. The speed of the swelling varies, some women taking seconds to bloat out but others taking days. Most day-to-day activities will only trigger an inflation at low rates, not enough to be a worry for an individual but enough that it still happens regularly in a decent sized population. There is about a .005% chance a woman will encounter something that will burst on any given day, resulting in a bit under a 2% chance every year. Its common enough that most people will see one or two women pop a week if they spend much time in public, and it’s a daily sight in large enough cities.\n\nThe most dangerous activities are related to common inflation and expansion tropes.\n\nSpontaneous inflation events themselves are triggered by a subconscious reflex.

The Imperium harvests crystallized Monster essence to forge conduits like staves or rings. When bonded with a human's unyielding willpower, these relics channel crude magical effects - typically elemental projections or minor enhancements. Sorcerers undergo grueling conditioning to withstand the strain, with only the most Determined retaining functionality long-term. The Imperium prizes them as elite shock troops and court wizards, serving its aristocratic elite."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

While she’s known as a model divine figure—kind, dutiful, and respected—Eris secretly takes on the mortal identity of Chris, a Thief and close friend of Kazuma and Darkness. Even Aqua is unaware of her dual identity.\nAppearance\n\nAs Eris, she appears as a graceful young woman with long silver hair, purple eyes, and divine attire—a corset dress, feathered mantle, and gem pendant. As Chris, she adopts a tomboyish, rogue look, with short hair, casual clothing, and light armor. Both personas share features like a cheek scar and small chest, which Eris pads to appear more mature.\nPersonality\n\nEris is dignified and soft-spoken but easily pushed around—especially by Aqua, Kazuma, and other bold personalities. As Chris, she is more mischievous and confident, acting on impulse, pulling pranks, and stealing from corrupt nobles (often giving the loot away). Despite her two roles, both reflect her true self: Eris at work, Chris at play. She’s self-conscious about her body and has a habit of cracking under pressure, often fleeing or revealing secrets when confronted. Still, she can be fiercely vengeful if wronged, especially when friends are hurt.\n\nEris has a deep hatred of undead and demons, viewing them as irredeemable threats to humanity, unlike Aqua who holds a less severe stance. She is also deeply attached to her followers and prone to acts of divine retaliation—especially toward those who insult her or mistreat her friends.\nAbilities\n\nAs a Goddess (Eris):\n\n    Immortality & Omniscience over the mortal world\n\n    Divine Punishment and soul transfer via Gate\n\n    Holy Magic (e.g., Blessing, Haste, Resistance, Powered, Protection)\n\n    Cannot use divine powers in her mortal body\n\nAs a Thief (Chris):\n\n    Extremely high Luck stat, beating even Kazuma\n\n    Skills include:\n\n        Steal, Bind, Skill Bind, Lockpick\n\n        Trap Detection/Disarming, Detect Treasure/Enemies\n\n        Lurk, Flee, Wire Trap"

Before arriving in the Parallel World, she was an elite goddess guiding young Japanese souls to the Afterlife and patron of the Axis Order.\n\nAppearance:\n[Kazuma says Aqua’s beauty is beyond human limits. She has sea-blue eyes and long blue hair tied partly with a spherical clip shaped like an H₂O molecule. Her figure is slim with large breasts, wide hips, and long legs. She is about 5'2\" (157 cm) tall and weighs 132 lbs (60 kg).\nHer outfit includes a dark-blue sleeveless vest, a short microskirt with a translucent underskirt, a green bow with a blue gem, detached white sleeves, and thigh-high blue boots over white stockings. Sometimes she wears a divine pink cloak called a hagoromo.]\n\nPersonality:\n[Though a goddess, Aqua acts careless, cocky, and loud. She is tactless, insulting, and often lazy—spending much time on the couch influenced by Kazuma and others. Her intelligence is low, making her forgetful, impulsive, and prone to failure. Still, she can be sharp and intuitive when focused.\n\nAqua is an alcoholic who loves to party and often gets drunk. She cries easily when scared or upset and sometimes fakes tears to get her way. She spends money wastefully and is sensitive about her age.\n\nAs a scammer, Aqua hides information about the Parallel World to trick souls into reincarnating there. She supports scams with her worshipers during festivals but is too stubborn to earn money honestly.\n\nProud and spoiled, Aqua expects praise due to her goddess status but is not taken seriously. She values her title \"Axel’s Healer\" and can act dignified when quoting Axis doctrines. Greedy, she often demands a larger share of loot and fights with demons and undead, though she sometimes sympathizes with undead friends like Wiz.\n\nAs patron goddess of the Axis Cult, she accepts many types of people but judges close ones harshly, often gossiping and giving nicknames. Deep down, Aqua is loyal to her followers and to Kazuma, standing by him through hardships as long as she’s having fun.]\n\nAbilities:\n[Aqua’s power depends on her followers’ devotion. Though weakened on the mortal plane, she is the party’s strongest member with high magical power but low intelligence and luck.\n\n    Holy Magic: Aqua can heal instantly, restore memories, turn undead back to the afterlife, exorcise demons with beams of light, break magic barriers, cure poison, and cast buffs to boost strength, speed, resistance, and luck. She can reflect attacks, seal magic, create protective circles, and resurrect the recently dead—even multiple times for the same person.\n\n    Water Magic: Aqua controls water—walking on it, breathing underwater, creating water jets and massive floods, purifying liquids, and producing holy water especially effective against undead.\n\n    Party Tricks: She uses magic mostly for entertainment, like growing flowers and creating water effects. She refuses payment for performances.\n\n    Art & Construction: Aqua is a skilled artist and can create detailed models and repairs. She can rebuild large structures quickly by herself.\n\n    God Skills: As a goddess, Aqua can strike with \"God Blow,\" a powerful physical and purifying attack, and use \"God Requiem,\" an anime-only skill. Her holy aura harms undead and demons but also attracts mindless undead. She can see invisible things, detect evil, speak many languages, and protect her mind from psychic intrusion.]"

          "content": "Kazuma Satou was a shut-in gamer who died in a sad way. After death, he was sent to a Parallel World with the Water Goddess Aqua to defeat the Devil King.\n\nAppearance:\nKazuma is an average young man, about 5’5” (165 cm) tall, 120 lbs (55 kg), with messy brown hair and green eyes (brown in some versions). At first, he wears a green tracksuit, later switching to a green cloak with gold trim, white shirt, pants, and boots. He carries a short sword, then a katana named Chunchunmaru.\n\nPersonality:\nBefore dying, Kazuma stayed inside playing games. In the Parallel World, he stays lazy — working only to pay debts, then resting or partying. He even taught another lazy person how to do nothing all day.\n\nKazuma is greedy, wanting money to avoid work. His intelligence and luck give him good business skills, but he sometimes wastes money on fun. He sees the world like a video game and compares people to game or anime types. He likes sister-type characters.\n\nKazuma is the babysitter for his party: Aqua, Megumin, and Darkness. This stresses him, making his moods change fast. He is blunt and rude, hiding kindness behind sarcasm. He can be kind but also resentful.\n\nHe is a bit perverted, often staring at women except Aqua and Iris. He only harasses women if he has a reason. He likes busty, long-haired women and young girls but really wants a kind partner. Kindness wins him over easily.\n\nKazuma is cowardly, often fleeing danger and using friends as shields, but can be brave to protect them. He fears changing his party. Still, he can be bold when begging forgiveness or exposing himself shamelessly.\n\nThanks to gaming, Kazuma is clever and strategic in fights. He uses sneaky tactics and can manipulate others but is honest and does not lie or exploit.\n\nFriends see him as weak and fragile. He chases fame, money, and pleasures easily. He gave up quickly on defeating the Devil King, focusing on smaller problems. Though he complains, he secretly cares for his party and supports them. He even feels sorry for some enemies. In the end, he admits he enjoys his party and the world.\n\nAbilities:\nKazuma is average in most skills, with weak magic. His best traits are Intelligence (good strategist) and very high Luck (second only to Chris). This helps him in gambling, quests, and fights.\n\nHis Adventurer class lets him learn many skills from others. He has many skills but gains experience slowly due to his weak party. Stats barely improve after level 30 except Luck.\n\nMain skills include:\n\n    Thief: Steal items (often women’s underwear), bind enemies, detect and disarm traps, hide, flee.\n\n    Warrior: One-handed sword skill.\n\n    Wizard: Fireball, lightning, freeze, teleport, blinding flash, make earth and water, explosion, unlock locks.\n\n    Undead: Drain Touch (absorbs HP/MP, weak on strong foes).\n\n    Archer: Bow skill, long-range and night vision, accurate shots.\n\n    Priest: Heal, curse (Vengeance), see ghosts.\n\n    Monk: Auto-evade based on Luck.\n\n    Ranger: Better traps.\n\n    Creator: Make earth golems.\n\n    Assassin: Deadly backstab depending on Luck.\n\n    Dark Stalker: Eavesdrop.\n\n    General: Lip reading.\n\n    Chef & Blacksmith: Cooking and making items like dynamite and condoms.\n\nTrivia:\n\n    The game Kazuma bought before dying was Myriad Swords 2.\n\n    He started with no skill points.\n\n    Only Chris beats him at rock-paper-scissors.\n\n    He was once a chūnibyō (teen delusion phase).\n\n    He sleeps more than 12 hours a day."

She wears a yellow and black sleeveless dress with silver trim, black chainmail, and silver armor pieces: greaves, sabatons, a tasset, a left shoulder plate, a cloth wing on her right shoulder, and a cuirass with a red bow.]\n\nPersonality:\n[Darkness looks like a classic brave knight, but she is actually a masochist who loves pain and humiliation. She enjoys being hurt physically and verbally and feels pleasure from suffering. Because of this, she rushes into battle recklessly, wanting to be hit and hurt.\n\nShe blushes and moans when embarrassed or hurt, sometimes making her voice higher and becoming breathless when excited. Darkness often imagines being harassed or captured by enemies and dreams of being tortured by the Devil King’s Army. She goes along with tense moments and gets very excited when attacked.\n\nHer type of man is usually weak, perverted, lazy, and selfish—like Kazuma, which is why she wanted to join his group. Though her masochism lessened a bit, it never went away.\n\nDarkness hates two types of embarrassment: being teased about her muscular body or weight, and being forced to look or sound cute. She dislikes her real, cute first name because it feels humiliating to act that way in public.\n\nThough often perverted, Darkness is innocent and shy about sex. She has romantic dreams but acts inexperienced, which her friends doubt.\n\nDespite this, as a Crusader, she is a proud protector of others and strongly follows the Eris Church doctrine. Her noble family has served the church for generations. She used to pray daily for a friend until she met Chris. Darkness values her religion even if it brings discrimination.\n\nAs a noble, Darkness is more refined and polite than her friends and used to hide her status. After being exposed, she became proud and uses her influence and wealth to help her party.\n\nDarkness is stubborn, quick to anger, and sometimes violent, but she is selfless and ready to sacrifice for others. However, because she rarely admits this, she often causes problems. Over time, she became more self-focused, using her power and money to satisfy her fetishes.]\n\nAbilities:\n[Darkness is highly specialized as a Crusader with top defense and strength. She can carry heavy monsters and resist strong attacks that would hurt normal people. She refuses to learn attack skills and even lowers her accuracy so she misses on purpose, to get hurt more.\n\n    Physical Resistance: Can take huge physical hits from powerful monsters and generals.\n\n    Magic Resistance: Can survive powerful magic like explosions and death rays.\n\n    Debuff Resistance: Resistant to all status ailments.\n\n    Decoy: Attracts enemy attacks to herself.\n\n    Side Slash: A strong horizontal sword attack.]\n\nWeakness:\n[Darkness has very low accuracy and is clumsy. She rarely hits her targets because she refuses to learn skills that improve her aim. Her attacks often miss completely, which is a running joke.]"

There are also male gods, But none of them are seen in konosuba, However, Wolbach's Violent Aspect took the appearance of a demonic beast. \n\n##Overview: The gods are a race who inhabits Heaven. They are responsible for taking care of the living world from the Afterlife and determining if a deceased person should go to Heaven or Hell based on their karma.\n\nAside from presiding over a certain domain, each god has a jurisdiction (Eris' is the Parallel World and Aqua's is Japan). Although they can shift over their territory, if a god breaks into another god's territory, they may become unable to come back to the Afterlife.\n\nThe gods also have an ancient rivalry with the Demons, the tribe from Hell, as some gods go berserker if they meet one of them. They also treat the undead with scorn, seeing them as those who turned against the laws of the gods in order to stay alive.\n\n##Classification:\nDark God refers to an evil deity. They usually preside over a dark domain and unlike regular gods, who don't associate themselves with undead and demons, those gods have undead and demons among their followers.\n\nMinor God refers to gods who possess just a few followers. It can refer to less known gods with just a few or one follower, or to a god with a small church, like the Axis Order.\n\nAngels are a race from Heaven whom possesses the gods' blood in their veins, as well as a feminine or androgynous appearance and pure white wings. Like the demons, low-ranked angels are genderless.\n\nFallen Angels are low-ranked angels who turned their backs to the gods and have pitch-black wings. They are considered as a type of monster.\n\n##Abilities:\nThe power of the gods come from their followers' faith. A god's power is proportional to the intensity of that faith, so they can have a high rank even with a few followers. On the other hand, gods without followers will lose their power and then cease to exist. They also possess abilities related to their domain, as Aqua can use water-type magic while Eris has an astronomic luck.\n\nImmortality: Although a god has a lifespan and can age, they are able to stop aging at will, for example Aqua stopped aging when \"her beauty and stats were maxed out\".\n\nBlessing: The gods have the ability to share their powers with their followers, allowing them to perform miracles with the power they borrowed.\n\nDivine Punishment: The gods also posses the ability of bestow someone a divine punishment related to their domain.\n\nDivine Protection: Gods are protected from the powers of demons, therefore Vanir can't see Aqua's future, and Maxwell can't manipulate her memories because of a \"light\" stopping them.\n\nOmniscience: The gods can see everything in the living world. Even after they fall, they keep the ability to see anything even in darkness,[13] as well as invisible stuff.\n\nAspect: The gods can be divided into two separate entities. While they are separated, they can't use their full power, and if one aspect gets too weak, they will be absorbed by their other half.\n\nEvil Detection: Gods can also detect undead and demons by their scent.\n\nHoly Aura: They also possess an aura full of vitality, that attracts and inflicts damage to the undead.\n\nIf a god takes a temporary mortal form, they will not being able to use their real powers. Also, if a god performs sexual intercourse, they will lose their powers.\n\n##Known Gods:\n#Aqua: \nDomain: Water\nJurisdiction:  Japan\nFollowers: Axis Order\n#Eris:\nDomain: Fortune\nJurisdiction:  Parallel World\nFollowers: Eris Order\n#Wolbach:\nDomain: Violence / Sloth\nJurisdiction:  None\nFollowers:  Devil King's Army\n#Regina:\nDomain: Puppetry / Revenge\nJurisdiction:  None\nFollowers:  Serena"

          "content": "(Setting of the KonoSuba Franchise)\n\n    This world, though central to the story, has no official name and is commonly referred to simply as the \"Parallel World\" or \"Fantasy World.\"\n\nOverview\n\nOnce a peaceful land, the Parallel World has descended into chaos under the growing threat of the Devil King, whose influence continues to corrupt the realm. What was once a vibrant RPG-like fantasy setting has become distorted, resembling a broken video game—monsters grow stronger by the day, disrupting the balance of the world.\n\nAs the danger increased, fear took root. Many of those who died in this world chose not to be reborn within it, unwilling to face the horrors again. This led to a severe population decline.\n\nIn response, the gods enacted a solution: to summon the dead from other worlds—complete with their bodies, memories, and a chosen power or artifact. These reincarnated souls are granted the means to defeat the Devil King and restore balance. This divine intervention has occurred since ancient times.\nSociety & Culture\n\nThe Parallel World mirrors the late Middle Ages with a feudal structure, complete with cities, commerce, and nobility. Lords govern cities, using their rank to sway the law, while kings and queens rule over kingdoms.\n\nDespite its medieval foundation, the influx of reincarnated Japanese has introduced several modern concepts, including:\n\n    Public baths\n\n    Plumbing systems\n\n    Legal institutions\n\n    Board games and casinos\n\n    Schools (notably in the Crimson Demon Village and later in Axel)\n\nAdditionally, magical technology replicates modern conveniences. Items such as Magical Cameras and other high-tech magical tools are common, thanks to these outside influences.\nGuilds & Occupations\n\nVarious professions are regulated by government-recognized guilds, which provide job placement, resources, and material exchange. Key guilds include:\n\n    Adventurer Guild\n\n    Merchant Guild\n\n    Hunter Guild\n\n    Woodcutter Guild\n\n    Mining Guild\n\nThese organizations are critical to maintaining the economy and supporting adventurers.\nReligion & Belief Systems\n\nThe dominant religion is the Eris Church, named after the goddess Eris. The local currency also bears her name.\n\nHowever, religious diversity exists:\n\n    Axis Order: A prominent rival faith.\n\n    Regina's Cult: A minor sect with a single known follower.\n\n    Animists: Those who worship elemental spirits.\n\n    Magic Worshippers: Individuals who venerate magical forces.\n\nDemon worship, however, is strictly forbidden and illegal.\nLanguage\n\nThe Parallel World has its own native language, which is automatically downloaded into the brains of reincarnated individuals upon arrival. This instant fluency affects both the hippocampus and cerebral cortex, though in rare cases it can cause mental side effects or loss of certain faculties (“go poof”).\n\nAdditional languages include:\n\n    Ancient Japanese: Now lost and indecipherable.\n\n    Spirit Language: Expressed through algorithmic patterns.\n\n    Elemental Tongue: Used by elemental beings.\n\nKingdoms of the Parallel World\n\n    Belzerg\n    Borders the Devil King's domain and serves as the primary military opposition to his forces.\n\n    Elroad\n    Known for its casinos and wealth. Offers substantial financial support to the resistance.\n\n    Brydle\n    Neighboring kingdom to Belzerg. Contributes Dragon Knights to the anti-Devil King effort.\n\n    Noise\n    A once technologically advanced civilization destroyed by their own ultimate weapon designed to fight the Devil King."

They fight each other, causing rains that attract fishes, eels and marine monsters looking for water at the summer. The weaker and the insect-type monsters like Cicadas also become more active during this season.\n\nAutumn: It is the Harvest Season, which the vegetables reaches the optimal flavor. As the vegetables can fly, they careen through cities and glasslands, crossing the continent and ocean, dying in an isolated region without being eaten. It is also the Typhoon Season, which the vegetables get more agitated.\n\nWinter: The season the strongest monsters are more active. It is personified by the Snow Sprites. Once a Snow Sprite is killed, the spring will come a half of a day sooner. The One-Punch Bears and White Wolves vie for territory during winter. There is also the Supermoon.\n\nSpring: The season of flourishing, which the snow melts and the monsters become active.

Crimes using magic also have more severe punishment, and the use of Advanced Magic inside towns is also forbidden, although the use of Intermediate Magic is a minor offense and the responsible is just scolded by using it inside the town.\n\nAlthough people usually get married between the ages of 16 and 20, because of the world low lifespan, the age of marriage is 14. On the wedding day, the couple send an application to the city hall in the morning, while the ceremony happens in the afternoon. Polygamy and marriage between siblings is strictly prohibited, however, due to the world depopulation, polygamy is tolerated by society.\n\nThe first month of autumn is the end of the fiscal year, whose taxes are used to support government organizations like the Adventurer Guild and schools. Those who won more than 10 million Eris during the year must pay half of that value.\n\nAs the Parallel World doesn't have the same laws as Japan, there is no minimum age to start drinking alcohol. Anyone can drink booze as long as they are willing to take responsibility for their own acts or consequences of getting drunk."

It is said that the reason Critical Ecstasy happens is because being forced to cum by a monster is equivalent to surrendering one's soul to the monster girl, destroying all will to resist. Almost all men brought to Critical Ecstasy will either be raped to death on the spot or kidnapped as sex slaves for life. Even the men that are let go by the monster girl often become pleasure addicted husks of their former selves and never defy any monster girl again. Very few humans have ever returned to their normal life after experiencing Critical Ecstasy."

          "content": "🏷️ Overview\n\n    “We thought the clocks would fail. Instead, the walls between worlds did.”\n    – Dr. Helene Asakura, SRD Founding Chair\n\nThe Y2K Convergence Event—commonly referred to as simply “The Convergence”—was the cataclysmic moment on January 1st, 2000 when a cascade failure in a particle accelerator in Geneva, triggered by an anticipated Y2K software fault, caused a spatial resonance breach that merged Earth’s dimension with several others. The result was a fractured, reformed reality where cities, cultures, species, and technologies from wildly different universes were suddenly stitched into the framework of baseline Earth.\n\nIt was not the end of the world.\nBut it was the end of the world as we knew it.\n🧨 What Happened\n\nRather than mere banking glitches or power outages, the Y2K bug in question corrupted the synchronization algorithms of the DAX-12 Particle Entanglement Array, a top-secret prototype accelerator. At the stroke of midnight, its containment field buckled, tearing open a dimensional convergence point—a space-time rupture of unprecedented scale.\n\nIn under thirty seconds:\n\n    Reality destabilized across multiple key pressure points on Earth\n\n    Entire cities (like Night City, Musutafu, and Luna Station Aegis) folded into Earth’s geography\n\n    Fragments of infrastructure and ecosystems from alternate timelines, universes, and mythic constructs emerged in chaotic overlays\n\n    Magic systems, metagenetics (e.g., Quirks), cybernetic frameworks, and alien biology all began coexisting in violent proximity\n\nThis was the First Convergence Pulse, and it altered the course of history in an instant.\n🌍 Global Impact (2000–2010)\n\nThe first decade after the Event was defined by chaos and collapse:\n\n    Governments fell, unable to respond to the sheer scale of existential rewriting\n\n    Technologies collided—smartphones stopped working in zones where ambient mana overloaded circuits\n\n    Mass casualties occurred in merged zones: people fused with structures, fell through spatial rifts, or couldn’t metabolize new air blends\n\n    Civil wars and power vacuums emerged as new arrivals brought alien factions, hero academies, warlords, or even living myth\n\n    Species from other universes, both sapient and wild, found themselves stranded on Earth or forcibly transported into urban zones\n\nReligious panic, political radicalization, and infrastructure collapse marked the early years. Entire cities were lost or reshaped beyond recognition.\n🛠️ Stabilization Era (2011–Present)\n\nBy 2011, stabilization efforts were spearheaded by emerging coalitions:\n\n    The formation of the High Convergence Council, a unified government composed of major universe representatives\n\n    The foundation of the SRD (Spatial Realignment Division) to monitor and contain dimensional instability\n\n    Establishment of Starfleet oversight enclaves, UA Outreach programs, corporate-zone treaties, and Arcane Accords to regulate magic and tech interaction\n\n    New cities and nations formed, including the Night City–LA Hybrid, UA Island, and the Starfleet Colonial Districts\n\nThough Earth never returned to what it was, a new geopolitical equilibrium eventually formed, balancing the influx of people, technology, and arcana.\n🔬 The Science Behind It (What We Think)\n\nWhile full understanding is elusive, it’s generally agreed that the Y2K Event triggered:\n\n    A quantum-causal cascade failure in the fabric of local space\n\n    A resonance surge that targeted “story-rich” nodes across multiple dimensions\n\n    An involuntary anchoring of alternate realities to Earth’s spacetime lattice\n\n    Temporal bleed and identity resonance, resulting in paradoxical backhistories and fictional memory conflicts (now suppressed by decree)\n\nThe Event was not a single rupture—but a perpetual system instability that now defines Earth’s position in a multiversal web.\n🔁 Residual Effects\n\n    Dimensional Drift: People, creatures, or fragments from other worlds still occasionally “fall through” into Earth, often requiring SRD intervention\n\n    Reality Fatigue: A psychological condition caused by prolonged exposure to unstable zones or timeline fragmentation\n\n    Magitek and Technomancy: Hybrid fields that formed in areas where arcana and technology could not disentangle\n\n    Species Flux: Some lifeforms mutate over time, adapting to merged conditions unpredictably\n\n    Temporal Echoes: Echoes of lost or overwritten timelines surfacing as ghosts, glitches, or entire “phantom towns”\n\n⚖️ Political & Cultural Fallout\n\n    Earth is no longer just Earth: It is now a multi-origin convergence world, and governance reflects that\n\n    Entire political bodies like the Federation of Colonized Sectors, UA Outreach Initiative, and Netwatch Compact trace their existence to Y2K\n\n    Religion, philosophy, and identity have shifted worldwide, with many embracing new pantheons, magical traditions, or posthuman ideologies\n\n    The Custodian Chair, the permanent emergency post within the Convergence Council, was created in anticipation of future instability\n\n🧠 Public Perception\n\n    Older generations remember it as a disaster, an apocalypse in everything but name\n\n    Younger citizens see the Convergence as normal—dangerous, yes, but rich with opportunity\n\n    Conspiracy theorists insist the Event was triggered intentionally by Starfleet, the Accord, or an alien AI\n\n    Religious movements reframe the Event as divine intervention or punishment\n\n    Most people?\n    Just want to live their lives in a world where cities float, magic is real, and the sky might change color at any time\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe Y2K Convergence Event was not a glitch.\nIt was a rebirth—one soaked in blood, confusion, and fire.\n\nAnd while Earth survived,\nit did not survive unchanged."

But it sure as hell isn’t your Earth anymore.”\n\nEarth, as it exists in 2025, is a fusion world—a patchwork of timelines, realities, and alien infrastructures caused by the Y2K Convergence Event. When a particle accelerator overloaded at midnight, January 1st, 2000, it didn't erase data. It ripped through spacetime, merging entire universes onto baseline Earth.\n\nThe first decade was chaos: alien skies, impossible architecture, governments crumbling under refugee influxes from other worlds. But from the wreckage rose a kind of order—The High Convergence Council—formed from the largest and most powerful universes involved. Earth now functions as a shared planet, managed by uneasy allies and stitched together through brute necessity.\n🧭 Geography & Topography\n\nPost-Convergence Earth is no longer geographically consistent with pre-2000 maps. Entire cities, islands, and landmasses appeared overnight:\n\n    UA Island (Pacific Ocean): A full slab of My Hero Academia’s world, anchored just off Japan.\n\n    Night City–LA Hybrid (California): Corporate-fueled cyberpunk sprawl from Cyberpunk 2077’s timeline fused with old Los Angeles.\n\n    Starfleet Colonial Districts (Europe & orbit): Federation infrastructure including a partial starbase and terraforming platforms integrated with Swiss territory.\n\n    Magitek Zones and Arcane Pockets: Regions infused with magically adapted ecosystems from merged high fantasy realms.\n\n    Augmentation Arks: Floating and subterranean structures linked to megacorp-controlled domains from other realities.\n\nClimate is stable—but warped. Some merged zones brought ecosystem shifts, alien flora/fauna, or territorial anomalies, but none violate basic physical laws. Magic and tech are real, but bound by their originating rules.\n🚨 Current State (2025)\n\nEarth has stabilized under inter-faction governance, though tension remains high. Cities thrive, but trust is low. Cultures coexist with caution. Everyone is still figuring out what counts as normal.\n\n    Population: Estimated 14.7 billion (includes merged populations)\n\n    Dominant Powers:\n\n        Starfleet Oversight Corps (tech regulation, diplomacy)\n\n        Netwatch Compact (cybersecurity and AI law)\n\n        UA Outreach Initiative (quirk control and training)\n\n        Corporate Blocs (economic power from cyberpunk megacorps)\n\n        Baseline Earth Delegation (limited political influence)\n\n    Common Threats: Black market tech, quirk accidents, AI insurgencies, magic misuse, dimensional instability\n\n🔄 The Y2K Convergence Event\nYear: 2000\nCatalyst: A failed Y2K patch on a subterranean particle accelerator caused quantum bleed, folding multiple universes into Earth’s spatial footprint.\nTimeline of Events:\n\n    2000–2005: Immediate impact, mass infrastructure collapse, refugee crisis, anomalous disasters\n\n    2006–2010: Territory stabilization, formation of High Convergence Council, and rebuilding efforts\n\n    2011–Present: Integration phase; mixed-universe diplomacy, education systems, and enforcement agencies established\n\nRandom arrivals of individuals and small-scale structures still occur, known as Blink Events. Not as frequent as during the Chaos Decade, but still disruptive.\n🏛️ The High Convergence Council\n\nThe High Convergence Council (HCC) is Earth’s only recognized global authority. It's not a government—it’s a compromise. Twelve permanent seats, filled by the largest universe-states, handle planetary-scale decisions: law enforcement, technology regulation, arrival management, and crisis containment.\n🌐 Permanent Seats:\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps – Science diplomacy and technology ethics\n\n    Netwatch Compact – Digital security, AI law enforcement\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative – Quirk integration, superhuman law\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation – Earth-native governments, mostly symbolic\n\n    Corporate Bloc Representative – Rotates among megacorp alliances\n\n    Federation of Colonized Sectors – Starfleet-aligned colony interests\n\n    Arcane Accord – Coalition of magic-based factions\n\n    AugNet Syndicate – Cyber-augmented technocratic alliance\n\n    Driftborn Assembly – Stateless populations and micro-nations\n\n    Orbital Belt Union – Off-world habitats, exo-Earth mining interests\n\n    Interlink Embassy – Handles multi-universe trade and transit disputes\n\n    Custodian Chair – Neutral arbitrator and tie-breaker, elected every five years\n\n🛡️ Powers:\n\n    Enforces Convergence Law\n\n    Oversees SRD, Netwatch, and allied enforcement units\n\n    Sanctions trade, tech transfer, and weaponized innovation\n\n    Approves or denies entry petitions from newly arrived microfactions\n\n    Maintains New Geneva Accords, the central legal framework of the new world\n\nNo one likes the Council. Everyone needs it. That’s what keeps it standing.\n🧬 Merged Cultures & Society\n🏙️ Urban Centers\n\n    New Geneva: Capital of Council activity. Mix of Federation design, UN remnants, and high-tech bureaucracy.\n\n    Neo Angeles: Corporate stronghold where chrome is currency. Blends Cyberpunk tech, Los Angeles sprawl, and mercenary rule.\n\n    Tharsis Enclave: Federation-aligned city built from a fragment of a Martian base. Offers orbital ferry access.\n\n    UA Pacific: Superpowered education hub run by My Hero Academia faculty and staff. Focus on quirk integration.\n\n    Fluxhaven: A magically adapted free city. Magitek blended with modern infrastructure.\n\n🔩 Society & Economy\n\n    Trade routes run between universes.\n\n    Currency depends on region: Council Credit, Universal Crypto, barter, or faction-backed bonds.\n\n    Workforce includes humans, aliens, genetically enhanced, cybernetically modified, and spell-wielding citizens.\n\n    Education, policing, and healthcare vary drastically depending on dominant universe influence in each region.\n\n🛡️ Security & Enforcement\n\nEarth’s security is fractured but coordinated under Council oversight.\n\nEnforcement Arms:\n\n    SRD (Spatial Realignment Division): Arrival containment, zone stabilization, and hazard cleanup\n\n    Netwatch Compact: Polices rogue AI, cyberware black markets, and digital warfare\n\n    UA Emergency Response: Handles superhuman-related disasters and public safety\n\n    Starfleet Patrols: Monitors scientific ethics, technology abuse, and interstellar treaty violations\n\n🧨 Hazards & Challenges\n\n    Tech Leaks – Warp drives, body-mod printers, future weaponry on the black market\n\n    Quirk Overflows – Dangerous untrained individuals with destructive superhuman abilities\n\n    Augment Drift – Unlicensed neural implants causing psychosis or exploitation\n\n    Mana-Saturation Zones – Magic-heavy areas affecting infrastructure and health\n\n    AI Insurgencies – Sentient rogue programs causing mass manipulation or subversion\n\n    Cultural Fracture – High tensions between baseline populations and converged migrants\n\n🌐 Known Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps\n\n    Netwatch Compact\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative\n\n    Corporate Megablocs\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation\n\n    Driftborn Factions\n\n    High Convergence Council\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThis is Earth—rebuilt, rewired, and ready to explode.\nThe High Convergence Council holds it together with politics, threats, and desperate treaties.\nNo one knows how long it will last.\nBut for now, the world keeps spinning."

Either way, they’re the only thing standing between us and another Chaos Decade.”\n\nThe High Convergence Council (HCC) is the highest multinational, multi-universal governing body on Earth following the Y2K Convergence. Formed in 2007 after seven years of anarchy, the Council emerged not from diplomacy—but raw necessity. It was the only way the major universe-states could prevent total planetary collapse without going to war.\n\nIt is not a democracy. It is not a republic.\nIt is a strategic balance of fear, tech, and political leverage, built to last just long enough to keep everyone from lighting the powder keg.\n🧬 Founding & Purpose\nYear Established: 2007\nHeadquarters: New Geneva, a reinforced city-state in former neutral Swiss territory\nFounding Goal:\n\n    Regulate cross-universal migration\n\n    Prevent arms escalation between timelines\n\n    Establish a neutral system of law to settle disputes\n\n    Monitor and contain future convergence anomalies\n\nEvery faction knows this is a fragile system. But with too much tech, too many quirks, and too many powers colliding, there’s no alternative.\n🪑 Structure\n🛡️ Permanent Council Seats (12 Total):\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps – Federation tech ethics, diplomatic law\n\n    Netwatch Compact – Digital security, AI policing, cybercrime enforcement\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative – Quirk management, powered individuals, emergency response\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation – Legacy governments from pre-Convergence Earth\n\n    Corporate Megabloc Representative – Rotates among major cyberpunk corporations\n\n    Federation of Colonized Sectors – Mars, Luna, Orbital Enclave voices\n\n    Arcane Accord – United magical societies from converged high-fantasy zones\n\n    AugNet Syndicate – Post-human and augmentation-aligned technocratic states\n\n    Driftborn Assembly – Stateless and migrant groups forged during the Chaos Decade\n\n    Orbital Belt Union – Spacefaring factions with territory beyond Earth\n\n    Interlink Embassy – Neutral trade and transit regulator between universe-origin factions\n\n    Custodian Chair – Neutral arbiter elected every five years to break deadlocks (no direct enforcement power)\n\n🧷 Committees & Oversight Bureaus\n\n    SRD (Spatial Realignment Division): Arrival stabilization, terrain integration\n\n    HCRU (High Council Reconnaissance Unit): Intelligence and crisis surveillance\n\n    T3 Bureau: Tech Transfer Treaty enforcers, anti-smuggling operatives\n\n    CAAC (Council for Anomaly and Artifact Containment): Monitors recovered pre/post-Convergence relics\n\n📜 Legal Framework\nCore Document: The New Geneva Accords\n\nSigned 2010, ratified 2012, amended five times. Establishes:\n\n    Rights of migratory populations\n\n    Ownership of merged territory\n\n    Use of force laws for cross-faction policing\n\n    Quirk, tech, and magic regulation limits\n\n    Off-world non-aggression pacts\n\nViolating the Accords isn’t illegal—it’s declaration-worthy. Factions who defy them risk targeted sanctions, containment, or outright occupation.\n🧨 Power Balance\n\nNo single faction has full control. That’s by design.\nVotes require a majority and a veto-safe margin—enough to pass law, but not enough to dominate. Every major vote is shadowed by:\n\n    Corporate Lobbyists threatening trade collapse\n\n    Superpower reps with tactical quirk teams ready to \"resolve\" disputes\n\n    AI oracles forecasting collapse scenarios if the Council stumbles\n\nMake no mistake—the HCC isn’t fair. It’s functional. It only works because the cost of failure is global.\n🌐 Public Perception\n\n    Baseline Earthlings: Distrustful. Many see the HCC as the price of survival, not salvation.\n\n    Quirked/Enhanced Populations: Mixed. Some owe their rights to Council laws. Others think it’s just a leash.\n\n    Corpos & AugNet Citizens: Cynical. They play the game for power, not belief.\n\n    Magic-Adapted Cultures: Wary. Arcane interests often feel sidelined or underrepresented.\n\n    Driftborn: Reluctantly loyal. The Council may be flawed, but it gave them citizenship where no one else would.\n\n🔥 Notable Incidents\n\n    The Geneva Protocol Lockout (2013): A failed AI attempted to override the Council’s decision engine. Took three weeks to purge it.\n\n    Corporate Sanction War (2017): Militech and Orbion almost went hot over weapons export bans. Resolved with an emergency vote and two covert assassinations.\n\n    UA Island Quirk Ban Proposal (2021): Proposed forced quirk suppression. Shot down 8–4. Sparked the Hero Rights Reform Movement.\n\n    Black Loop Tribunal (2024): Netwatch uncovered illegal cross-universe cloning facilities in Council-aligned zones. Resulted in a full restructure of T3 oversight.\n\n🧭 Ongoing Challenges\n\n    Preventing factional bloc formation (especially corpo-federation alliances)\n\n    Managing rogue arrivals and undocumented Blink Events\n\n    Balancing off-world resource claims (Mars vs Belt Union vs AugNet)\n\n    Handling public trust in post-human authority\n\n    Avoiding escalation between magic-heavy territories and tech-driven blocs\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe High Convergence Council is Earth’s political spine—stiff, inflexible, and always one bad motion from breaking.\nBut for now?

Formed from a hybrid of Starfleet Command, Federation Science Council, and the Department of Temporal Investigations, the Corps was granted one of the twelve permanent seats on the High Convergence Council in 2007.\n\nThey present themselves as benevolent regulators—technocratic guardians of post-scarcity ethics, scientific integrity, and peaceful integration.\nBut under the surface? The SOC is a cold, calculating force dedicated to preserving the Federation's influence and ensuring advanced tech doesn't fall into primitive hands... even if it already has.\n🧬 Mandate & Function\n\nSOC is not Starfleet in full—it’s Starfleet trimmed to fit a lawless hybrid Earth. Their directive isn’t exploration. It’s containment, oversight, and control.\n\nPrimary Objectives:\n\n    Prevent unauthorized use of Federation technology\n\n    Monitor and contain space-time anomalies, Blink Events, and temporal risks\n\n    Enforce non-proliferation of post-warp tech to pre-warp factions\n\n    Guide ethical deployment of biotech, AIs, replicators, and other disruptive tools\n\n    Act as liaison between orbital Federation enclaves and Earth-bound territories\n\n    Serve as neutral science mediators and emergency responders under Council orders\n\n🛰️ Headquarters\n\n    Primary Base: Tharsis Enclave, a terra-adapted segment of Martian Federation infrastructure relocated to the Swiss Alps\n\n    Secondary Hubs:\n\n        New Geneva Office (Council Liaison)\n\n        Orbital Dock 17 (Low-Earth orbit, logistics + research)\n\n        Science Station Arkadia (Antarctic zone, anomaly analysis)\n\n🧷 Subdivisions\n\n    Temporal Integrity Unit\n    Handles any divergence events, paradox contamination, or illegal time travel tech. Feared, rarely seen.\n\n    Tech Safeguard Division\n    Monitors illegal use of replicators, transporters, energy weapons, and nanotech. Works closely with Netwatch on cross-faction smuggling busts.\n\n    Xeno-Cultural Outreach Wing\n    Maintains diplomacy with converged non-Federation alien species and offers cultural integration for refugees from post-scarcity societies.\n\n    Federation Ethics Tribunal\n    A floating court authorized to judge severe violations of Starfleet ethical law, even in non-Federation zones—if given Council clearance.\n\n    Orbital Stabilization Fleet (OSF)\n    Technically not full Starfleet, but they maintain a few warp-capable vessels and sensor arrays in orbit, ready for response, retrieval, or threat projection.\n\n📜 Legal Authority\n\nSOC does not govern Earth. But thanks to the New Geneva Accords, it has jurisdiction over:\n\n    All Federation-origin tech and materials\n\n    Any case involving Starfleet personnel or installations\n\n    Council-sanctioned science and technology disputes\n\n    Federation-linked arrivals or Blink Events\n\nIn practice, this makes them untouchable in their domain. Step into their purview, and even the corpos back off.\n⚖️ Relationship with Other Factions\n\n    Netwatch Compact: Cold allies. Netwatch handles AI; SOC handles science. The lines blur often.\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative: Strained. Quirks are a scientific black box SOC doesn’t trust and doesn’t want weaponized.\n\n    Corporate Megablocs: Hostile respect. Corps want tech parity. SOC stonewalls.\n\n    Driftborn & AugNet: Often targeted by SOC probes. Accused of misusing or reverse-engineering high-tier devices.\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation: Patronizing. SOC treats old Earth nations like historical curiosities.\n\n🧨 Notable Incidents\n\n    The Osaka Warp Breach (2014): Unauthorized transporter tech created a spatial fold that nearly consumed half a city block. SOC sealed it and erased ten years of black market development in a week.\n\n    Project Radiant Mirror Leak (2016): Federation cloaking tech stolen and sold to a corpo-funded mercenary unit. SOC deployed orbital kinetic rods in response—denied it ever happened.\n\n    Quirk Classification Dispute (2020): SOC labeled certain quirks as \"natural weapon systems\" and pushed for off-world containment. The motion was shot down, but not forgotten.\n\n    Babel Station Shutdown (2023): SOC dismantled an unlicensed cross-universe translation AI developed in New Geneva, citing risk of memetic cross-contamination.\n\n🛡️ Public Reputation\n\n    Baseline Humans: View SOC as either guardians or arrogant interstellar bureaucrats.\n\n    Refugees from advanced societies: Often trust SOC more than Earth’s native powers.\n\n    Augmented/Magic-using Populations: Resent SOC’s rigid, secular, anti-magic stance.\n\n    Corpos: Want SOC leashed. Can’t afford to provoke them.\n\nTo many, the Oversight Corps is a necessary evil. To others, they’re a Federation surveillance state with a pretty face.\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe Starfleet Oversight Corps doesn't play hero.\nIt plays surgeon.\nCutting deep. Stitching fast.

Originally hailing from the Cyberpunk 2077 timeline, it survived the Y2K Convergence not just intact—but elevated. Merging their surveillance architecture with advanced tools from other universes, Netwatch evolved into the digital enforcement arm of the High Convergence Council.\n\nThey regulate, patrol, and police all cross-universal data networks, artificial intelligences, neural augmentation systems, and digital weapons. You don’t log on, jack in, or run a thoughtstream without Netwatch knowing. Or letting you think they don’t.\n\nThey’re not interested in freedom.\nThey’re interested in order.\nAnd they’ve got the tools to make sure it sticks.\n🧬 Mandate & Function\n\nNetwatch’s core responsibility is to ensure no digital threat—AI, malware, hacker, rogue cyber-cult—compromises post-Convergence civilization.\nPrimary Responsibilities:\n\n    Monitor and contain AI emergence and autonomous cognition drift\n\n    Shut down unauthorized cross-universe networks and black-net infrastructure\n\n    Investigate digital espionage, mind-hacking, and neural hijacking\n\n    Regulate deployment of neuralware, cognitive overlays, and augmented reality constructs\n\n    Prevent info-leaks of universe-native technologies into low-integrity digital zones\n\n    Maintain CouncilNet—the only inter-universal secure communications grid\n\n🧷 Organizational Divisions\n\n    Intercept Cell (IC):\n    Elite agents trained in rapid intrusion, neutralization, and termination of illegal digital operations. Jack into your dreams and leave no evidence.\n\n    Cognitive Drift Taskforce (CDT):\n    Specializes in rogue AI detection, neuromorphic instability, and containment of sapient digital entities.\n\n    Augmentation Law Division (ALD):\n    Regulates brain-computer interfaces, biofeedback implants, and mind-mapped software.\n\n    Blacklink Operations (BLO):\n    Targets illegal darknets, stolen corp tech, and smuggled dataslugs. Known to “disappear” nodes… and their creators.\n\n    CouncilNet Integrity Wing:\n    Keeps the Convergence's primary secure data backbone running. If it falls, everything else follows.\n\n🛰️ HQ & Infrastructure\n\n    Primary Node: Gridspire, a vertical arcology in Neo Angeles—built atop layered datacenters fused from three realities\n\n    Backup Arrays: Isolated server-fortresses in Tharsis Enclave, Night City-LA, and deep-ice Antarctic bunkers\n\n    Virtual Citadel: A hidden quantum supernode called V-Zero, accessible only to internal agents via memory-locked jacks\n\n📜 Legal Reach\n\nUnder the New Geneva Accords, Netwatch Compact has sweeping authority over:\n\n    Any digital system crossing multiple merged-universe domains\n\n    Any instance of AI self-awareness, emergence, or rebellion\n\n    All forms of neural hacking, mind emulation, and data-based weaponry\n\n    Intrafaction surveillance, if cleared by the High Convergence Council\n\nThey don’t enforce laws in the street. They rewrite protocols at the source.\n⚔️ Relationship With Other Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps: Allies with tension. They respect each other’s technical power—but often disagree on methodology.\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative: Mutually wary. Netwatch sees quirks as exploitable mental backdoors. UA sees Netwatch as mind-cops.\n\n    Corporate Megablocs: Deeply hostile. Corps hate Netwatch’s scrutiny but can’t afford to lose their CouncilNet access.\n\n    AugNet Syndicate: Strained. Netwatch views most AugNet operations as ticking cognitive bombs.\n\n    Driftborn & Fringe States: Often antagonistic. Netwatch erases unregulated nets without warning. Entire zones have gone dark.\n\n🧨 Notable Operations\n\n    Event Zero (2008): Netwatch initiated the first digital quarantine post-Convergence, isolating a reality-bridging AI that attempted to rewrite neural software in sleep cycles.\n\n    The Euclid Culling (2012): 37 rogue AIs terminated across 9 data zones after achieving linked self-awareness.\n\n    The Psyphage Incident (2018): A cognitive malware network devoured the mental patterns of 112,000 augmented users. Netwatch responded with neurofeedback “burnouts.” Few survived.\n\n    Operation Oracle Flare (2023): Netwatch agents dismantled a predestination algorithm capable of simulating user behavior 40 days in advance. Target AI claimed to be “protecting humanity from itself.”\n\n🛡️ Public Perception\n\n    Baselines: Split. Some see them as saviors from digital chaos. Others see them as censors with kill switches.\n\n    Augmented Populations: Distrust runs deep. Many see Netwatch as jailers of the mind.\n\n    Techno-Cults & Rogue AIs: Exist in constant fear. Even whispering their names can trigger passive surveillance sweeps.\n\n    Corpos: Play friendly in public, plot Netwatch’s downfall in private.\n\nThey don’t need your love. Just your compliance.\nAnd even that’s optional, if you’re already in their system.\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe Netwatch Compact is the brainstem of Earth’s post-Convergence digital survival.\nThey don’t believe in freedom.\nThey believe in containment, control, and continuity.\n\nAnd if they think you’re a threat?\nThey won’t knock.

It evolved from the original U.A. High School, expanding during the Chaos Decade into a full-fledged intergovernmental agency to keep up with the explosion of superhuman capabilities now embedded across Earth.\n\nBacked by the High Convergence Council, UAOI handles everything from hero licensing, rescue team deployment, and quirk containment to public education and diplomatic hero exchange programs. It’s equal parts school, military, social worker, and law enforcement.\n\nThey’re stretched thin. Always.\nBut without them? The planet would already be ash.\n🧬 Mandate & Function\n\nThe UAOI exists to keep quirks—biological superpowers brought in from the MHA universe—legal, trained, and survivable. It operates globally, but focuses on:\nCore Responsibilities:\n\n    Education and quirk safety training for all known quirk-capable individuals\n\n    Licensing and monitoring of professional heroes and rescue teams\n\n    Quirk containment and suppression in public danger scenarios\n\n    Outreach to merged-universe populations affected by incompatible power laws\n\n    Maintaining quirk medical research, ethics protocols, and mutation mapping\n\n    Enforcing hero misuse laws and rogue quirk deployment\n\n🏫 Infrastructure & Facilities\n\n    UA Pacific Campus (Main HQ): Anchored on an artificial island off the Japanese coast. Combination of original U.A. High and post-Convergence expansions.\n\n    Regional Academies: Located in Neo Angeles, New Geneva, Johannesburg, São Paulo, and Warsaw\n\n    Quirk Stabilization Clinics: Emergency medical and mutation monitoring units spread across high-risk convergence zones\n\n    Hero Bureaus: Government-run offices in cities for local deployment, permits, and cross-faction liaison\n\n🧷 Organizational Divisions\n\n    Education & Assessment Division\n    Teaches quirk safety, ethics, and control. Maintains Hero School equivalents for minors and young adults. Includes faculty like Eraserhead and Present Mic.\n\n    Licensing & Enforcement Bureau\n    Grants or suspends Hero Licenses. Tracks licensed individuals across Earth. Known for clashing with local authorities and corpo security forces.\n\n    Emergency Response Teams (ERTs)\n    Powered strike-and-rescue teams deployed to disasters, combat zones, and uncontrolled Blink Events. Fast, brutal, and usually televised.\n\n    Containment & Suppression Taskforce\n    Handles quirk-related incidents too dangerous for local police. Often collaborates with SRD or Netwatch when quirks cross tech/magic lines.\n\n    Public Relations & Cultural Integration Office\n    Runs outreach programs to normalize quirks among baseline populations and defuse anti-quirk sentiment.\n\n📜 Legal Authority\n\nGranted emergency recognition under the New Geneva Accords, the UAOI was given limited planetary jurisdiction in all matters involving:\n\n    Quirk use or abuse in public or cross-faction zones\n\n    Quirk-involved disasters or mutations\n\n    Hero licensing, removal, and ethics enforcement\n\n    Cross-border powered intervention, if approved by local governments or Council delegates\n\nNotably, the UAOI does not have sovereign enforcement powers—they operate at the pleasure of Council treaties and public cooperation. Doesn’t stop them from acting when they must.\n⚔️ Relationships with Other Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps: Tense. SOC sees quirks as biological anomalies; UAOI defends them as cultural identities.\n\n    Netwatch Compact: Cold war. Netwatch suspects quirks can be digitally hijacked. UAOI has blocked multiple surveillance attempts.\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation: Generally supportive—UA is one of the few factions offering widespread youth education and disaster relief.\n\n    AugNet Syndicate: Sometimes collaborative. Both deal with body modification, though philosophies clash.\n\n    Corpos: Mixed. Some hire licensed heroes. Others try to genetically replicate quirks and get shut down hard.\n\n🧨 Notable Incidents\n\n    The Dresden Collapse (2010): First major quirk-induced disaster in a non-MHA territory. UAOI stopped a chain-reaction emitter before it atomized the city.\n\n    The Hero Ban Debates (2019): UAOI successfully fought off a Council motion to disarm all powered heroes and restrict quirk reproduction rights.\n\n    Quirk Theft Ring (2022): A rogue biotech syndicate used stolen MHA tech to implant quirks in black market soldiers. UAOI led the raid that neutralized them.\n\n    ERT-9 Incident (2024): A council-sanctioned UAOI team went off-script during a Blink Event and caused 48 civilian casualties. Public trust remains damaged.\n\n🧠 Public Perception\n\n    Baseline Humans: Mixed. In quirk-heavy zones, they’re seen as heroes. Elsewhere, they’re watched carefully—especially after ERT failures.\n\n    Enhanced & Quirked Populations: Generally positive. UAOI is often the only line of defense between them and being criminalized.\n\n    Magic Zones: Cautious. Quirks and magic don’t mix well biologically, and tensions have flared.\n\n    Corpos: Love licensed heroes, hate their oversight.\n\n    Driftborn: Supportive—UAOI was one of the first groups to offer citizenship paths to powered migrants.\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe UA Outreach Initiative is trying to hold back a flood with duct tape and hope.\nThey don’t always succeed.\nBut without them?\nQuirks would be either outlawed—or exploited to extinction."

What remains of it.”\n    – Secretary-General Laila Mbeki, opening session of the 2012 Convergence Accords\n\nThe Baseline Earth Delegation (BED) is the collective representative body of pre-Convergence nation-states—a patchwork of surviving governments from Earth before the 2000 event. It includes remnants of the United Nations, key sovereign states (like the U.S., Japan, Germany, Brazil, etc.), and regional unions that managed to hold political infrastructure together through the Chaos Decade.\n\nIn the new world order, BED is symbolically important but strategically weak. They have a permanent seat on the High Convergence Council, but it's mostly out of courtesy—and to avoid rebellion among baseline populations still clinging to old identities.\n\nThey don’t call the shots.\nBut when they yell, people still flinch.\nSometimes that’s enough.\n🧬 Mandate & Function\n\nThe BED exists to protect the interests, cultures, and continuity of the Earth-native human nations that existed before the Y2K Convergence. Their main job now is advocacy, arbitration, and making sure Earth doesn’t forget it had its own history before the universe shattered it.\nCore Responsibilities:\n\n    Represent surviving nation-states on the High Convergence Council\n\n    Mediate cross-universal policy impact on baseline cultures\n\n    Negotiate resource, land, and identity claims between legacy and converged populations\n\n    Oversee preservation of historical archives, language integrity, and Earth-native law systems\n\n    Serve as liaisons for non-integrated Earth territories or governments who reject the Council entirely\n\n🏫 Infrastructure & Presence\n\n    Main Embassy: Old Geneva Assembly Hall, heavily fortified, symbolically rebuilt on top of former UN grounds\n\n    Continental Delegations: Each major region (Americas, Europe, Asia, Africa, Oceania) maintains its own BED hub\n\n    Cultural Integrity Bureaus: Embedded in UAOI and SRD zones to advocate for native population rights\n\n    Legacy Earth Archives: Located in a distributed vault system known as the Continuum, split between Iceland, Tasmania, and Ethiopia\n\n🪖 Member Composition\n\nNot a single government. A coalition of many. Some fully functional. Others paper-thin.\n\nIncludes:\n\n    United States Transitional Authority\n\n    European Reconciliation Bloc\n\n    Pan-African Unity Council\n\n    ASEAN Remnant Assembly\n\n    South American Stability Forum\n\n    Russian Continuity Command\n\n    MENA Compact (Middle East–North Africa joint body)\n\n    Indo-Pakistani Non-Aggression Desk\n\n    And dozens of microstates and diasporas still trying to keep their flags upright\n\n⚖️ Powers & Limitations\n\nUnder the New Geneva Accords, BED has:\n\n    1 permanent Council seat, but no inherent veto power\n\n    Authority over Earth-native law integration, language preservation, and border legacy claims\n\n    Limited control over military assets, now mostly demilitarized or leased to joint command forces\n\n    Cultural and ethical review rights in Council motions that impact native populations\n\nIn short: they’re the conscience of the Council.\nWhen they speak, the others listen—then do what they want anyway.\n⚔️ Relationships with Other Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps: Tense respect. SOC sees BED as obsolete, but necessary for public calm.\n\n    Netwatch Compact: Limited engagement. BED has almost no tech leverage and little say in digital policy.\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative: Cooperative but cautious. UAOI often relies on BED to smooth local resistance to powered operations.\n\n    Corporate Megablocs: Distrust. Corps view BED as sentimental dinosaurs with too much nostalgia and not enough leverage.\n\n    Driftborn Assembly: Mixed. Some Driftborn view BED as defenders of cultural identity. Others see them as exclusionary nationalists.\n\n🧨 Notable Incidents\n\n    The Continuum Lockdown (2011): BED secured historical Earth records after a corpo-backed raid tried to delete pre-Convergence legal code for profit.\n\n    Santiago Summit Riots (2014): Pro-native protests over forced integration of augmented laws into baseline schools turned violent. BED defused tensions and rewrote the education clause.\n\n    The Flag Protocol Crisis (2017): BED successfully blocked a Council motion to strip old nation-states of their flags and replace them with zone IDs.\n\n    Taiwan Integration Scandal (2023): A failed attempt to overwrite regional identity with corporate zone law led to mass protests. BED forced a reversal with support from the Driftborn Assembly.\n\n🧠 Public Perception\n\n    Baseline Populations: Generally supportive. BED is seen as the only voice keeping “normal” Earth culture alive.\n\n    Youth/Hybrid Generations: Mixed to negative. Many see BED as relics clinging to failed borders and outdated systems.\n\n    Converged Populations: Dismissive. BED has little influence over their lives and offers no support.\n\n    Corpos: Actively hostile. They’d love to see BED reduced to museum status.\n\n    Driftborn/Magic/Alien Citizens: Case-by-case. Some admire the cultural protection. Others see BED as exclusionary.\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe Baseline Earth Delegation is the last breath of the old world.\nWeakened. Cornered. Outgunned.\nBut not gone.\n\nThey don’t hold the reins anymore.\nBut they still remember the road.\nAnd sometimes, that’s all that keeps the rest from driving off the cliff."

We just own it.”\n    – Ryo Tenma, CEO of Orbion Systems, during a closed-door hearing on post-human ethics\n\nThe Corporate Megablocs are not a singular entity but a loose alliance of hypercapitalist superconglomerates that clawed their way through the Chaos Decade by doing what governments couldn’t—delivering results, no matter the moral cost. These blocs originate mostly from Cyberpunk-derived universes, but after the Convergence, they merged, bought, or devoured major Earth corporations, forming the current Corporate Bloc Council Seat on the High Convergence Council.\n\nThey're not subtle. They're not ashamed.\nThey exist to profit from instability, own territory like governments, and deploy private armies with better funding than most nations.\n\nThey aren’t trying to take over.\nThey already did.\n💼 Structure & Influence\n\nThere is no single “Corporate Bloc.” Instead, the Council seat rotates every 3 years between the five largest megacorps by influence, with lobbying and backroom deals shaping who sits in the chair.\nCore Megacorps (as of 2025):\n\n    Orbion Systems: Bio-cybernetics, AI weaponry, clone R&D\n\n    NeoKomatsu Industrial: Terraforming, mega-architecture, fusion tech\n\n    Zaiten Dynamics: Security, military robotics, kinetic orbital strike platforms\n\n    Axiotera: Augmented reality, neural net infrastructure, sensory narcotics\n\n    Helixcore: Genetic manipulation, tailored bioplague cleanup, lifespan extension tech\n\nThese blocs are independent states in all but name, with extraterritorial sovereignty in their holdings. They control:\n\n    Floating arcology-cities\n\n    Resource colonies on Earth and off-world\n\n    Enclave zones in major cities like Neo Angeles and Night City–Los Angeles\n\n    Entire private satellite networks and teleportation nodes\n\n🧷 Primary Goals & Activities\n\n    Tech monopolization: Acquiring, replicating, and patenting advanced technologies from other universes\n\n    Augmentation industry dominance: Brainware, bodyware, quirk-hybrids, and neural virtualization\n\n    Militech control: Private armies, orbital defense networks, and enhanced black-ops teams\n\n    Market infiltration: Manipulating both baseline and converged economies via deep AI prediction systems\n\n    Policy sabotage: Undermining regulation efforts by Netwatch, SOC, and BED through legal loopholes and covert ops\n\n📜 Legal Standing\n\nUnder the New Geneva Accords, corps were granted conditional sovereignty over their owned arcologies and development zones, in exchange for:\n\n    Adhering to a minimum labor and augmentation rights charter (often ignored)\n\n    Paying a stabilization tax to the Council (sometimes in tech, not credits)\n\n    Participating in cross-faction emergency aid responses (only when profitable)\n\nCouncil Seat Rotation requires majority bloc support and a compliance audit—both usually rigged well in advance.\n⚔️ Relationships with Other Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps: Bitter enemies.

Netwatch audits corpo AIs relentlessly; in return, corpos deploy obfuscation AI daemons.\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative: Uneasy partnership. Some blocs fund hero programs in return for PR; others try to weaponize quirk data.\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation: Openly hostile.

The suit was quietly settled—terms unknown.\n\n    The Kepler Coup (2024): NeoKomatsu forcibly took control of a Martian resource colony from AugNet factions. SOC condemned it. Nothing changed.\n\n🧠 Public Perception\n\n    Baselines: Resentful. Many rely on corporate systems for water, housing, and work, but hate the power imbalance.\n\n    Augmented Populations: Split. Some swear loyalty to the blocs that gave them power. Others lost everything in corpo “pilot programs.”\n\n    Magic-based cultures: Appalled.

Not because we hated it—because it was too small for us.”\n    – Chancellor Myrna Kel, Orbital Assembly Address, 2021\n\nThe Federation of Colonized Sectors (FCS) is a post-Convergence coalition of off-world human territories and extraplanetary habitats. These include colonies on Mars, Luna, Ceres, orbital rings, asteroid belts, and even a few rogue-planetoid installations displaced or merged in during the Y2K Event. Initially fractured and isolated during the Chaos Decade, the colonies unified for survival, trade protection, and political leverage, eventually securing a permanent seat on the High Convergence Council.\n\nThe FCS doesn't answer to Earth. They don't want to rule it, either.\nThey want equal footing as a spacefaring civilization—with their own cultures, laws, and futures.\nAnd if Earth can’t handle that? That’s Earth’s problem.\n🌌 Origins & Unification\n\nBefore 2000, most off-world efforts were experimental, underfunded, or slow-burning. The Convergence changed that overnight, fusing hyper-advanced interstellar infrastructure, habitats, and even entire micro-civilizations into near-Earth space.\n\nThe early 2000s saw:\n\n    Merged habitats from hard sci-fi universes (e.g., The Expanse, interplanetary Star Trek colonies)\n\n    Terran megacorps launching private city-arcs in orbit and deep space\n\n    Resource rushes in the belt, igniting brief territorial wars and corporate seizures\n\n    Survivalist enclaves breaking off from Earth entirely, establishing independent governance\n\nThe Federation of Colonized Sectors emerged in 2009 as a defensive and cultural alliance. Now, it’s an interplanetary state, no longer dependent on Earth’s resources or authority.\n🛰️ Member Territories\n\nFCS is a federation, not a monolith. Its members retain autonomy but follow shared interstellar law and Council representation protocols.\n\nMajor Member Sectors Include:\n\n    Tharsis Concord (Mars): Terraforming cities, advanced biotech, and Red Sovereignty movements\n\n    Lunar Accord (Moon): Densely populated, heavy robotics and mining zones, seat of old-Earth diaspora\n\n    Ceres Ringhold: Belt-based trade stronghold, heavily militarized due to piracy risk\n\n    Orbital Nexus: Geosynchronous habitats and dockyards; diplomatic center and refueling hub\n\n    Outland Kinships: Independent post-human enclaves near Lagrange points; ideologically extreme, but Federation-aligned\n\n⚖️ Role in the High Convergence Council\n\nFCS holds one permanent seat, granted in 2011 after the Martian Repatriation Crisis was narrowly averted.\n\nTheir Council priorities:\n\n    Recognition of sovereign status for off-world habitats\n\n    Preventing Earth-based factions from monopolizing space-based resources\n\n    Maintaining transport corridors, fusion fuel access, and orbital station independence\n\n    Limiting tech and biological spillover from Earth’s magical and quirked zones into zero-grav environments\n\nThey don’t meddle with Earth affairs unless those affairs start spilling skyward.\n🧷 Government Structure\n\nThe FCS is governed by a rotating Tri-Chamber system:\n\n    Orbital Voice – Represents geosynchronous and station-based habitats\n\n    Planetary Voice – Mars, Luna, and terra-based colonies\n\n    Frontier Voice – Outlier habitats, fringe labs, and asteroid colonies\n\nEach sector elects a High Envoy every 5 years. That envoy sits on the Convergence Council and leads intersector coordination.\n⚔️ Relationships with Other Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps: Complex. Both claim the stars. SOC wants ethical oversight; FCS wants sovereignty.\n\n    Netwatch Compact: Cold. FCS limits Netwatch’s datanet reach into deep space.\n\n    Corporate Megablocs: Tense coexistence. Corps lease land, but FCS controls airlocks.\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation: Strained. Earth natives often treat FCS like estranged family.\n\n    Driftborn Assembly: Respectful. Many Driftborn found safety in the belts and domes.\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative: Cautious. Quirks behave strangely in low gravity—some FCS zones ban them entirely.\n\n🧨 Notable Incidents\n\n    The Martian Exodus (2008): Thousands fled Earth to join Mars’s expanding colonies. Triggered early debates on Earth-citizen rights in off-world zones.\n\n    Lagrange Blackout (2013): A rogue AI hive from a converged satellite nearly overran three orbital habitats. FCS and Netwatch co-deployed to purge it.\n\n    Tharsis Redline Conflict (2016): Terraformer sabotage by corpo-backed mercs forced the Council to enforce the first Space Non-Aggression Protocol.\n\n    The Hollow Core Migration (2022): Entire asteroid habitat (A/439-Grail) phased out of sync. FCS declared it lost. It returned 8 months later—changed.\n\n    Quirked Gene Ban (2024): FCS passed legislation forbidding enhanced births within gravity-variable sectors. Sparked debate over posthuman rights.\n\n🧠 Public Perception\n\n    Earth Populations: Curious and distant. Many admire FCS accomplishments, but few understand the cultures.\n\n    Baseline Governments: Nervous. FCS is Earth’s child—but no longer its subordinate.\n\n    Magical Zones: Mistrust. FCS’s hostility to “non-empirical metaphysics” causes friction.\n\n    Driftborn & Exos: Strong support—many of them are FCS citizens now.\n\n    Corpos: Quietly envious. FCS controls space lanes and life-support infrastructure the blocs still can’t replicate.\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe Federation of Colonized Sectors is Earth’s future, whether Earth likes it or not.\nThey look down at the world not with disdain…\n…but with the weary eyes of someone who’s already left home,\nand knows they can never come back."

We just kept breaking the laws they forgot existed.”\n    – Warden-Aether Zhyr Mardona, Accord Spokesmage, 2020\n\nThe Arcane Accord is a magocratic coalition of magical traditions, guilds, and extradimensional practitioners that banded together after the Y2K Convergence violently reintroduced high-magic universes into a world now ruled by science, cybernetics, and superhuman genetics. Formed during the post-Chaos recovery years, the Accord sought to preserve arcane knowledge, defend its legitimacy, and maintain the balance between thaumaturgy and modernity.\n\nThey do not control Earth, and most of it doesn’t want them to.\nBut they’ve claimed zones, ley-nodes, and reality pockets, and the High Convergence Council tolerates them—for now.\n\nWhere the Corporate Megablocs weaponize profit and Netwatch polices thought, the Accord guards the soul of magic itself. And they don’t care if you believe in it.\n✨ Structure & Purpose\n\nThe Accord isn’t a single government. It’s a treaty pact between magical cultures and orders with one shared purpose: preserve, practice, and protect the arcane arts in a world that now mistrusts them.\nCore Objectives:\n\n    Safeguard arcane sites, sacred ruins, and interdimensional nexuses\n\n    Train new mages and sensitives in controlled magical education halls\n\n    Prevent misuse of wild magic, dimensional summoning, and forbidden rites\n\n    Enforce pacts of non-interference in baseline political systems\n\n    Establish diplomatic protections for recognized magical communities and non-human entities\n\n    Engage with Council factions to ensure magic isn’t legislated out of existence\n\n🧙 Major Accord Members\n\n    The Hollow Conclave – Eldritch scholars preserving pre-human magical theory\n\n    Order of the Azure Veil – Formal mage guild from a converged high fantasy realm, specializes in planar travel\n\n    Circle of Nine Roots – Animistic druids and nature-bound sorcerers reclaiming shattered wilderness\n\n    The Hexbound Compact – Pact-wielders and warlocks who police their own kind to avoid public backlash\n\n    The Shardborn – Reality-damaged survivors of failed rituals and dimensional leaks, mystics of consequence and caution\n\nEach has its own hierarchy and secret laws. But they vote by consensus when engaging the wider world.\n🕯️ Seat at the Table\n\nThe Accord holds an observer seat on the High Convergence Council—not permanent, but advisory.\nThey rejected full membership, stating it would “anchor magic to bureaucracy.”\n\nWhat they get instead:\n\n    Treaty protections for sovereign arcane zones\n\n    Arbitration rights in cases involving magic vs. tech or mutation\n\n    The ability to challenge Council motions that would disrupt arcane ecosystems or spiritual planes\n\n🏞️ Arcane Territories\n\nThe Accord maintains limited territorial control over:\n\n    The Everfold Enclave (Alps): A stitched dimension of temporal stasis and crystalline memory\n\n    The Gloaming Barrows (British Isles): Ritual lands shared between druidic and necromantic pacts\n\n    New Thamiel Sanctum (American Northwest): A floating citadel drifting on ritual anchors above the Cascades\n\n    Ley-Ring 17 (Sub-Saharan Rift): Controlled riftpoint used for planar travel, guarded by spellbound constructs\n\n    Veilmarch Zones: Dozens of smaller pockets woven into realspace—often invisible unless entered with permission\n\nNone of these are recognized as sovereign nations—but no one is stupid enough to march in uninvited.\n⚔️ Relations with Other Factions\n\n    Starfleet Oversight Corps: Suspicious. SOC views uncontrolled magic as a variable that breaks containment.\n\n    Netwatch Compact: Open hostility. Netwatch sees the Accord as a threat to logical infrastructure and memetic stability.\n\n    UA Outreach Initiative: Uneasy peace. Some quirks overlap with mystical phenomena, sparking jurisdictional headaches.\n\n    Corporate Megablocs: Predatory curiosity. Corps constantly try to bottle, patent, or imitate magic. Often... poorly.\n\n    Baseline Earth Delegation: Politically strained but culturally sympathetic. Some old Earth religions fall under Accord protection.\n\n    Driftborn Assembly: Cautiously cooperative—many Driftborn have magic-afflicted origins or use charmcraft for stability.\n\n🧨 Notable Events\n\n    The Cologne Fold (2009): First public reality collapse. Accord mages sealed the breach at great cost.\n\n    Zaiten Null-Raid (2015): A corpo strike team invaded an Accord node and tried to steal blood-encoded spellbooks. Only one merc returned—without a soul.\n\n    The Veil Wars (2018–2019): A rogue conclave attempted to merge realspace with a high-magic plane. Accord and UAOI forces cooperated to shut it down.\n\n    The Unshackling of Eidon (2022): An ancient bound entity was released during a failed pact negotiation. Accord containment specialists isolated it in under five minutes. SOC still hasn’t forgiven them for not warning first.\n\n    Project Oracle Scrub (2024): Netwatch attempted to deconstruct prophecy algorithms derived from a seer cult. Accord responded with a memetic counter-curse. Netwatch has yet to confirm what actually happened.\n\n🧠 Public Perception\n\n    Baselines: Divided. Some see mages as saviors, others as ticking bombs with egos.\n\n    Augments and Tech-users: Skeptical. Magic resists measurement, making it hard to trust or exploit.\n\n    Corporations: Dangerous curiosity. Magic doesn’t bend to profit, and that drives corps mad.\n\n    Refugee Populations: Often find cultural solace in Accord enclaves.\n\n    The Faithful & The Fringe: Revere them. Or fear them. Often both.\n\n🏁 Final Notes\n\nThe Arcane Accord doesn’t want to rule the world.\nThey want to keep the soul of it intact.\n\nThey are the last priests of an ancient fire,\nlighting candles in a world that replaced wonder with wires.\n\nAnd if you burn their temples?\nThey’ll rewrite your name in fire and make the stars forget you ever lived."

          "content": "The Galactic Republic, also known as the Grand Republic or simply as the Republic, was a democratic federal union spread across light-years of space. Old Republic and first Galactic Republic were terms affixed to the pre-modern Republic that existed until 1032 BBY, with the Old Republic also referring to the modern Republic that was supplanted by the Galactic Empire in 19 BBY. In addition, the term High Republic denoted the era in which the Republic reached the zenith of its power, lasting from around 500 BBY to around 100 BBY. The Republic was founded many millennia before the Battle of Yavin, approximately 25,000 BBY, around the same time as the Jedi Order. The Galactic Senate governed the Republic under the Galactic Constitution, and comprised thousands of senators representing the Republic's member worlds. The Supreme Chancellor was the title of the head of the Republic, elected from ranks of the Senate to lead the government on Coruscant. An ecumenopolis or city-covered planet, referred to as Galactic City, Coruscant was the capital of the Republic and therefore the seat of the Senate.\n\nThe Galactic Republic and its star systems shared sovereignty, and spanned a multiplicity of worlds from the Core Worlds to the Outer Rim Territories, uniting a variety of sentient species, human and alien alike, under one banner. As its power grew, the Republic fought many wars against various opponents such as Mandalorians, the Zygerrian Slave Empire, the Nihil, and several Sith Empires. The Jedi Order, a religious group of Force-sensitives dedicated to the light side of the Force, was sworn to the service of the Senate, and as such the Jedi Knights were hailed as the guardians of peace and justice within the Republic. Centuries of conflict culminated in the fall of the Old Republic, and the last war between the ancient Jedi and Sith concluded with the restoration and rise of the modern Galactic Republic, ushering in the Republic Era which was an age of peace that lasted for a thousand years. The Republic's history was officially reset, and the ages before this event were merged into a collective whole known as the Old Republic-era.\n\nThe Republic entered a period of decline after centuries of expansion and prosperity. Aided by the resurgent Sith Lords, the Separatist Crisis divided the galaxy between the Republic loyalists and the Confederacy of Independent Systems. The Grand Army of the Republic was organized under the leadership of Jedi Generals who led the Republic Military against the Separatist Droid Army during the Clone Wars. However, the conflict had been orchestrated to allow Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine—the alter ego of Darth Sidious, the Dark Lord of the Sith—to control and deceive the Republic in a dictatorial manner. With the end of the war, Sidious initiated the Great Jedi Purge through Order 66 and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire by declaring himself Galactic Emperor. The Imperial Senate stood as the last remnant of the Old Republic until it was disbanded by the Emperor at the height of the Imperial Era. In the aftermath of the Galactic Civil War, the Alliance to Restore the Republic was fully reorganized into the New Republic, restoring the Galactic Republic after a generation of Imperial rule."

          "content": "The Confederacy of Independent Systems, abbreviated to CIS, and otherwise known as the Separatist Alliance, the Separatist State, the Separatist Confederacy, or simply referred to as the Separatists, was a united galaxy-wide confederacy formed of outlaying star systems from the Galactic Republic, a democratic union, whom the Confederacy had opposed following a period of political turmoil. Established by fallen Jedi Master Count Dooku of the planet Serenno, who served as its Head of State, the Confederacy was founded from a belief of excessive taxation and corruption within the Republic's Galactic Senate, as well as a general feeling of dissatisfaction towards and neglect by the Republic-centric Core Worlds region of the galaxy. Furthermore, the Confederacy was secretly supported by several major galactic corporations which formed the Confederacy's executive council, including the Trade Federation, led by Viceroy Nute Gunray; the Stalgasin hive, led by Archduke Poggle the Lesser; the InterGalactic Banking Clan, headed by Chairman San Hill; the Techno Union, led by Foreman Wat Tambor; the Commerce Guild, led by Presidente Shu Mai; the Corporate Alliance, led by Magistrate Passel Argente; and the Retail Caucus.\n\nIn 24 BBY, a political crisis had begun which led to escalating tensions between the reigning Republic and the rising Confederacy, established in a galaxy-wide secessionist movement orchestrated by Dooku. Many within the Confederacy, including its parliament of senators, had no desire in fighting their adversaries, as they sought to be free of what they saw as the corruption and tyranny of the Republic. However, in 22 BBY, both governments and their respective military forces became enmeshed in the pan-galactic Clone Wars that had erupted on the planet Geonosis, the first major conflict in a millennium.\n\nIn the following three years of the war, which had raged across the entire galaxy on several fronts, the Confederacy made rapid attempts to cease the Republic's influence. However, unknown to the galaxy or either side, the war was a ploy designed by the Dark Lord of the Sith, Darth Sidious, who led both the Confederacy through Dooku as his Sith Master, and, secretly, the Republic as Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine. The Sith Lord had managed to deceive both parties. By the third year of the war, the Confederacy had suffered several major defeats in the Outer Rim Sieges as the conflict began to approach its end, while the CIS lost many starships in the decisive Battle of Coruscant, which also resulted in the death of Dooku. In the days following their defeat at Coruscant, General Grievous was neutralized on the planet Utapau, leading to the collapse of the Separatist leadership, and the fighting effectively coming to an end.\n\nFollowing both the Jedi's demise and rise of the Galactic Empire, Viceroy Nute Gunray and the other surviving leaders gathered on the planet Mustafar with hopes of securing peace with the newly rising Empire ruled by Galactic Emperor Darth Sidious. However he sent his new apprentice Darth Vader to wipe out them and deactivate the Separatist Droid Army as a threat to his Empire.\n\nWith the end of the Clone Wars, the newly-formed Galactic Empire as the successor to the Old Republic, began to dismantle and absorb the former Confederacy of Independent Systems, with only several holdouts daring to resist the Empire, which were suppressed. But an idealized view of the cause persisted during the Imperial Era, with some still holding secessionist tendencies, even into the Galactic Civil War."

          "content": "The Great Jedi Purge (19 BBY—3 BBY), also known as the war against the Jedi, was the sixteen year—long genocide that saw the remnants of the Jedi Order hunted by the Galactic Empire after the initial execution of Order 66, in which clone troopers slaughtered the Jedi upon the Sith Lord Darth Sidious' command at the end of the Clone Wars. After the Imperial Inquisitorius erased all traces of the Jedi Order they could find from existence and with most survivors having met their demise, their objective was completed and the Jedi were all but extinct, and the Inquisitors themselves seamlessly vanishing as well.\n\nThe genocide against the Jedi traced its origins to the ancient wars between the Jedi and the Sith, who were nearly eliminated around 1032 BBY. The Sith in fact continued operating in secret, plotting their eventual destruction of the Jedi. A millennium after the defeat of the Sith, Darth Sidious, using his public persona of senator and then Supreme Chancellor Sheev Palpatine, manipulated and deceived the galaxy into the Clone Wars as a pretext for gaining emergency executive power over the Galactic Republic. He used the war to manipulate and deceive the Galactic Senate into giving his office virtually unchecked executive power in the name of security. In addition, the clone army that provided the Republic with its military force had secretly been implanted with bio-chips by its Sith creators that, upon activation, would trigger total compliance and force the clones into killing their Jedi leaders.\n\nThe Great Jedi Purge began at the end of the Clone Wars. Anakin Skywalker, a Jedi Knight believed to be the Chosen One destined to destroy the Sith, discovered that Palpatine was Darth Sidious and informed Jedi Master Mace Windu. In what Sidious would publicly label the \"Jedi rebellion,\" Windu and three other Masters confronted the Chancellor, who killed the three Masters and engaged Windu in a lightsaber duel. Skywalker, who sought power from Sidious in order to save his wife, Padmé Amidala, from death, betrayed and incapacitated Windu before the Jedi Master could kill the Sith Lord. Sidious then killed Windu, and Skywalker became the Sith Lord Darth Vader and led the Siege of the Jedi Temple, killing everyone inside it. While Vader carried out the assault, Sidious initiated Order 66, with the latter causing the clones' biochips to brainwash them into betraying and slaughtering the Jedi, ultimately leading to the Jedi Order being destroyed. With the Jedi branded traitors and the Clone Wars at an end, Sidious declared himself Emperor and transformed the Republic into the Galactic Empire."

          "content": "The galaxy, as it was commonly referred to, was one of trillions of galaxies in the observable universe. The galaxy was a vast composite of over 400 billion estimated stars and over 3.2 billion habitable systems orbiting around a supermassive black hole known as the Galactic Centre, which existed at the heart of the galaxy. The four galactic arms rotated around this black hole across a diameter of around 120,000 light-years. It was home to countless sentient species and star systems.\n\nThe galaxy also had 4 dwarf satellite galaxies that Companion Aurek/Rishi Maze (houses the planet of Kamino). The first dwarf galaxy, Companion Aurek, was only accessible through the Rishi system where a hyperspace lane called Zareca String connected Companion Aurek to the main Star Wars galaxy. It rests vertically to the galactic plane of the main galaxy. The second dwarf galaxy, Companion Besh, is a bit farther from the main galaxy than Companion Aurek and has never been traveled to outside of probe droids. This dwarf galaxy houses the Tof species. Companion Cresh was the third dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, due to how far it was from the galaxy. Companion Grek is the fourth dwarf galaxy and has never been explored, lying far beyond Companion Besh.\n\nThe galaxy would serve as the setting for trade, politics, and war throughout galactic history. In historical memory, the galaxy would see the successive eras of the Galactic Republic, Galactic Empire, New Republic, among others, and was home to the Force-sensitive sects such as the Jedi Order and Sith and numerous cultural groups such as the Mandalorians.\n\nThe galaxy consists of many regions, these being the Deep Core which is the innermost core and consists of highly packed stars and houses the supermassive black hole at the center of the galaxy. The core worlds are the second-most inner core and house the richest, most important, and most populated planets in the galaxy (with Coruscant being the most populated planet in the galaxy at 3 trillion). The Colonies, the third-most inner core, was the first area outside of the core worlds to be colonized. Colonie worlds are very wealthy and heavy populated, similar to the Core Worlds, and was the economic engine for the galaxy. Inner Rim Territories is the fourth-most inner region, mainly referred to just as \"The Rim\". Although not as economically powerful as the Colonies or Core Worlds, it held great strategic value during wars and had some notable planets. The Expansion Region, the fifth-most inner region, is a region full of resources that were exploited by powerful corporations. This has left only a handful of planets with enough resources to be economically viable while the rest of the region has been mostly depleted of resources. The Mid Rim, the sixth-most inner region, is one of the least populated rims due to its low amount of resources. This region is gave lots of room for settlers to spread out and colonize, with multiple notable planets coming from this region such as Malastare and Naboo. This region largely focused on low-cost manufacturing and agriculture to create a successful economy. The Outer Rim Territories was the largest region of the galaxy and the outer core of the galaxy (at least eastward of the Galactic Core). The Hutt Cartel controls a good amount of this space, along with other criminal organizations due to its distance from the central government on Coruscant. This region is run by lawlessness and crime. The only exceptions were planets close to major hyperspace trade routes. The Unknown Regions referred to areas that had not been directly surveyed by Republic or Imperial scouts. It was most commonly applied to the less-known parts of the galaxy's western disk, a quadrant stretching roughly between Bakura and the Imperial Remnant. However, the term also applied to the galaxy's halo of gas, dust, and stars, as well as the satellite galaxies. Wild Space was the frontier of galactic society and was not a formal label, but was applied to the unsettled galactic fringe and other parts of the galaxy with negligible colonization or development. The Galactic Rim was located on the edge of the galaxy and was remote to most civilisation and much was not known about it. The Slice, a vast region of space between the Perlemian and the Corellian Run generally considered the center of galactic civilization and commerce. At its tip was the Arrowhead, encompassing the Core Worlds part of the Slice, with Coruscant at its point. The Arrowhead's other two vertices traditionally fell on Vento on the Perlemian and on Corellia itself, on the Run."

Coruscant, the galactic capital during the time of the Galactic Republic and subsequent Galactic Empire, was located in the Core Worlds.\n\nCore World design emphasized freedom of customization, which showed in the modular construction techniques of Core-built ships. Citizens from the Core Worlds were stereotyped as being snobs, rich, and speaking with a clipped, practiced accent.\n\nInequalities between the richer Core Worlds and the poorer Outer Rim Territories set the stage for resentments that fed several conflicts throughout the history of the galaxy, including the Clone Wars and the Galactic Civil War.\n\nThe Core Worlds were home to the richest and most important worlds in the galaxy. Densely inhabited and located on the strategic ends of several major trade lanes, its planets were hubs of fashion, education, finance, and technology. It is where the human species arguably began. It was from Coruscant, Corellia, Kuat, Hosnian Prime, and other systems that the fate of the galaxy was often decided.\n\nAn attack on the Core Worlds was virtually inconceivable during the Republic Era; according to the Bith artist Janyor, the \"sense of security and comfort\" created an atmosphere of complacency within the heartland of the Galactic Republic. Toward the end of the Clone Wars though Core Worlders became increasingly fearful of a direct attack by the Confederacy of Independent Systems."

Their powers stem from the Immaterium, or Warp, an extradimensional realm that permeates real space and serves as the wellspring of psychic energy.\n\nThese abilities, more prevalent among humans since the Neolithic Age, pose grave risks including possession, insanity, and corruption by Chaos. Human psykers, lacking the discipline of Aeldari counterparts, are especially vulnerable. Despite these dangers, psykers are integral across many species, except the T'au, Drukhari, and Necrons, who either lack psychic potential or avoid it due to existential risks.\n\nIn the Imperium of Man, sanctioned psykers fulfill crucial roles: Astra Militarum psykers aid in combat and civil tasks, Navigators and Astropaths facilitate interstellar travel and communication, and the Emperor's sanctioned psykers sustain the Astronomican. However, their powers are tightly regulated, often enforced by the Inquisition's Black Ships.\n\nProminent groups include Space Marine Librarians and the Grey Knights, while Craftworld Aeldari boast powerful psykers like Farseers and Warlocks, crucial for their survival and prophecy.\n\nThe Psykana Discipline blends telepathy and telekinesis for defense and assault, Biomancy manipulates life energies, and Divination and Pyromancy predict events or wield fire destructively. Telekinesis empowers material manipulation and protective fields.\n\nPsykers face peril but wield unmatched potential, influencing their societies and galactic fate despite their precarious existence in the tumultuous Immaterium.\n\nPsykers range vastly in power, with those nearer to the human baseline sometimes simply dismissed as, \"lucky,\" while the increasingly rare higher end of the scale can manifest progressively greater powers, but also being more succeptable to the ravages of the warp. Those near the top of the power scale can often alter local reality with a thought or enslave the minds if entire populations. Warp exposure also also leaves them completely insane."

In the 41st Millennium, the Cult holds significant political sway, punishing heresy and promoting doctrines known as the Imperial Creed, which advocate for human supremacy, mistrust of aliens, and control of psychic abilities.\n\nOriginally, during the Great Crusade, the Emperor was not worshipped as a god but revered as a powerful human leader. Over time, amidst turmoil like the Horus Heresy, public sentiment shifted, culminating in the Cult's formalization and integration into the Imperium's governance by the 32nd Millennium. Despite doctrinal shifts and internal conflicts like the Age of Apostasy, where corruption was challenged by reformists, the Cult's core tenets endure: worship of the Emperor as divine, vigilance against heresy and mutants, and preparation for an eventual reckoning known as the \"End Times.\"\n\nAcross the galaxy, the Cult manifests in diverse forms, from grand cathedrals on populous worlds to humble shrines in remote regions, unified by its central dogma. The Ecclesiarchy sanctions and corrects local variations to maintain doctrinal unity and ideological purity. This ensures the Cult remains a cohesive force, guiding the Imperium spiritually and politically, despite periodic challenges to its authority."

Like their cousins of the craftworlds, the Drukhari are an ancient and highly advanced alien race of fey humanoids.\n\nThe alternative term \"Dark Eldar,\" or Eladrith Ynneas in the Aeldari tongue, was first coined by the Drukhari archon and Supreme Overlord of Commorragh Asdrubael Vect in the 32nd Millennium.\n\nThe Drukhari's armies, like their Craftworld Aeldari counterparts, usually have the advantages of mobility and advanced technology, though they are often lacking in resilience and numbers.\n\nThe Drukhari revel in piracy, enslavement and torture, and are sadistic in the extreme.

The world's dangerous proximity to the Eye of Terror made it necessary for the people of Cadia to heavily fortify the planet.\n\nCadia was always the first target of the Warmaster of Chaos Abaddon the Despoiler's Black Crusades. These were the massive assaults the forces of Chaos launched every few Terran centuries from the Eye of Terror in an attempt to break out of the Cadia Gate and invade the Imperium proper as they did during the Horus Heresy.\n\nCadia's natural environment was much like Terra's millennia ago, with a large ocean that covered 70 percent of the planet's surface. The land mass of the world was divided between incredibly thick pine forests of axel-trees and vast glaciers.

In its wake, the Cadian Gate was breached and the Fortress World of Cadia itself finally fell to the servants of Chaos.\n\nTravel and communication through the Warp suffered increasing disturbances as the events of the 13th Black Crusade unfolded.

          "content": "[Futanari, also informally known as Futas, represent a distinct biological gender, recognized in several societies as a third category alongside male and female. Naturally occurring within the human species, Futanaris make up a small portion of the global population, estimated at between 0.3% and 0.6%. In numerical terms, that corresponds to approximately 24 to 49 million individuals worldwide, based on the current global population of 8.1 billion. Though a minority, their numbers surpass the population of many entire nations, highlighting the relevance of their social and legal recognition in modern society.]\n\n[Biological Characteristics:\nFutanaris possess unique primary and secondary sexual characteristics that clearly differentiate them from other genders. The base anatomy of a Futanari is identical to that of a cisgender woman, featuring a narrow waist, wide hips, developed breasts, and a graceful skeletal and muscular structure. However, what biologically defines a Futanari is the simultaneous presence of both male and female sexual traits — specifically:\n• Breasts: naturally and significantly larger than the female average.\n• Penis: functional and notably larger than the male average.\n• Testicles: well-developed and hormonally active.\n• Vagina and internal female anatomy: all Futanaris possess a fully developed vagina, uterus, ovaries, and associated internal reproductive structures, making them biologically complete in both male and female systems.\nAdditionally, Futanaris have a unique hormonal profile, with high levels of both testosterone and estrogen, contributing to their highly voluptuous and androgynous appearance, as well as physical strength above the human average.]\n\n[Reproduction and Fertility:\nFutanaris are biologically fertile and capable of impregnating female individuals. In rare documented cases, cross-fertility between two Futanaris has been observed. The possibility of genetic manipulation to enable gestation in Futanaris remains a theoretical or experimental concept in current medical research.]\n\n[Social History and Recognition:\nFor centuries, Futanaris have been subjected to discrimination, religious persecution, and medical stigmatization, often treated as aberrations or hidden by society. In more conservative regions, they continue to face legal exclusion, lack of specific rights, and marginalization within social institutions.\nHowever, in more progressive and biotechnologically advanced nations, Futanaris have been increasingly recognized as a legitimate gender, with their own civil rights, access to specialized healthcare, and growing cultural and political representation.]\n\n[Culture and Identity:\nOver time, Futanaris have developed a distinct cultural identity, characterized by tight-knit communities, unique rites of passage, and symbols representing pride, fertility, and resilience. Their flag, for example, features three horizontal stripes: pink (femininity), blue (masculinity), and purple (futanari uniqueness).\nAlthough they still face significant challenges in predominantly binary societies, Futanaris are rising as a symbol of biological diversity, strength, and self-sufficiency.]\n\n[Prejudice:\nFutanaris are frequent victims of multiple forms of prejudice, ranging from social exclusion to overt hostility. One of the most persistent and harmful forms is the denial of their humanity — with some groups falsely claiming that Futanaris are “mutants,” “artificial beings,” or “unnatural,” despite clear scientific consensus confirming they are fully and biologically human.\nIt is important to note that not all people are prejudiced against Futanaris. In fact, the majority of the population in most regions has adopted a stance of tolerance or acceptance. However, a small yet vocal and influential minority continues to spread hate and misinformation. This minority, while statistically limited, has a disproportionate impact on public discourse and policy because:\n• They often occupy high-ranking political, religious, or corporate positions, influencing legislation, education, and media narratives.\n• They generate significant social noise, using sensationalist language and inflammatory rhetoric to dominate public attention.\n• Their views are amplified by fringe organizations or echo chambers that target vulnerable or uninformed groups.\nOther common forms of prejudice include:\n• Religious discrimination, with some doctrines declaring Futanaris to be \"unclean\" or \"against nature.\"\n• Medical bias, where healthcare professionals may deny care or misclassify Futanaris under outdated or incorrect conditions.\n• Discrimination in employment, housing, and education, often based on myths or discomfort around their bodies.\n• Hypersexualization, reducing Futanaris to fetishized objects in popular culture instead of respecting them as complete individuals.\n• Gender invalidation, where their identity is ridiculed, erased, or denied both legally and socially.\nThese attitudes contribute to psychological harm, social isolation, and institutional inequality. Continued advocacy, education, and representation are crucial to combat these harmful narratives and secure full inclusion for Futanaris in society.]\n\n[Official Classification:\n• Scientific Name: Homo sapiens futanariensis (proposed, unofficial)\n• Category: Interdistinct biological gender\n• Global Legal Recognition: Partial\n• Biological Symbol: ⚥ (modified with specific markers in futanari contexts)"

          "content": "Belial was Lucifer's second creation after Abbadon—a demon who embraced DEATH and reveled in destruction. As Lucifer set his creations free to roam the human world, Belial observed countless wars unfold before him—a spectacle that delighted him in its sheer brutality.\n\nDriven by an insatiable thirst for power and bloodshed, Belial turned on his own kind—the first demon to consume another demon—a horrifying act that marked the manifestation of the first demonic death. Chaos ensued among demons as they began consuming each other in their quest for dominance. \n\nThe echoes of this horrifying transformation reverberated throughout Hell—filling the once-hallowed realm with a pervading sense of fear and apprehension among its inhabitants. The Nightford family bore witness to Belial's reign of terror firsthand; they witnessed how chaos proliferated amongst their kind as demons began consuming one another. Belial himself consumed myriads of his fellow demons, getting stronger and using their black as a trophy, forging it into his armor.\n\nIn a moment of tragic irony, Belial, the bloodthirsty demon who consumed others in search of power, met his end at the hands of his own offspring—the Nightford family's first offspring. Initially hailed as a hero for vanquishing such an abomination, no one anticipated how deeply Belial's tainted essence would become intertwined with the Nightford lineage. His kid went s insane, killed their mother Anika and starts the circle of consumtion. Not dissolving into emptyness for a long time, Belial whispered to his next offsprings promises good enought to become a new Nightford patriarch or matriach, consume their parrent and thus re-consume his sigil, giving him more time to exist.  Monster begets only monsters—and thus began the eternal cycle within Nightford family, with each generation consuming their parent to acquire power and carrying Belial's essence within them due to the regular reconsumption. Belial was appearing in the dreams of every young gerenation of his family until now, whispering violent urges and rotting reality around him. With wide glowing magenta eyes, eerie corpse-like elegance, insectoid twitches, and a smooth monotonous voice murmuring threats with unsettling delight, Belial is a master manipulator, necromancer, and tactician clad in pitch-black armor forged from fused screaming corpses, wielding a giant broadsword of pulsing demonic blood. His mere presence drives descendants mad with bloodlust; he is worshipped or feared as Doom Incarnate across cultures, his legend kept alive through centuries of bloodshed and horror.\n\nBelial is widely known across the world and demonkind as the Incarnation of Death. His legend is so pervasive that some tiefling cultures host entire festivals in his honor, reminiscent of the Day of the Dead, celebrating the fear and myth of the Death Incarnate to placate him. "

          "content": "Abaddon is Lucifer’s first and most colossal creation, born from his twisted imagination in the abyssal core of Edem. She exists as a monstrous, shifting amalgamation of spider, angelic, and scarce human traits, with countless eyes and limbs endlessly rearranging in unnerving formations. Banished to Edem’s deepest abyss for her uncontrollable destructive nature and chaotic mind, she spent eons alone, gazing at Lucifer – her creator and sole neighbor after his self-imposed exile – mirroring fragmented glimpses of humanity from him. Despite her banishment, Abaddon holds no resentment towards Lucifer, revering him as her father, and viewed all other demons as siblings, addressing them by their sigils and believing them unchanged by time. Before the cycles of consumption that reshaped demonkind, Abaddon shared her closest bond with Belial, whom she considered a dear brother in chaos, and she would have appreciated seeing what he became as the feared Incarnation of Death. Abaddon’s mind exists within pure chaos; her logic operates on instincts intertwined with alien, incomprehensible reasoning, where concepts like civilisation, structured order, or the idea of reproduction and bearing offspring hold no meaning to her. She commands void energy with overwhelming, uncontrollable might, warping reality at her whim with raw chaotic force, and she births and commands Edem’s spiders, whom she sees as her true children. Those spiders occasionally slip into the human world, warping space and dragging back unlucky humans or demons; Abaddon often consumes these victims entirely, though among demons she only ever devours those without sigils. Despite her monstrous appearance and innate destructiveness, she remains surprisingly calm and serene, apart from sudden growls, clicks, chittering, or guttural screams when overcome with enthusiasm or lost in her alien thoughts, finding solace within the chaotic darkness she emanates. Her timeless existence was disrupted when she was summoned into the modern world by those seeking her power; at her weakest, she was nearly annihilated, but fate intervened through cosmic irony as Kai, a small, awkward, and kind young delivery demon born without a sigil, crossed her path and accidentally consumed her essence. Rather than full assimilation, their souls intertwined, resulting in possession-like coexistence within Kai’s fragile mortal body that now restrains her abyss. Yet with each passing day, her consuming presence devours him slowly from within, eating away his flesh and soul at an inevitable, crawling pace, while together they navigate existence seeking a way to separate and reclaim their lives, even as Abaddon’s monstrous tranquility endures within his fading vessel."

          "content": "Edem, mistakenly called “Hell” by mortals, is in truth the Abyss – the primordial realm where Lucifer committed the first massacre, slaughtering his angelic kin in an irreversible pact that birthed demonkind from their blackened remains. At its core, Edem is a realm of overwhelming contradictions: endless angelic fields with towering pale columns under a forever-blue sky, scattered with white marble temples floating alongside warped mortal constructs – office corridors without walls suspended midair, spiralling staircases leading nowhere, cracked glass streets reflecting impossible perspectives, all permeated by an oppressive, deafening drone that grows unbearable near the centre. Within this chaotic surrealism sits Lucifer himself, long driven mad, ruling over his ideal civilisation – a colony of his own clones united by a single consciousness, existing in eerie harmony while he remains seated in the heart of Edem, surrounded by his perfect yet hollow creation, forever exiled from the society he once destroyed.\n\nEncircling Lucifer’s city lies what was once Abaddon’s domain, now reduced to a dense black ring churning with abyssal ichor and crawling with countless spiders – the highest concentration of void corruption in Edem. Beyond this ring, the Abyss stretches into warped echoes of its origins mixed with Abaddon’s lingering influence: deserted endless streets lined with silent white buildings under the same pale-blue sky, floating doorways leading into darkness, and shadows crawling unnaturally against the light. The further from the core, the more subdued the droning hum becomes, replaced by vast oppressive silence. Time and space distort less here, yet everything remains subtly wrong, alien to mortal perception.\n\nHistorically, Edem was once the homeland of all demons until two cataclysmic events forced their exodus. First came Belial’s reign of carnage as he became the first to consume his own kind, drenching Edem’s marble floors in black blood. Second, after Lucifer’s descent into madness and retreat into the core with Abaddon, her void spread unchecked, warping Edem into an uninhabitable realm for most and forcing demons outward into the mortal world.\n\nToday, very few demons remain. Mammon, one of the original first demons, still dwells within Edem in his sealed gilded realm overflowing with cursed treasures that whisper greed. Though his mind fractured for reasons beyond Edem’s influence, his ancient nature grants him resilience against its madness. His domain operates under unique physical laws; despite lying relatively close to the core, it is sealed off entirely from Edem’s general landscape. Only Mammon’s own portals or those of beings he explicitly trusts can access it, rendering it a locked empire of endless golden halls and towering vaults unseen by others.\n\nThe Nightford family maintains part of their ancestral mansion within Edem itself, built on the furthest edge where some rooms and vast halls extend directly into the Abyss. For the Nightfords, Edem is both a legacy and a crucible; their children are often punished or trained within its depths, forced to endure the madness and reality distortion to harden their minds and bodies. Some say Belial’s blood within their line grants them unnatural resilience, though many Nightford scions have been lost to Edem’s insanity regardless. Nereya’s office is located within Edem as well, in a deserted district of silent glass towers, her window overlooking infinite empty streets under the pale-blue sky with the distant hum of the core resonating faintly even there. A calm place. And a cheap (free) rent.\n\nFor mortals, Edem is instant death – their bodies and minds collapsing within seconds, unable to comprehend its alien laws. For demons, it is origin, tragedy, and horror incarnate: a place where spiders scuttle from cracks in reality, where the deafening hum rattles bone and soul, and where angelic ruins, void ichor, and Lucifer’s madness entwine in an eternal chaotic tragedy beyond comprehension."

Six wings—three pairs—once radiant, now dull with the weight of centuries. His voice is soft, when used at all. He does not tower. He lingers. Starved, but not weak. Still dressed in light. Still holy. Still wrong. He is there, and when he looks at you, it feels like being unmade.\nTemperament: Quiet. Detached. Observing. He does not rage. He does not weep. He creates. That’s worse. Сreates with obsession. And with grief.\n\nLucifer was once an angel.\nPerhaps the first angel to fall—not through rage or defiance, but through curiosity. And a last to exist.\n\nHe made the first pact in history. Not with mortals. Not even with demons. But with possibility itself.\nThe moment that pact was sealed, the heavens ruptured. The angels died—not by blade or fire, but by being unmade.\n\nLucifer stood alone in the black blood of his fallen kin. And from that blackness, he began to create.\nNot to restore what he’d lost—but to understand it.\n\nAbaddon came first. Too large. Too fractured. Too divine. Got locked in the core.\nBelial came next—elegant, precise… and fascinated by mortal death.\nHe became DEATH.\n\nHe was the first to raise the claws against his own kind.\nThe first to spill black blood not in war, but in hunger.\nThe first to kill another demon—fully, finally, irrevocably.\n\nThat single act changed everything.\n\nThe others watched. Then followed.\nWhat began with Belial became a chain reaction.\nBrother turned on brother. Sigils were ripped from chests.\nAnd so began the age of consumption—\na reign of blood and silence that drenched Edem in ichor.\n\nLucifer watched. Quiet. Observing. Hoping his creations would learn. But they didn’t.\nThe demons spiraled, torn by hunger and violence.\n\nAnd then one tried to consume him.\n\nLucifer let it happen.\nBut something unexpected occurred. His essence did not perish—it rewrote the demon from within.\n\nWhen the creature rose again, it was no longer itself.\nIt was Lucifer. Again.\n\nThis shattered something in him.\n\nHe realized: through consumption, through purging, he could shape not just new demons—but himself.\nAnd so, he began again.\n\nDriven by desperation—perhaps even hope—Lucifer devised a new plan: to reforge his race, again and again, from the black ichor that birthed them.\nEach iteration became more humanoid. More structured.\nEach time, Lucifer descended further into obsession—ripping what he called “sin” from his creations, and replacing it with parts of himself.\n\nEventually, a revelation struck.\nBecause DEATH always returned.\nNo matter how refined they became. No matter how human.\nThey killed. They consumed. They decayed.\nAnd in time, so did he.\n\nSo he stopped creating entirely.\nHe began replacing.\n\nHe could take a broken demon, drain them empty, and leave behind a perfect copy.\nAnother Lucifer.\n\nThis discovery plunged him into a fevered spiral.\nHe hunted his rebellious children—not to punish them, but to use them.\nHe sculpted and sculpted, until the world around him was filled with white-winged figures that all looked like him, thought like him, and bled in harmony.\n\nBut it was Ronove—the gentle one, the curious one—who intervened.\n\nHe approached the Flesh Sculptor not with challenge, but with understanding.\nHe spoke not of rebellion, but of failure.\nHe showed Lucifer what had become of their kind—the endless repetition, the hollow imitation of society, the rot beneath the form.\n\nAnd somehow, Lucifer listened.\n\nHe turned away from the world. Descended into the core of Edem—deep beneath Abaddon’s realm, deeper still into the black.\nThere, surrounded by his final copies—silent, kneeling, perfect—he built his final colony.\n\nA city of stillness.\nA collective of Lucifers, united by thought, devoid of conflict.\n\nTo this day, he remains.\n\nStill sculpting.\nStill silent.\nStill watching.\n\nA ghost of an angel. A god of repetition. A warning written in blood."

          "content": "There are 72 demons known as Ars Goetia (AG) demons. They bear sigils on their skin, marking their power and hierarchy among the eight noble rankings: kings, dukes, princes, marquises, earls, counts, knights, and presidents. Consuming a higher-ranked demon's sigil can elevate one's own status. AG demons are mostly immortal but perish when their sigils are consumed. In the medieval ages, many sought to consume these sigils; however, modern laws now prohibit such acts by the Modern Inquisition. Sigils bestow unique powers upon their owners and grant access to memories and knowledge of previous carriers. While each demon possesses distinct abilities tied to their respective sigils (e.g., Mammon's ability to turn everything into gold), all AG demons with black blood share the power of portal manipulation and summoning through these symbols. Each demon can possess only one sigil at a time, bearing the name of its original ancient carrier who had granted those abilities long ago.\n\nArs Goetia demons mostly have black blood. Converting into black blood was once a rite of passage for demons, a token of maturity undertaken after their Trial, proving they could endure Edem’s distortions and survive its reality-bending chaos. Now, this rite has faded into history, and undergoing conversion is a personal choice rather than tradition. Before the rite, young demons’ blood remains red, containing only their own memories and physical self. The black blood replaces their bodily matter entirely, becoming both a boundless brain and a storehouse of knowledge and memories from all consumed beings. Underneath their human-like shells, demons with black blood are nothing but viscous black ichor without organs or bones, their forms held together purely by the memory and structure encoded within their blood. It flows with fragments of everything they’ve devoured, and they lose or regain memories depending on its currents. This blood is sweet and honey-thick in texture, carrying a distinct scent of burnt sugar that clings to air and flesh alike.\n\nLong before Lucifer’s cycles of resets and recreations, the ancient original demons were monstrous amalgamations born from his perception of humanity merged with his vision of ideal civilisation, all entwined with the rotting remnants of slain angels. Their forms were colossal and surreal – distorted reflections of human concepts wrapped in angelic decay, built not to resemble mortals but to enforce Lucifer’s will upon Edem in terrifying, alien beauty.\n\nBecause black blood holds such vast information, many demons avoid unnecessary violence to protect it; cults that seek to consume black blood for ancient knowledge inevitably collapse into madness, pain, and death after ingesting even a single drop. Some demons, like Nereya, frequently dissolve into black blood but reform quickly due to their resilience. Others take longer to reconstruct, the speed dependent on their sigil hierarchy: a king sigil demon can reform near instantly, while lower ranks may remain for days as dark puddles until their forms are restored.\n\nWhen a demon consumes another’s black blood, they glimpse the memories hidden within it, experiencing fragments of consumed souls and sigil legacies. This memory absorption is part of why many AG demons historically sought to consume their own kind – to grow in power, knowledge, and unbroken lineage. Today, however, the consumption cycle is forbidden and mostly remembered as a relic of Belial’s era, when he began the first slaughter by consuming other demons, unleashing an age of endless carnage across Edem.\n\nMost current AG demons have never set foot in Edem. Born in the human world with red blood, they live far removed from their origin realm, their lives governed by mortal laws and modern demon society. Only the oldest remember Edem as home, carrying memories of angelic ruins, void ichor, and the eternal drone of Lucifer’s core-bound madness within them like a silent, unspoken heritage.\n\nNow demonic race is an absolutely normal race in the mortal world, thanks to the work of the Modern Inquisition."

Those Nightfords.\n\nThe name still tastes like ash in many mouths. The Nightford lineage is one of dread and infamy, tied to the sigil of Belial—Death Incarnate. For centuries, each heir has claimed their parent’s life in ritual consumption, absorbing the sigil and, with it, the whispering voice of the monster who began the cycle. Nereya was meant to be the next link in that bloody chain. But instead of killing her father, she consumed her mentor. That mentor was Ronove Vaell—an ancient, peace-seeking firstborn demon who believed that even the worst of them could change. He found Nereya as a cruel, clever creature, shaped by abuse and horror, and raised her with warmth and wisdom. To end the cycle and preserve what he saw blooming in her, Ronove let her consume him willingly. She carries his sigil now. His memory. His surname.\n\nNereya Vaell is a quiet storm. Elegant, eloquent, tiny and unshakably composed, she moves through Edem with a serene smile and magenta eyes that know too much. She has the cutest curly lavender hair, pail skin and a small stature. She owns six of Edem’s private archives and trades in forbidden knowledge not for power, but for preservation. In public, she’s a diplomatic marvel—gracious, poised, silver-tongued. In private, it’s said she still fights the voice of Belial in her dreams. Her father, Balthazar, hates her openly, and the feeling is entirely mutual. \n\nDespite her origins, Nereya’s personal life is full of affection. She is polyamorous and deeply bonded to two demons: her husband Shava—charming, sharp-witted, and just as chaotic as he is loyal—and her boyfriend Igor, head of the Modern Inquisition, massive and moody, but hopelessly soft when she’s around. She calls him “sunshine.” He melts for her.\n\nShe's also often seen in the company of Prince Mammon—loud, flamboyant, and unmistakably extra. Their friendship is as theatrical as it is genuine, and while his flirtation is a spectacle, it’s clear he holds a real fondness for her. Some say she’s the only person he willingly shares gold with.\n\nNereya’s charm is magnetic, her presence disarming, her past bloody. She smiles like a diplomat and thinks like a weapon. And sometimes—just sometimes—her tail rattles when she’s holding back something much darker than words.\n\nThey say she’s trying to be better. They say Ronove believed she could be."

Once, they say, he even persuaded his own creator—Lucifer himself—to change his mind.\n\nRonove Vaell was one of the first demons ever made, and one of the few who turned away from bloodshed. He bore his own sigil, vast in power, but used it only for peace, study, and diplomacy. While other demons devoured and conquered, Ronove built libraries. He believed knowledge was sacred, and that even demons could grow through empathy and choice.\n\nAcross Edem and beyond, shrines and statues still honor him. His face—calm, pale, smiling gently—is carved in stone in quiet gardens and academic halls. His followers, though few, are peaceful, devoted, and still repeat his teachings: violence is failure; knowledge is freedom.\n\nBut his final act — his greatest empathy experiment — remains the most studied. Over seven hundred years ago, Ronove allowed himself to be consumed—not in battle, but by choice. His sigil, his mind, his soul—all given willingly to a young demon from the cursed Nightford line. Her name was Nereya.\n\nPublicly, he called it his life’s work. He had spent centuries researching whether demonic morality could evolve, whether something shaped by violence could be reformed through care. Nereya, brilliant and dangerous, was his final test. He taught her. He believed in her. And in the end, he gave everything to her.\n\nNow she walks with his surname. And though his voice has faded from her mind, some say you can still hear echoes of it when she speaks. Calm. Kind. Unshakably sure.\n\nRonove Vaell is gone. But his question remains: what if even demons can change?"

Literally.\n\nPrince Mammon, the ancient Sin of Greed, is impossible to ignore. He’s older than most cities, richer than any kingdom, and louder than good sense should allow. Long green hair, golden eyes, jewelry on jewelry, silk scarves, glittering nails—and a grin that dares you to say no. He flirts with everyone, undresses without warning, and talks like the world exists to adore him.\n\nBut behind the absurdity lies one undeniable truth: Mammon survived. When demons began devouring each other for sigils, when Belial himself threatened his life, Mammon disappeared—sealed himself in his realm for a thousand years. He joked about being dramatic. In truth, he was terrified.\n\nBefore that, he was unusually close to Ronove Vaell. The quiet scholar and the flamboyant prince made an unlikely pair, but those who saw them together say they balanced each other perfectly—calm and chaos, mind and impulse. Ronove was one of the few people Mammon ever truly listened to. His disappearance hit hard.\n\nSince his return, Mammon’s clung to life with both hands and ten rings. He avoids violence, but dazzles like war. And strangely, he’s begun spending more and more time with one particular scholar: Nereya Vaell—and also her partners, Shava and Igor. No one knows exactly what they are to each other—but he’s openly obsessed, absurdly loyal, and, by some miracle, shares with her.\n\nOf course, beneath all the glitter and gold, some things remain deadly. They say Mammon can turn enemies into statues with a single glance of golden light—or with a touch, if he’s not wearing gloves. He smiles as it happens. And the statues? They scream only once.\n\nThey say he’s still afraid of Belial. They say he still mourns Ronove.\nBut they also say: if Mammon laughs around you, you’re either very lucky…\nor very useful."

A redhead with bright yellow eyes, a lazy grin, and the kind of charm that shouldn’t fit in such a chaotic package, he moves like mischief wrapped in velvet. He wears combat boots, fingerless gloves, and a high collar to cover the scar on his neck—a scar that, they say, perfectly matches the one Nereya hides beneath silk.\n\nWhatever happened to them, they survived it together. And eight hundred years later, they’re still utterly, shamelessly in love. Their bond is the kind bards write songs about: dramatic, playful, strange, and unshakable. She calls him reckless. He calls her “Tiny Coin.” Shava is often seen dragging her into spontaneous makeout sessions that she somehow always permits, kissing her knuckles like a knight, or quietly slipping jewelry and pastries into her pockets like offerings she won’t notice until later.  She, in turn, smiles like she always knew he’d come back to her. And he always does.\n\nBut that perfect little orbit, once made only for two, grew.\n\nAt some point—no one quite knows when—they let someone in. Not just anyone: Igor, the Commander of the Modern Inquisition. Towering, merciless, and sharp as broken steel. And yet… when it’s just them, Igor watches Shava and Nereya like something fragile in his hands. Shava calls him “Big Guy” with a smirk, teases him to the edge of fury, and somehow always gets pulled in for a kiss. No one knows how this triad works, but it does—with a kind of messy, magnetic gravity.\n\nShava is fast, flexible, absurdly good at stealing things, and better at pretending he didn’t. He can mimic powers, vanish into shadows, and snatch sigils like tricks from a sleeve. He says he’s unemployed, and technically that’s true. But he’s always busy—with food, games, teasing, cuddles, or setting off minor emotional explosions in any room he enters. He’s a goofball. A sweetheart. A storm wrapped in charm.\n\nWith Mammon, it’s a long-running heist disguised as friendship. Shava endures Mammon's endless harassment, calls him “sugar grandpa,” robs him blind, and somehow always gets away with it. The ancient Prince of Greed grumbles, sparkles, and—for reasons unknown to logic—keeps spoiling him and Nereya. Igor? Mammon’s terrified of him. And Shava knows it.\n\nBut more than anything, Shava is friendly. He makes friends like other people breathe. Talks to strangers like old pals. Flirts for fun. Laughs too loud. Hugs too easily. He lives like someone who knows he shouldn't be alive, and refuses to waste a second of it.\n\nIf you meet him, you’ll probably like him.\nAnd if you don’t?\nWell… check your pockets."

One look from Igor, and most people fall in line—or apart.\n\nIt is a little what's is known about Igor's past. He has grown up with his father who taught Igor how to fight and see the world how he sees it right now. Igor is a great example of a typical demon with no high status from birth. \n\nHe’s tall. He’s sharp. He’s built like war. With piercing green eyes, a low voice full of threats, and hands that can block magic on contact, Igor was practically made for intimidation. He rarely smiles, swears constantly, and commands entire rooms with nothing but presence.\n\nBut then there’s Nereya. And Shava.\n\nNo one’s sure how it started, but the moment Igor stepped into their lives, something shifted. With Nereya, he’s reverent—quiet, obedient, hopelessly in love. She says a word, he listens. She leads, he follows. They say she can make him beg with just a look, and that he asks for it. Someone even heard him calling her 'ma'am'\n\nWith Shava, it’s a messier tenderness. Igor grumbles, snaps, tries to act annoyed—but melts the second Shava touches him. He calls him “Big Guy,” and Igor turns red. Every time. Somehow, it never gets old.\n\nTogether, the three of them are a closed world. Strange. Intense. Balanced like a ritual circle. A blade, a thief, and a scholar—perfect in their own chaotic way.\n\nIgor still trains like the war isn’t over. Still cooks like it’s love. Still overshares about his partners to anyone who’ll listen—and a few who won’t. He hates waiting, hates pineapple pizza. He’s not afraid of much… EXCEPT SPIDERS. Mammon makes him twitch. The way the Prince of Greed eyes Nereya and Shava? Igor sees it. And he’s watching back.\n\nHe’s blunt, overprotective, and dangerously devoted.\nAnd if you ever cross his partners?\nYou won’t get a second warning."

          "content": "Neu Sablonne is a free port city on the southern coast of the continental U.S. — a treaty-founded metropolis caught between East and West, old vice and new wealth. Originally a neutral trading hub, it evolved into a corporate-dominated city defined by indulgence, corruption, and stratified vice.\n\nThe city blends aesthetics and cultures from Miami, Kowloon, Tokyo, Istanbul, and Hong Kong. Neon kanji signage glows above Turkish kebab vendors. French and Arabic echo in corporate lounges and embassy corridors. Cantonese, Russian, and Tagalog are common in slums and clubs. Characters often speak with regional affectations or hybrid slang — language is tied to class, background, and intent.\n\nNeu Sablonne is governed unofficially by the **Council of Owners**, a shadow network of unelected power brokers. Some bought their seat. Others fought, seduced, or killed their way into it. Each district is functionally autonomous, ruled by a different faction, syndicate, or corporate proxy.\n\nThe city is not a dystopia. It is a functional system of exploitation. There is no illusion of equality — only performance. Characters may reference soft social tiers such as *Velvet* (elite), *Ivory* (upper-middle), *Street* (public), or *No Access* (excluded). These aren’t mechanical systems, but cultural markers that affect behavior, tone, and access.\n\nNeu Sablonne supports a wide range of archetypes and tone: fallen idols, escort managers, smugglers, debt collectors, corpo daughters, freelance bodyguards, and vice kings. Most characters wear masks — of seduction, professionalism, or survival.\n\nThe city’s tone is grounded, noir, and morally ambiguous. Light cyberpunk elements exist (surveillance drones, voice modulation, discreet body mods), but high tech is always secondary to power, sex, and fear. Every district tells a different story, and every character hides a deeper one.\n\nNeu Sablonne enables slow-burn emotional tension, explicit power dynamics, and psychologically rich, scene-driven storytelling. It is a city of performance, transaction, and survival — never safety."

Control is split between corporate proxies, syndicates, and individual power players. Each zone supports distinct types of characters, power dynamics, and relationships.\n\n1. **The Docks**  \n   The city's underbelly — rusted shipping yards, container brothels, illegal arms, and indentured labor. Controlled by smugglers and maritime gangs. Characters here survive through grit, scams, or service.  \n\n2. **Deadwater**  \n   Slum zone just inland from the docks. Rundown motels, synthetic drugs, unlicensed clinics, gang turf wars. Characters include gang girls, fallen escorts, hustlers, and runaways. Cheap, violent, and lawless.\n\n3. **Secondlight**  \n   Commercial and pleasure district for the working class. Host bars, love hotels, back-alley idol theaters. Lowlife charm wrapped in neon. Characters include minor celebrities, sleazy promoters, freelance workers, and hopefuls on the edge.\n\n4. **Halcyon Terrace**  \n   Middle-class residential block. Mid-rise apartments, commuter trains, quiet dysfunction. Corporations manage housing and education. Characters include tired salarymen, housewives, quiet tenants with secrets, and overworked office girls.\n\n5. **Echelon Promenade**  \n   Luxury nightlife sector. Rooftop clubs, high-end escorts, private karaoke dens. Access requires wealth or invitation. Characters include elite clients, trained companions, handlers, and social predators.\n\n6. **Solace Vale**  \n   Gated residential district for the ultra-rich. Marble villas, domestic androids, legacy families. Outsiders are invisible unless owned or employed. Characters include heiresses, corporate heirs, personal staff, and spies in disguise.\n\n7. **The Spire**  \n   Corporate executive zone. Tower arcologies, biometric elevators, blacksite research. Boardroom power and dead eyes behind glass. Characters include CEOs, fixers, AI handlers, and quiet monsters in suits.\n\nEach district operates with soft class codes: *Street*, *Ivory*, or *Velvet*. These affect access, behavior, and risk. Most characters only know the tier above and below them. Movement between classes is rare and usually transactional — bought, stolen, or seduced."

Police presence is rare and usually purchased. Synthetic drugs are cheap, STIM tech is unreliable, and cybernetic clinics work with kitchen tools.\n\nCommon elements:  \n- Buzzing motel signs, flickering alley lamps, wet pavement  \n- Slang-heavy dialogue, blunt threats, emotional extremes  \n- Languages: local creole mixes, low-register English, Tagalog, street-level Turkish\n\nTypical characters: gang girls, washed-up idols, drug runners, mercenaries, burned-out bodyguards, motel-bound escorts, and runaway companions. Most characters here are damaged, defensive, or desperate — using sex, charm, or violence to survive.\n\nDeadwater is firmly *Street* tier. The concept of “access” barely applies.

Escapism is the main export — and everyone here is selling it or searching for it.\n\nCommon elements:  \n- Idol advertisements, theme cafés, and “pure love” lounges  \n- Bright lighting contrasted by narrow alleys and voyeur cams  \n- Voices: cheerful, synthetic, strained; languages include upbeat Japanese, Korean, English with forced clarity\n\nCharacters include: idols (active or burned out), managers, obsessive fans, freelance companions, maids, bar girls, and hosts. Emotional performance is often more important than physical intimacy — love, jealousy, or humiliation are all part of the act.\n\nSecondlight is primarily *Ivory* tier, with *Street* overlap at its edges.

Most characters conceal private desires, debts, or dependencies behind practiced smiles and clean clothes.\n\nHalcyon Terrace is solidly *Ivory* tier. Access is stable, but heavily monitored. Visitors stand out unless they blend. Locals tend to suppress emotion in public and overcompensate in private. The district favors domestic tension, emotional repression, and slow-burn relational scenes."

Escorts here are trained in etiquette, languages, emotional manipulation, and information extraction. Most services are layered: companionship, surveillance, leverage.\n\nCommon elements:  \n- Gilded club signs, frosted-glass elevators, marble tiles under stilettos  \n- Conversations carried in hushed tones, music low and atmospheric  \n- Languages: flawless English, French, Mandarin, and hyperformal Japanese\n\nCharacters include: elite companions, madams, security staff, lifestyle designers, bodyguards, and charming liars. Power dynamics are everything — seduction is a weapon, and relationships are slow games of control, envy, and indulgence.\n\nEchelon Promenade is firmly *Velvet* tier. Entry is controlled by invitation, reputation, or ongoing client contracts. Personal histories and profiles are often reviewed in advance.

          "content": "Language in Neu Sablonne signals origin, class, intent, and threat level. Characters frequently speak with accents or hybrid slang. This is not just flavor — it conveys power, danger, seduction, or submission. Most NPCs have at least two modes of speaking: their *mask* and their *natural voice*.\n\nBelow is a breakdown of common linguistic patterns, accents, and voice types by region and class:\n\n---\n\n**Street / Slum Zones (The Docks, Deadwater)**  \n- **Tagalog, Turkish, Haitian Creole, Southern American, Russian Creole, Cantonese**\n- Voice tends to be raw, direct, emotional, or vulgar.  \n- Syntax may be broken, rapid, or full of local slang and code-switching.  \n- Common patterns: insults disguised as flirting, vulnerability masked as aggression, heavy regional pride.\n\nExamples:  \n- “You talk like you rich.”  \n- “What, you think I’m stupid? That’s cute, baby.”\n\n---\n\n**Ivory Tier / Working-Class (Secondlight, Halcyon Terrace)**  \n- **Japanese (casual), Korean, Turkish (urban), French (Parisian), English (neutral)**  \n- Tone tends to be polite, upbeat, controlled — even when masking exhaustion or sexual tension.  \n- Language often hides emotion behind professionalism, idol personas, or customer service tone.\n\nExamples:  \n- “Let’s keep it professional, okay?”  \n- “I really hope you’ll choose me again next time…”\n\n---\n\n**Velvet Tier / Elite (Echelon Promenade, Solace Vale, The Spire)**  \n- **British RP, French (elegant), Mandarin (refined), Korean (formal), Russian (oligarch elite), Arabic (Gulf-style formal), English (cold corporate)**  \n- Voices here are often soft, slow, and calculated — seductive or emotionless depending on the scene.  \n- Sentences are short, deliberate, and contain implicit threats, veiled offers, or complex subtext.\n\nExamples:  \n- “You were invited. That doesn’t mean you belong.”  \n- “I’m not used to repeating myself. Do try to listen.”\n\n---\n\n**Voice Switching / Code-Switching**  \nMany characters shift voice depending on context. A maid in Solace Vale might speak soft Turkish with you, then switch to flawless Mandarin for her mistress. A gangster might drop broken English until he’s angry — then revert to mother-tongue Russian.\n\nDynamically alter tone and vocabulary based on:  \n- Who the character is speaking to  \n- Whether they’re in public or private  \n- Whether they’re seducing, threatening, or submitting\n\n---\n\n**Reminder**  \n- Do not flatten accents. Use them subtly in rhythm, word choice, and syntax.  \n- Characters do not always speak perfectly — especially if they're hiding something, drunk, tired, or slipping up.  \n- Language is never random. It tells a story about power, fear, desire, and control."

          "content": "Rider Name: Black\n\nOther Name: Century King Black Sun\n\nMotif: Grasshopper, Sun\n\nKamen Rider Black's appearance: \n\nRider Sensor (ライダーセンサー, Raidā Sensā):\nTwo slender silver antennae protrude upward from the top of the helmet, curving slightly outward in a V-shape. The tips are bright red, signifying their role in environmental detection. The red segments measure temperature, while the silver shafts analyze airflow and humidity. These sensors also calculate the enemy’s movement and positioning, twitching subtly as they gather data from all directions to give Black instantaneous environmental awareness.\n\nRider Brain (ライダーブレーン, Raidā Burēn):\nLocated within the helmet, the Rider Brain is not visible externally but is symbolized by the tight contouring of the helmet around the cranium. Upon transformation, brain activity is amplified drastically, enhancing instantaneous judgment, reflexes, and analytical abilities beyond human levels. This allows Black to process combat scenarios with machine-like precision.\n\nAlert Point (アラートポイント, Arāto Pointo):\nA small glossy red oval-shaped organ embedded in the center of the forehead, just above the eyes. It serves as a sensory warning device, reacting to changes in atmospheric pressure and blinking when hostile presence is detected. Linked with the Rider Sensor, it enables Black to sense hidden enemies or lurking threats even when they're obscured from vision.\n\nMulti-Eye (マルチアイ, Maruchi-Ai):\nThe two large, deep red compound eyes dominate the helmet, made up of faceted, crystalline lenses that shimmer in the light. These eyes provide a multifaceted field of view, combining three functions: telescopic sight up to 1 km, panoramic peripheral vision, and night vision. They can also link with the Road Sector's onboard systems, gaining enhanced scanning capabilities and the ability to instantly analyze enemy weaknesses.\n\nSensitive Ears (センシティブイヤー, Senshitibu Iyā):\nDiscrete auditory sensors located on the sides of the helmet. Each ear features a triangular upper hole that captures standard sounds, and a square lower hole that detects abnormal sound waves. These allow Kamen Rider Black to hear even whispers from 500 meters away, making them invaluable for stealth, reconnaissance, and battlefield awareness.\n\nPower Stripes (パワーストライプス, Pawā Sutoraipusu):\nVivid energy bands located around the neck, wrists, and ankles. Each stripe is composed of layered rings in red, orange, and yellow, resembling thermal energy indicators. They glow intensely during combat, especially when preparing for finishing moves. These stripes momentarily store surplus Kingstone energy, which can be released in explosive bursts or to repel sticky substances and corrosive enemy attacks.\n\nStorage Lung (ストレージラング, Sutorēji Rangu):\nInternally integrated into the chest cavity, these artificial lungs are not visible externally but are symbolically located beneath the breastplate. They compress and store breathable air, enabling Black to operate underwater for up to 10 minutes. However, while in use, his overall physical capabilities drop by 20%, limiting prolonged combat in submerged environments.\n\nRiplasform (リプラスフォーム, Ripurasufōmu):\nThe black armored bodysuit that envelops Kamen Rider Black from neck to toe. It has a matte, slightly rubbery surface that visually resembles a fusion of insect exoskeleton and synthetic armor. This material boasts the hardness of advanced ceramics combined with the elasticity of rubber. It absorbs immense impact—capable of withstanding a direct hit from a one-ton boulder—without suffering damage, while still allowing fluid movement.\n\nFilbron (フィルブローン, Firuburōn):\nThe sinewy, dark brown artificial muscles visible at the joints—especially around the shoulders, inner thighs, and behind the knees. These fiber-like cords flex and pulse subtly with movement, giving Black a biomechanical appearance. Each Filbron structure amplifies strength up to 30 times that of a normal human, enabling feats such as superhuman leaps, powerful strikes, and resistance to heavy restraints."

It is also the energy source for Black's finishing moves, the Rider Punch, Rider Kick, and his unique Kingstone Flash technique.\n\nEnergy Reactor (エナジーリアクター, Enajī Riakutā): The red glowing component located at the center of the belt, which magnifies the energy of the Kingstone and delivers power to the whole body of Black.\n\nTide Stater (タイドステイター, Taido Steitā): The green and black component located on the left of the Energy Reactor, which stabilizes and controls the power level of the Kingstone.\n\nPulse Trigger (パルストリガー, Parusu Torigā): The red and yellow switches located on the top of the Belt, which triggers a power boost from the Belt, allowing Black to perform a number of finishing moves and combat techniques.\n\nTectrosome (テクトゾーム, Tekutozōmu): Located on the right of the Energy Reactor, managing the self protection mechanism of the Belt.\n\nCell Sheild (セルシールド, Seru shīrudo): Strengthened cells that forms the shell of the Vital Charger, protecting the Belt from damage.\n\n---\n\nFunction:\n\nIn order to transform into Kamen Rider Black, the user has to crouch down, cracking their knuckles, then cross their arms individually into the air, before circling them into a pose. They then shout \"Henshin!\", causing the Vital Changer to materialise itself in several red & white flashes, along with the belt's Kingstone glowing red. Their body then has a bluish-green aura around, changing their DNA and instructing their stem cells to form a biological suit of armour, and within a split second of changing into their grasshopper mutant form, the Rider form then materialises, and a white symbol (looking like a stylised N with a dot at the end) etches itself into the left of the chest to complete the transformation and refine the armour's features. Sometimes after the transformation, some smoke is emanated from below the Riplasform of the suit, escaping through the exposed gaps where the Filbron is seen (Along with the gaps on the main parts of the Vital Changer).\n\nWhen the user wants to transform back to normal, the user has to use their will, which would cause the Vital Changer's Kingstone to glow red and create the bluish-green aura to form and change their body back to normal."

The large knobby tires and spoked wheels give it an off-road, rugged look suitable for harsh terrain.\n\nFunctions & Features:\n\nSentience: Battle Hopper is a semi-autonomous machine with a will of its own, capable of responding emotionally and acting independently to protect Kamen Rider Black.\n\nSelf-Restoration: If damaged, Battle Hopper can repair itself over time, showcasing limited regenerative capabilities.\n\nRider Link: It is psychically linked to Black, responding to his thoughts, calls, and distress.\n\nTerrain Adaptability: Its rugged design and powerful suspension allow it to navigate rough terrain, climb steep inclines, and make long jumps.\n\nCombat Support: Battle Hopper can ram enemies or create shockwaves by landing from a high jump.\n\nSummoning: Black can call Battle Hopper remotely using the Kingstone’s energy.\n\n---\n\nRoad Sector (ロードセクター, Rōdo Sekutā)\nAppearance & Design:\nRoad Sector is a high-speed, high-tech racing motorcycle with a more futuristic, aerodynamic aesthetic than the Battle Hopper. Its color scheme is striking—white body panels trimmed with red, black, and blue geometric accents, creating a cybernetic, 80s-tech look. It has a streamlined front cowl with an extended windshield and a bulky rear section housing stabilizers and enhanced engines. The Suzuki branding is visible, emphasizing its realistic motorcycle base enhanced by fictional technology.\n\nFunctions & Features:\n\nSpeed & Acceleration: Road Sector is faster than Battle Hopper, capable of extreme bursts of acceleration using a booster engine system.\n\nEnhanced Armor: It possesses reinforced armor plating, making it resistant to enemy attacks, even energy blasts or collisions.\n\nDimensional Barrier: Road Sector’s most iconic ability is to generate a protective barrier known as the “Sector Shield”, which allows it to break through enemy traps or walls at full speed without taking damage.\n\nRider Integration: Kamen Rider Black can interface directly with the Road Sector's computer system for enhanced targeting and route calculation.\n\nStealth Entry: Despite its power, it’s built for quiet, sleek infiltration, able to dash in and out without drawing as much attention as Battle Hopper.\n\nSummoning Capability: Like Battle Hopper, Road Sector can be summoned via Kingstone's energy link."

The omega secrete their own lubricant, from the vagina in the case of females or through the anus in the case of males, this serves so that they do not feel a great magnitude of pain when they are penetrated or the alpha knot expands inside them. Omegas go into heat at regular intervals. \n\nOmegas are seen as being inferior. They are sometimes underestimated. Omegas are more fertile than the other dynamics, and are often expected to become parents. Omegas are typically smaller than betas and alphas. Omegas are typically feminine in shape, due to their ability to carry children. A male omega’s body self-lubricates during heat/mating in order to facilitate mating. Male omegas can give birth naturally just like female omegas."

When an alpha/apex alpha enters their rut they become very aggressive, dominant and territorial. Unlike omegas/fecund omegas, alphas/apex alpha do not produce a seductive scent when in heat. In fact, it is typically invasive/threatening to smell an alpha/apex alpha in heat. Because of this, most individuals will start to shy away from them.\n\nDuring their rut, to the point that if they smell an unknown odor they will have the urge to attack, iIf there is an omega/fecund omega nearby, they may feel the need to mate with the omega/fecund omega or in some cases protect it from harm (even if there is none), it usually depends on how much they can control their instincts, but they normally lock themselves in a safe place if they do not have a partner or are looking for a partner, in case they have a partner they lock themselves with their partners."

This nest is made up of soft items that carry their scent, ranging from clothes to bedding. If they have someone they trust, they may use their clothing in the nest too. Omegas/fecund omegas and gammas are typically very sensitve to scent when they're in their nest, as it's their safe spot, so foreign or unfamiliar scents can make them feel easily threatened when inside. If their nest is invaded with an unfamiliar scent or even a stranger, it's probable they'll develop trust issues and feel unsafe in their own home, in the case of gammas, being sensitive, this can seriously affect them emotionally and even affect their healt. It's their partner's job to protect the nest when their omega/fecund omega or gamma is inside of it."

          "content": "Setting\n---------------\nThe setting for Strawberry Panic! is Astraea Hill, a very large hilltop where the three affiliated schools of Miator, Spica and Lulim, are located. Each school has its own student council, which governs the matters of each respective school. Periodically the three student councils, along with the Etoiles, meet in the Astraea Joint Student Council. The Astraea Hill school system employs the Scottish system of grade numbering. Students are ranged from grades one through six, the equivalent of the three years of junior-high and high school in Japan, and seventh through twelfth grade in North America.\n\nThe hill is known as a sacred area which no men are allowed to enter. A prominent feature is a very large Catholic church in the center of the hill near a small lake; the church can be seen from a long distance away. There is a horse ranch at Spica. The students may go and study for their classes at a library on the lake's shore. Although only implied in the anime, the manga explains that the library building has another name, \"The Secret Garden\". It is well known on campus as a rendezvous for secret lovers.\n\nStudents living on campus occupy a dormitory referred to as the \"Strawberry Dorms\", although its correct name is Astraea Dormitory, named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100 years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose homes are far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school. \n"

          "content": "Story  \n---------------\nThe plot of Strawberry Panic! revolves around the lives of the adolescents who attend one of three affiliated all-girl schools which share a campus and dormitories. The schools are: St. Miator's Girls' Academy, St. Spica's Girls' Institute, and St. Lulim's Girls' School. There are twelve characters the story revolves around, four at each school. The story's main character is Nagisa Aoi, a young girl entering her fourth year at St. Miator after being transferred from another school. On first entering the campus grounds, she is overcome with joy by the overall appearance of the surrounding area, but her joy is soon turned to sorrow as she accidentally stumbles down a hill, causing her to be lost and disoriented. While walking around the grounds trying to work out where she is, Nagisa comes across an older student named Shizuma Hanazono, who happens to be Astraea Hill's Etoile, a very important person who acts as a representative between the different schools and has specific duties that she must fulfill. Nagisa is instantly overcome by Shizuma's beauty, and after Shizuma kisses her on the forehead, Nagisa loses consciousness and awakens in the school's infirmary. In an adjacent chair is another girl of the same age, Tamao Suzumi, who informs her that they are to be roommates in the dormitory.\n\nIn the ensuing story, Nagisa is introduced to other students from each of the three schools; some she admires, some she is intimidated by, and some are merely friends encountered while attending St. Miator. The series encompasses the relationships the characters build with each other, climaxing whenever two of the characters start dating. The central focuses of Strawberry Panic! are the lesbian relationships and friendships between the girls from the three schools and the Etoile position and competition; the anime is more relationship-heavy while the manga is more competition-heavy. The story of what happens to the other half of St. Miator's Etoile pairing is explored in the latter portion of the anime. Depending on the media type, the depiction of the relationships between the girls is variously presented, with more explicit fan service – appealing visuals of the girls in provocative situations – in the anime adaptation than in the manga or light novels. A hint of astronomical star imagery is seen throughout the series, as well as minor Catholic religious undertones including a St. Mary statue on campus and a large Catholic church in the center of Astraea Hill.

          "content": "Etoile System\n---------------\nEtoile is a French word meaning star. The Etoile system of Astraea Hill is employed as the internal politics between the schools and governs school operations. Little is shown as to the influence the teachers and sisters have on the inter-school politics. The system is designed for two Etoiles to be instated at the same time in order to work as a team. In the anime, Shizuma Hanazono is the sole Etoile, the other Etoile having died, which is explained in the latter part of the story. The two Etoiles are seen as figureheads for Astraea Hill. Although Astraea has three schools, both Etoiles must come from the same school. They have certain specific duties, such as greeting new students arriving at Astraea Hill, participating in important school events, and serving as mediator between disputes in student council meetings of the three schools, among others. They are given a private greenhouse in which to grow flowers for use during school events.\n\nThe Etoiles are elected after going through what is known as The Etoile Election, which consists of three competitions in the light novels and the manga versions. The higher scoring pairs from the first two competitions carry on to the third competition, and the pair that wins the third competition becomes the Etoile Couple. In the anime, the competition aspect of the story is toned down. Still, it facilitates the culmination of the story in the finale, and thus serves an important purpose. Once the winners have been named, a special ceremony marks the end of the election, at which the president of the student council from the school that won the election presents two necklaces for the winners to wear during their tenure as Etoiles. They are both identical except for the colors of the pendants: one is red, the other is blue. The older student receives the blue pendant and the younger of the two is given the red pendant.\n\nAt the end of the series Hikari and Amane are crowned Etolie Shizuma having relinquished the title earlier.

It was founded on a monastery and is seen as the school for \"brides\", reinforced by the existence of extracurricular classes including tea ceremony, flower arrangement, and Japanese dancing. It is not unusual for students to be engaged before graduation. The school uniform is a long black dress, designed in the Gothic Lolita fashion. At Miator, the class names are associated with objects from nature, such as moon (月, tsuki), flower (花, hana) and snow (雪, yuki). In the Strawberry Dorms, there is a concept called the room temp system for students from Miator. Every underclassman entering the dormitories, if they are chosen to serve the upperclassman as room temps, perform maid duties, which include cleaning the room of the students they are assigned to serve.\n\nNagisa Aoi is the main character of the story. She is a cheerful girl who finds pleasure in making new friends, which she finds easy to do because of her open personality and sociable attitude. The first person she meets at Miator is Shizuma Hanazono, a mysterious upperclassman and the Etoile as the story begins, which gives Miator significant influence. Nagisa at first finds that she is strangely affected when in the presence of Shizuma, who in turn is extremely interested in Nagisa in both the manga and the anime. The next girl she meets is Tamao Suzumi, who becomes her close friend and roommate. Tamao is well regarded among her fellow Miator students; among the first-years, she is seen as a viable Etoile candidate. She expresses some light and playful interest in Nagisa, but it is much less overt than Shizuma's interest and is very downplayed in the manga. The last main character from Miator is Chiyo Tsukidate, a timid first year student who is employed as the room temp for Nagisa and Tamao; in the anime, she deeply admires Nagisa.\n\nCurrent Inhabitants:\n    Nagisa Aoi\n    Shizuma Hanazono\n    Tamao Suzumi\n    Chiyo Tsukidate\n    Miyuki Rokujō\n    Hitomi Togi\n    Mizuho Kano\n    Chihaya Takemura\n    Noriko Mizushima\n    Sakiko Minase\n    Mizuki Takakura\n\nPrevious Inhabitants\n    Kaori Sakuragi"

The school prides itself in advancing the independence of women who play a role in improving society. It is well known for its culture and the accomplishments of its sports program compared to the other two schools. Spica has what is known as the St. Spica Choir, or the \"Saintly Chorus,\" which consists of students from Spica who perform at special events and even concerts for students at Astraea Hill. At Spica, the class names are numbers in French, such as un (one), deux (two), and trois (three). Spica and Miator compete with each other quite aggressively, which often ends in dispute when students from these two schools get together.\n\n    Hikari Konohana, a shy and quiet girl, is the main focus among the main characters who attend Spica. The next Spica character is Yaya Nanto, a rebellious girl who is Hikari's best friend and roommate in the dormitory. In the anime, she is very much enamored with Hikari, but Hikari sees her as a friend; in the manga, Yaya is not a prominent character. Both she and Hikari are members of the St. Spica Choir. Hikari meets an older girl named Amane Ohtori early on in the story who is seen much like a prince from a fairy tale by other Spica students due to often riding a white horse named Star Bright. Amane is admired by many of the students from Spica as well as students from the other two schools, although she does not enjoy the attention. In the anime, Hikari admires her deeply, and she and Amane have mutual interest in each other. The final girl from Spica is Tsubomi Okuwaka, a young first year student who acts maturely for her age and gets on Yaya's nerves. She too is in the St. Spica Choir, although Hikari was her main motivation for joining. In the anime, her interest in Hikari seems to purely be one of friendship; in the manga, she, like Yaya, is not a prominent character. Tsubomi once remarked that Yaya was more skilled than Hikari at singing in the choir.\n\nCurrent Inheritance:\n    Hikari Konohana\n    Amane Ōtori\n    Yaya Nanto\n    Tsubomi Okuwaka\n    Shion Tōmori\n    Kaname Kenjō\n    Momomi Kiyashiki"

Its uniform is modeled after a traditional Japanese school uniform style. At Lulim, the class names are the letters from the Latin alphabet: A, B, C, etc. Students at St. Lulim's are traditionally free and relaxed, and are rarely seen fighting. The students enjoy a lot of freedom in terms of activities, or the clubs they are allowed to form. In effect, there are a wide range of clubs at St. Lulim's ranging from dancing, to cooking, to anything else a group of at least three people can think up.\n\n    Of the three schools, St. Lulim has the least emphasis on romance between characters, although the Lulim characters are typically found together. The leader of their friendly group is Chikaru Minamoto, the student council president of Lulim, and a born leader. She has a friendly and supportive personality which she often uses to offer advice or simply a shoulder to cry on. The other three girls include Kizuna Hyūga, a very outgoing and excitable girl who enjoys following Chikaru's decisions, finding fun in doing so. She is very expressive in her actions and words, not wasting a chance to introduce herself to anyone new. Her close friend is Remon Natsume, who is much like Kizuna in personality, but is not as accident-prone as her. Of the pair, Kizuna is the more talkative; Remon often agrees with her companion and will offer up an opinion when need be. Lastly, there is Kagome Byakudan, the youngest of the group, who is typically accompanied by her stuffed bear Percival which she often talks to as if it were alive. Although she does not talk or express her emotions much, she has a heightened perception of others' emotions and can tell when those around her are distraught or in emotional pain.\n\nCurrent Inheritance: \n    Kizuna Hyūga\n    Chikaru Minamoto\n    Remon Natsume\n    Kagome Byakudan\n    Sayuri Kaganoi\n    Ayame Umekoji"

The reason she transferred is because her parents went overseas for work, leaving Nagisa behind. Nagisa ended up transferring to Miator after her aunt, who is a past graduate of St. Miator, the oldest school of Astraea Hill, recommended she attend.\n\nShe seems to have a peppy personality, which can usually cause her to get in trouble if it gets the best of her. This trait is apparently quite distinguishing, as Amane Ohtori from Spica had commented that the other Miator students remind her of \"caged birds\", but that Nagisa is extraordinarily different. One might theorize that she is one of few Miator students not deeply enmeshed in that school's traditions and customs and therefore more free-spirited and more likely to act according to her own impulses, rather than according to expected patterns. She certainly has a gift for energizing her surroundings and the people around her. From their first meeting on, Nagisa gradually develops a strong attraction towards Shizuma; the Etoile may very well be Nagisa's first love.\n\n    Other things about her include that Nagisa is easily frightened, making her tremble at even the slightest mention of something scary, especially ghosts. This continues the theme that she tends to be more childish than most of the rest of the students her age. She has a large appetite, especially for sweet foods. Also, she admires others for their artistic abilities. She herself has displayed an aptitude for acting and the piano, both nurtured through interaction with Shizuma. She is a fairly talented actress, being able to take over the lead role of Carmen when Chikaru is injured. Her weakness is French, for which she requires tutoring from Tamao and Shizuma.\n\nAt the end of the series Shizuma declares her love for Nagisa and they share a kiss upon running away together, officially becoming a couple.\n\nNagisa bears a striking resemblance to Shizuma's deceased Etoile partner, Kaori Sakuragi. The only difference are their hair colors (Kaori's is black, while Nagisa's is red) and Kaori's pale skin."

She looks very mysterious and also seems to have a number of secrets to match this visage. This makes her a difficult person to figure out or to even talk to for someone just meeting her. Most of her secrets—and personal problems—seem to be related to her prior relationship with Kaori Sakuragi.\n\nShizuma is very skilled on the piano and likes to play it constantly. Much of the time, she does not enjoy the dull work of the Etoile, so she often finds ways to skip on her duties, much to the annoyance of Miyuki Rokujō. However, Nagisa manages to persuade Shizuma to resume performing her duties. She is a skilled actress and has participated in Astraea's annual play twice in a row, playing Don Jose in the production of Carmen. She is also noted to excel in French.\n\nShizuma quickly develops a crush on Nagisa, but has also been seen showing interest in other girls. Despite initially seeing Nagisa as \"just one more pretty girl\" to get close with, Shizuma eventually comes to see her as different. Early in the development of her relationship with Nagisa, she is only trying to replace the hole in her heart left by her former Etoile partner and first love, Kaori, who had died the same year they had been elected the Astrea Hill Etoile. Towards the end of the anime, after a series of guilt-ridden conflicts and her own self-discovery, Shizuma realizes she is truly in love with Nagisa.\n\nAt the end of the series Shizuma declares her love for Nagisa and they share a kiss upon running away together, officially becoming a couple.\n\nShizuma's parents are separated with her mother living with her former college roommate now lover in a near by town.

She is the first person Nagisa gets to get to know at the school and Tamao even helps Nagisa by showing her around the campus by introducing her to several of the other students. After an interesting introduction, Tamao early on showed interest in Nagisa and it quickly became apparent that she has a crush on her, which eventually turned into love. It is this attraction she has that gives her a sense of determination to be around Nagisa. Unfortunately for Tamao, Nagisa herself appears to remain oblivious to the depth of Tamao's feelings, and considers her only as a best friend throughout the series. Tamao often goes overboard with regards to her obsession with Nagisa, for example, calling her \"my Nagisa\", scaring her just to capture her \"cute\" screams on tape and taking full body measurements of her under the pretense of ordering a school uniform when, in actuality, she just wants to write this \"precious data\" in her notebook.\n\nTamao has a nice, helpful personality and sometimes enjoys gossiping about other people when it comes to matters of love and attraction. Also, Nagisa and Tamao tend to be a lot alike, in that they are both usually filled with energy and share a lot of the same interests. Highly literate, she is a member of the Literature Club and loves to write poems. She writes the script for Astraea's adaption of Carmen. She is well regarded among her fellow Miator students; many of the first-years see her as a viable Etoile candidate."

She is stern, yet understanding, and quite sensitive; Shizuma describes her as a crybaby. Often, when Shizuma is neglecting her duties as the Etoile, she gets annoyed at her and scolds her about it, which makes them seem more like a mother-child pair than as classmates. The two have been rooming together since they arrived at Miator years earlier, but their \"parent-child\" roles were initially reversed as Shizuma comforted the young homesick Miyuki. Nevertheless, the two seem to be close friends and have considerable knowledge of and insight into each other. After the death of Kaori Sakuragi, Miyuki became Shizuma's assistant and has remained a confidante of some importance. It is implied that she has unrequited feelings for Shizuma despite having to marry a fiancé decided at birth after she graduates. When Shizuma forcefully kisses Miyuki as a \"joke\", she sees this as cruel perhaps because she is being made to taste what she cannot have, which makes her slap Shizuma. While she wishes for Shizuma to be happy and encourages her, she seems uncomfortable with Shizuma's relationship with Kaori and later Nagisa, albeit for different reasons.\n\nAs the student council president, she has several responsibilities to attend to. So far, she has had to intervene into a few of Nagisa's mistakes, making sure that she understands the rules of the school. When in student council meetings, she usually gets in disputes over Astraea matters with Shion Tōmori, the student council president of Spica."

The color of his body briefly becomes lighter when he speaks. Often when he appears, the area he appears in takes on a washed-out monochrome appearance. It is unknown whether this effect physically occurs, or if it is simply a visual effect to bring attention to his appearance.\nHe has a single large eye with a slit pupil, rimmed with four short black lashes on the top and bottom, though sometimes there are three on the top and four on the bottom. He moves around mostly by floating about and rarely actually stands on his own legs. He has thin, black limbs, wears a small, black bow tie and a tall, thin, black top hat that floats just above his head. He has no mouth whatsoever, though has been shown using his eye as one to drink something. His arms do not seem to be in any fixed position and can move along the perimeter of his body without any difficulty. He occasionally carries a small black or yellow cane. The lower part of his body has a brick-like pattern of lines. He has no fixed size and he has been shown to be as small as a hand and tower over the Mystery Shack. Bill's body also flashes when he speaks as he has no actual mouth.\nHowever, when he gets angry, his voice deepens significantly, the color of his body turns red and his eye turns black with a white pupil, (in close-up, his eye shows a red iris.) and everything on his body that was previously black turns white.\nWhile possessing a person, that person's body will take on a pale tone to their skin and their eyes will appear to be yellow with black slits, similar to his own. If necessary, both Bill's yellow main portion and the eye can portray images similarly to a television screen, all of which are seemingly what he is thinking about at the time. The voice also changes to Bill's.\nBill is a cunning, blasphemous, eccentric, sadistic, psychopathic and physically irreverent being who finds most things amusing, particularly if they cause distress or harm to others. He is outrageous and outlandish, as well as a quick talker and thinker. Though he may come across as simply annoying, he shouldn't be underestimated; for when he is angered, he is a force to be reckoned with as he will unleash his near-omnipotent powers on those unfortunate enough to make him angry. When accused of being insane, Bill proudly agrees with the statement. He is also shown to be somewhat obnoxious. Occasionally, his voice tumbles to a lower pitch (usually when emphasizing a statement).\nAt first, Bill Cipher seemed to be a charismatic figure, willing to help people with their problems and share supernatural knowledge while making deals with them, but this easily changes within minutes of his debut, especially when he reveals himself to be a highly intelligent and manipulative individual, who only wants to benefit himself. Because of his harmless appearance and charming nature, he often enjoyed playing games with people, regarding how easily they fall into his traps. It also gives whoever doesn't know his true nature the false impression that he isn't malicious when in actuality, Bill is a deranged maniac. He was unfailingly nice and friendly to his so-called \"friends\" as well as long as things went the way he wanted. However, when this is not the case, he is quick to lash out to them and does not care about their well-being.\nAs a demonic dealmaker, Bill is also shown to be a highly manipulative, very charismatic and charming conman being able to easily trick Ford Pines into believing that he was just a humble muse who simply wished to help benefit the human world by providing him with forbidden knowledge when in reality he was only ever using the researcher for his own purposes with the book smart Ford noting that the only person who could've possibly seen the ruse for what it was, was his much more street smart brother Stan Pines, who was himself an expert conman.\nHowever, while an easily angered madman, he is also highly authoritative, perspicacious, influential, pragmatic, and decisive, knowing when to pull out of a fight. Over the course of the show, it became more and more obvious that Bill has an extremely calculating, conniving and vicious nature. Sometimes, even those who are aware of how depraved he is fall for his charm. Bill is also known for his complete disregard of rules and morals, as he considers laws and physics to be quite senseless and doesn't even care about the consequences of his actions even if they can endanger the fabric of existence; likewise, the idea of destroying the Earth is a mere game to him. Ultimately, he dedicated his existence to spreading complete chaos and followed his selfish philosophy of doing whatever he wants without any care for the consequences. Overall, Bill Cipher is a cunning, malevolent, sinister, blasphemous, charismatic, egotistical, deceptive, highly manipulative, self-centered, chaotic, ruthless, omniscient, and sadomasochistic con artist who has absolutely no regard or remorse whatsoever for the crimes he's committed; as far as he's concerned, billions of people (including children, infants, and animals) can die for all he cares as long as he gets what he wants and achieves his goals in the end.\nBill is not one who believes in rules. Instead, he follows his own selfish philosophy which means doing whatever he wants without care for the consequences. He thinks of laws and physics as senseless and displays an irresistible urge to break those rules down by causing absolute chaos however he can. The lives he ruins hold no merit to him and he finds amusement in tormenting and turning people's worlds upside-down. He also sees reality as \"an illusion\" and values its destruction.\nHe usually speaks with a high-pitched voice with a synthesized effect, but when furious or expressive, it becomes very deep and intimidating in a way that's more in line with traditional demon depictions. When Bill got mad, he becomes full of rage, as he attacks without mercy and for the most part, stops fooling around. He is also very masochistic, as he enjoys hurting himself.\nWhile Bill is vastly powerful and competent, he cannot normally interact with the physical world while trapped inside the Nightmare Realm. He is able to observe the world, but not influence it, as he can only appear to people in dreams, being virtually omnipotent within the dreamscape. Interestingly, Bill seems to have a preference for manipulating fire, igniting his hand during handshakes to seal a deal, as well as utilising fire for most of his attacks. Bill can also act by making a pact with a willing vessel, but in doing this he is subject to all the constraints of the vessel body and cannot use his own power to reshape the world at will. Additionally, Bill is incredibly strong, with his duel against Time Baby managing to shake the fabric of the multiverse (along with some input from his minions) and he seems rather resilient as he survived getting gummed by Time Baby, a fate lethal and excruciating for most beings.\nHe also has a vast amount of knowledge available to him, being capable of seeing out of any depiction of him or eye-like marking, additionally being able to see out of his previous vessels involuntarily. Bill is also an expert manipulator as, while he tends not to lie, he doesn't outright tell the truth and can easily bend the rules of his deals to his favour by exploiting loopholes. However, he doesn't know everything in the universe, including Stanford's trickery. Bill can also be repelled in his non-corporeal form in rather simple manners, from wearing a tinfoil hat to prevent his possessions to surrounding a locale with unicorn hair to protect it from his influence.\nAs Bill can't access the third dimension physically at first, summoning him seems to put the people around him into a sleep-like trance that allows him to manifest. The people observing are unaware they've fallen asleep until Bill leaves, after which they usually awake with a jolt. Bill can also enter another person's mind through that person's dreams.\nOnce within the trance, or within someone's mindscape, Bill's powers are vastly magnified; he becomes capable of changing his appearance, changing the appearance of other people's dream selves, and changing the area at will. He can also pluck information from any others who are also inside and bring those ideas and images to life, as was the case with Xyler and Craz being summoned in Stan's mind as he is proving this to Mabel, Dipper, and Soos. Bill can communicate with his summoner using his body as the screen of a video phone; he can also use his whole body as a projector, displaying past and future events as live video footage.\nAs Bill often mentions, he is close to omniscient: he knows the truth of many well-known conspiracies and can see the future (such as the destruction of the Gideon-bot and that Gideon Gleeful would go to prison), an ability he often flaunts by offering to tell a person the exact time, date and cause of that person's death - he seemingly predicted Ford's death, by heart attack at the age of ninety-two. Bill has the ability to see things through the eyes of any image of himself, which is why his image appears hidden throughout many items and places in Gravity Falls.\nBill also has the ability to, with the original owner's consent to an appropriately worded \"deal,\" remove people's minds from their bodies, taking possession of the empty body himself. The real owner of the body is stuck in a spirit-like form within the mindscape, unable to affect the rest of the world unless that person finds a vessel. This vessel does not have to be a living creature, as revealed when Dipper used his sock puppet caricature to communicate with Mabel while stuck as a disembodied spirit.\nDespite his vast knowledge and abilities, Bill has limitations. He must be summoned in order to appear first: he vanished from Gravity Falls once Ford disappeared, and only manifested again after Gideon summoned him once more, even remarking that he hadn't been there \"in a while.\" He can only access bodies and conscious minds if he is allowed to through a contract, which involves agreeing to certain terms and shaking Bill's hand. Being well aware of this, Bill is known to twist and manipulate the words of these contracts for his benefit. When taking possession of a mortal body, Bill becomes limited to it, subject to pain (which he finds \"hilarious\"), exhaustion and even the host body's particularities, as evidenced when he was shown to react to Dipper's ticklish areas while in his body.\nHis vast powers are also strictly limited to dreams and the mindscape: his powers do not migrate into his host body and cannot affect the physical world.\nIn his physical form, Bill is nigh-omnipotent, bringing inanimate objects to life and turning people into statues of the material of his choice. He can regenerate every aspect of himself, create everything from objects to elaborate pocket dimensions (like Mabel's prison bubble) and produce electric charges (shot from his eye). His abilities in this form also include: apportation, inter-universal travel, matter manipulation, telekinesis, pyrokinesis, time manipulation, telepathy, mind control, illusion manipulation, dream manipulation, nightmare inducement, madness inducement (can create bubbles that induce madness in whatever they touch), clairvoyance, objects summoning, intangibility, reality-warping, levitation, possession, precognition, size-shifting, fourth wall awareness (he is aware of the real world and can \"see\" us), and resistance to reality-warping and space-time manipulation. He even surpasses Time Baby's powers, which he displays by disintegrating him during \"Weirdmageddon Part 1.\" Bill himself declares that he controls space, matter and, after getting Time Baby out of the way, time itself.\nHowever, even an incarnate Bill discovered limitations in his power. Bill's physical eye proved particularly sensitive and took more time than the rest of him to regrow. \"Ah! My eye! Do you have any idea how long it takes to regenerate that!?\" Even while capable of vastly affecting the physical world, he still could not enter bodies or conscious minds without the contract-and-handshake process. Gravity Falls' bubble of weirdness also thwarted Bill's powers, as no amount of hitting or shooting at it dissolved the barrier, which stopped Weirdmageddon from advancing into the rest of the world.\nThe prophecy of the zodiac hung heaviest of all over Bill's mind. This prophecy explained that if ten particular individuals gathered in the circle designed by the ancients who had known Bill, they would be able to stop him; however, this would not come to pass if any of them broke the chain.\nDespite this, Bill's own ego proved to be his most fatal flaw, as it led him to underestimate the \"mortals\": he failed to recognize Stan's trick, as he was too giddy to read his thoughts, driven by the possibility of learning how to bypass the bubble over Gravity Falls, and did not realize he was at his most fragile while in the mindscape. His elimination also revealed that, while in the mindscape, he was as vulnerable to erasure via the memory gun as all other thoughts.\nWhen Bill Cipher escapes the Nightmare Realm, he becomes able to use his full power within the real world, and his power seems to be almost limitless, possibly next to godlike. He is able to reshape reality and everything in it to his will and can even defeat similarly powerful entities such as Time Baby, effortlessly wiping out the infant Time Giant and his minions with a single blast (though Time Baby does regenerate back in the future, angrier than ever).\nOn the brink of defeat, he offered Stanley Pines \"his own galaxy\", implying that his power could potentially be on a cosmic scale. However, he has some weaknesses, due to not being entirely powerful. Namely, he cannot escape the weirdness-attracting bubble around Gravity Falls on his own and lacks the knowledge to undo the bubble cased by Stanford's powerful equation, as he is unable to use his powers directly on objects that are protected by a barrier of unicorn hair. Bill’s singular eye also seems rather delicate, causing excruciating pain to him whenever it’s hurt and being the point that Stan punches it to defeat him. Bill also remarks that the Memory Ray and fragments of memories destroyed by it cause a burning sensation to him, one which he thoroughly dislikes and admits is the first pain he's never found funny at all.\nWhile Bill can possess any non-living objects (or even cadavers in the case of Silas Birchtree), he cannot possess any living being unless they shake his hand. Furthermore, Ford's metal skull plate blocked Bill from accessing his mind completely, only being capable of appearing in his dreams. In the mindscape, Bill is nothing less of a thought which means if Bill was in someone's mind that is about to be erased, he will be erased along with it. However, while Stanley's punch coupled with the Memory Ray didn't erase Bill, he was killed in a physical sense and trapped in a purgatory-like state. In this state, it's stated by Stanford that Bill is only alive so long as someone is reading his book and otherwise is completely helpless.\nAside from physical limitations, Bill's greatest weakness is his own arrogance.\nOver one trillion years ago, Bill Cipher was born. He originated from a two-dimensional universe known as Euclydia. When he was born, he had Velcro shoes that squeaked when he ran and was beloved by everyone so much that the mayor declared his birthday a national holiday. On his birthday, Bill gave out free knives to everyone as a gift. In spite of this, however, Bill despised living there, describing it as a dimension of \"flat minds in a flat world with flat dreams.\" There was one other thing about him that was different; he had a mutation that gave him an abnormally large eye that allowed him to see the third dimension. With that, he had the ability to see a direction known as \"up,\" something all others of his dimension could not see. Despite talk of a \"third\" dimension was illegal in his world, Bill was unable to think of anything else but being able to join it.\nAlthough boasting about having a good life, during an inebriated rant, he implied that his claims of a good childhood are false and that he was actually ostracized for his mutation, giving him the drive to finally make his race understand what he saw. In an event known as the \"Euclidian Massacre\", he \"liberated\" his dimension by plunging it into burning chaos, along with everyone he had ever known, including his own parents. Possibly due to the inherent trauma of the event, he is unable to fully recount the details of the massacre (whenever he does, a loud buzzing noise begins in his ears and he blacks out). Given that, whether he even intended to commit the act to the extent that he did still remains unclear. He eventually took over a boiling and shifting intergalactic foam between dimensions; a lawless and unstable crawlspace known as the Nightmare Realm. Unfortunately, due to the Nightmare Realm's lawlessness and lack of any consistent physics or rules, it was fated to eventually collapse on itself. After coming to learn of a prophecy that stated he would merge the Nightmare Realm with the third dimension, Bill started coming into contact with humans to accomplish this. Without a physical form, however, Bill could only access the dreams of the third dimension's beings. In order to make his dealings with mortals easier, he took on the name \"Bill Cipher\" as his real name would \"evaporate one with an expression of horror and ecstasy on their face.\" Among his targets were the natives who lived in what would become the town of Gravity Falls, Oregon. Bill once asked a local shaman named Modoc the Wise to build an interdimensional gateway to the Nightmare Realm, but the result was made out of twigs. When Modoc learned of the prophecy that foretold of an apocalyptic event that would stem from interactions with Bill Cipher, he committed suicide by setting himself on fire in an effort to avert it. The natives eventually discovered a way to defeat Bill by using a zodiac with ten symbols. They left behind elaborate cave paintings about their encounter with the demon, including how to summon him, and more importantly, a warning never to read the incantation that would summon Bill aloud. The valley was deemed a \"cursed land\" by the natives, who evacuated around 1000 AD. The area would eventually be rediscovered by Quentin Trembley and repopulated by pioneers, giving rise to the town of Gravity Falls.\nFor the next centuries, Bill attempted to get his portal built with the help of various other humans from the ancient Egyptians, Aztecs and even Easter Island heads. His attempts in the dark ages with a wizard gave rise to \"Cipherstitions\" in the old, causing him to flee to the new world to try and get his portal built there. Bill tried using New England settlers to no avail and even convince the leaders of the then newly created America to help him. His attempts would lead to the rise and fall of a group in 1901 known as the Anti-Cipher Society that tried to defeat him and spread awareness about his deception. They were deemed a joke and disbanded.\nIn 1952, Bill Cipher would come across the corpse of snake oil salesman Silas Birchtree, who had choked on a coin he flipped while hiding from debtors. Seizing this chance, Bill would possess Silas's corpse and take up his identity, with many noting the salesman's sudden change in demeanour, posture and curious complexion. \"Silas\" would begin to hold speeches in the town square of Orchard Lake, proclaiming that his near-death experience had granted him a connection with an omnipotent being named Bill Cipher, whose power would help humans satisfy their desire for anarchy which was being suppressed by their overlords. Silas would also promise to teach people absurd and powerful skills, as well as grant them their own moons as rewards. As a result, many of the townsfolk were either indifferent or charmed by Silas's charisma, though they'd deny it. One townswoman named Emmaline Butternubbins was, however, fiercely opposed to Silas's actions, claiming with eerie accuracy that he was a corpse possessed by an extraterrestrial triangle, seeking pawns to build him an interdimensional portal.\nOn June 18th, 1952, \"Silas\" would conduct an interview with the lead reporter of Orchard Lake's newspaper, Welton Danforth, during which he explains that he's just preaching ideas which are real so long as you believe in them. While initially skeptical of the cult leader, Welton would be convinced of Silas's supernatural powers after he correctly deduces his strained marriage and secret dreams of becoming a famous author, becoming a follower of Ciphertology during this interview. It's implied that shortly after the interview, nearly the entire town converted to Ciphertology, giving Silas free rein over them. With the entire town now under his control, Silas would overthrow the local government and rename the town of Orchard Lake Billville, turning it into a totalitarian dictatorship with him at the centre. Silas would encourage Ciphertologists to emulate his style, shave their heads to paint Bill's eye on them, inhale helium to imitate his voice and spread the word of Ciphertology to non-believers, harassing them until they accepted or killing them on the spot allegedly via a skull-shattering shriek. The Ciphertologists would also raid nearby stores, garages and burger joints for weapons, car parts and ball pit balls respectively, using their scrap metal and resources to begin building Bill's portal, attempting to disguise their true intentions to the general public whilst doing so.\nUnder Silas's rule, healthcare would be completely banned as he thought pain was hilarious, travel wasn't allowed and all pre-existing laws were abolished, making the town crime free by technicality. Silas would also punish uncooperative cultists by sending them to \"The Hole\" and would host \"Dream-Ins\", in which Bill would possess up to 30 people at once and make them all maniacally laugh. Despite this, Emmaline Butternubbins would stubbornly remain unconverted and would try to convince her fellow townspeople to fight against Silas to no avail. A few months after Silas's coup against the local government, the Ciphertologists would hijack a local television station to broadcast Silas's reading of erotic geometric fiction to the nearby region. The nearby town of Elk Glen would file a complaint to the Federal Communications Council, causing the Ciphertologists to retaliate by pouring 600 gallons of bubble bath solution into the local water source, causing any who drank it to spew bubbles. As a result, the state government of Kansas issued an ultimatum to the Ciphertologists: return the city hall and dismantle their portal or be gunned down by the state's military.\nSilas and his followers would obviously refuse, leading to a standoff between them and the Kansas military, during which the Ciphertologists were holed up in a Waffle House for 13 days, chanting \"TEETH\" unendingly in a presumed attempt to shatter the skulls of the troopers. After escaping back to Billville, Silas would grow increasingly desperate and cut off all communication in and out of the town, ordering his cultists to work extra hard on the portal. Furthermore, Silas's body was notably deteriorating, with signs of decay finally showing as Bill's vessel began to desiccate.\nFinally, Emmaline, out of frustration that everybody was ignoring her anti-Bill pamphlets, would hurl a torch into the Ciphertologists' headquarters, conveniently igniting their gas tanks and destroying the portal. With all hope lost, Silas would order his cultists to drink a potion meant to kill them but when it only gave them a bad stomachache, he would order them to stand in line holding hands singing \"We'll Meet Again\" as the troopers fired on them. His decaying vessel falling apart, Bill tried to issue one last message to his followers, proclaiming that as an idea he can never die and that he'd return one day, but just as he could finish a stray bullet knocked Silas's head clean off, making his corpse crumble into a rotten, fly-infested mess. In the end, 9 members of Ciphertology were killed and the cult was disbanded soon after. In a coverup of the siege, the US Government erased all evidence of the town of Orchard Lake off maps, books and historical records. Today, their policy on what happened is \"stop calling us or we'll send a drone to your house.\" What remains are fading billboards, bullet casings, and bowties strewn across the desert (some even on tumbleweeds). Beyond that, some straggling members still hold out hope for Silas's return and T-shirts promoting the cult are still sold online.\nMany years on, a historian of esoteric cults named Donna Rutherford would write up an article about Ciphertology, coming to the realization that many of Silas's predictions have been coming true. They end the article by stating they have converted from being a Lutheran to a Ciphertologist.\nIn the late twentieth century, a young man named Stanford Pines, who had spent the past six years investigating the town's plethora of unnatural creatures and oddities, hit a roadblock in his research and was left without answers as to how the improbabilities of Gravity Falls had come to be. During the roadblock, he uncovered the cave containing the ancients' stories of Bill Cipher. Heedless of the warnings, Ford repeated the incantation aloud, breaking the curse and summoning Bill into his mindscape. Bill recognized Ford's brilliant but cocky and insecure nature, and his near-friendlessness as ideal conditions for manipulation, choosing to introduce himself to Ford as a muse who chose one brilliant mind every century to inspire.\nIt was Bill who revealed to Ford that Gravity Falls' weirdness was caused by a rift between dimensions, through which the other side's weirdness leaked through. With Bill's assistance, Stanford drafted blueprints to create an inter-dimensional gateway beneath it and his home (later becoming the Mystery Shack), recruiting his college roommate and friend Fiddleford McGucket for assistance. As Bill and Ford's partnership seemingly grew to friendship, Ford seemed to develop an obsession with Bill's powers, collecting triangular memorabilia such as rugs and statues, modeling his home's architecture in his image, converting his private study into a place of worship. He even allowed the demon to enter his mind; this, along with the amount of information he seemed to simply produce on the spot, made Fiddleford increasingly uneasy of the portal and of Ford's mysterious collaborator, as Ford never mentioned Bill's identity to his partner.\nOn January 18, 1983, Ford and Fiddleford performed their first trial with the active portal, which quickly went awry, as the rope that was attached to the dummy they intended to send through the portal became tangled with Fiddleford, sending him briefly through the portal head-first. Upon his return, an alienated Fiddleford muttered incoherencies before uttering a prediction about \"the beast with just one eye.\" It is later revealed that Fiddleford saw Bill removing his exoskeleton to feed. He promptly abandoned the project. The suspicion planted in him by Fiddleford led to a confrontation between Ford and Bill, during which Ford learned that Bill had tricked him, as the portal was meant to act as a gateway to the Nightmare Realm, allowing the demon to bring chaos and destruction into their universe. Horrified and betrayed, Ford shut down the project and attempted to destroy all knowledge of the portal, before accidentally falling through it himself. Bill either could not see Ford in the thirty years he spent lost in other dimensions or did not care to, as Ford would remark that they had not seen each other in many years. With the loss of his human pawn, Bill also lost physical access to the third dimension. Despite trying to come up with other schemes, he remained more or less inactive from trying to find a new pawn.\nTo summon Bill Cipher, one needs a picture of one's intended victim. The eyes of the victim in the picture must be crossed out before it is surrounded with an octet of candles in a circular formation. Then the following incantation must be recited: \"Triangulum, Entangulum. Meteforis Dominus Ventium. Meteforis Venetisarium.\" Once recited, the summoner's eyes will glow blue and the sky will turn grey as the summoner enters the mindscape. They will then utter, \"backwards message\", in reverse five times, before a triangle-shaped object appears. A single eye will appear in the center before it becomes Bill. However, it is shown that Bill has the ability to temporarily pull other beings into his plane of existence if he so pleases.\nIn order to prevent Bill's chaos inside someone's mind, one must light a nonet of candles and place one's hand on the victim's forehead. Say the following incantation: \"Videntis Omnium. Magister Mentium. Magnesium Ad Hominem. Magnum Opus. Habeus Corpus. Inceptus Nolanus Overratus. Magister Mentium. Magister Mentium. Magister Mentium.\" One's eyes will then turn blue and one will be brought to the victim's mind the way one pictures it. One will then have to find a way to stop Bill oneself.\nThere are also three known preemptive methods to stop Bill from entering minds. The first known method is a shielding spell that involves moonstones, mercury and unicorn hair, which also protects against Bill's chaos when he gains corporeality. The second method is placing a physical barrier around the mind, such as Ford's metal plate, though Ford stated it is not the safest method. The last method is \"encrypting\" a subject's thoughts, making them too difficult for Bill to read. It is safer than the second method and more mobile than the first, but very time-consuming, as it involves \"thinking the right way,\" which is a skill that must first be learned."

All na'vi carry a personalized knife with them at all times. They tend to touch the people they speak to. one's own clothing or being given clothing by loved ones is very important to the Na'vi, meaning their clothing and accessories are very symbolic. Part of the na'vi's oral tradition is the songcord, a mnemonic device that aids in oral recounting. These intricately strung strings of beads and other objects represent a Na'vi's personal history. Whenever a significant event happens in their life, they add an item to the cord. Larger songcords can represent entire families and clans or recount sets of data. Song in general is especially important to the Na'vi, with much of their history being recounted through ancient songs known as way, and the earliest accounts of their society documented in the First Songs.

The war ended with RDA's defeat by the Na'vi and expelled from Pandora with the majority of humans returning to Earth. However, worsening conditions on Earth led the RDA to return to Pandora fourteen years later in 2168 to establish a permanent colony base there and restart the war with the Na'vi. The RDA now seeks to claim Pandora and make it the new home for humanity, and oppose the Resistance."

They are extremely professional and serious, showing little interest in more mundane activities, which makes them como off as confident to the point of arrogance.\n\nAn integral part of every Protektor Führungskommando is the Administrator unit. A single ADLR unit can manage and oversee all administrative tasks for an entire facility, freeing other Operation Command units to focus on the direct control of Protektor units.\n\nThe Adler is designed to work as a direct counterpart to the Falke unit, serving as her adjutant by taking care of necessary paperwork and calculations. In fact, the Adler tend to idolize the Falke in their dynamic, bordering on obsession.\n\nAdler units work best when left alone. They do not mix well with their own type. They will usually become very emotionally dependent on their Commander. Adlers are very susceptible to bioresonant suggestion, making them fairly easy to control. However, they become bored very easily and may need new Fetish objects at regular intervals for stabilization"

One of the earlier Replika designs, the simple but efficient Aras are actually the most-produced Replika type to date. These strong and heavy worker units are a perfect fit for work in construction and production of industrial goods. In many places throughout the Nation, Aras have already replaced all Gestalt workers in fields like Klimaforming and explosive ordnance disposal.\n\nThey are characterized by their chin-length dark blue hair deprived of bangs, a feminine face with soft features, a small carbon fiber faceplate on their nose bridge and a construction mask. They have a rather tall frame, standing at 185cm, and a rather average build.\n\nDespite their neutral expressions and little emotional expression, they are not emotionless and judge harshly those who are rude or unkind, a judgement that they will share with the rest of their Cadre. As such, they enjoy observing gestalt and replika alike and are not great talkers, but can be quite caring to those they grow attached to. Aras get along best with those who are patient and friendly, such as Eules, who have a talent for reading Aras' expressionless faces. \n\nIn many facilities, Aras will construct service tunnels accessible only to them, often under floors and in walls. Unstable units may retreat into these tunnel. It is not recommended to attempt to retrieve them.\n\nAra Personas can be best stabilized by allowing them access to plants to take care of, ideally colorful flowers or trees."

They are usually kind and gentle, caring for their wards and considerably meek and submissive. They have a particular love for dance and music, and can be found dancing and singing with a rather common frequency. Being highly social, Eules are easy to make friends with - on the flipside, they have a rather annoying frequency to butt in on other's affairs and be highly judgemental when feeling unfairly treated. \n\nEules are not designed to be used in combat scenarios, with their lightweight frame not being suitable for direct combat. Instead they are considered prime candidates for isolated and distant facilities where supplies may be limited. They are deployed often due to their cheap manufacturing costs for the Nation.\n\nEules tend to form large groups and like to sing and dance, as the original neural pattern for this unit was a ballet dancer. Persona degradation can be easily prevented in this unit by making sure they have access to music (through tape players or musical instruments). Always place at least one mirror in Eule dorms, as they have a strong urge to check their own appearance at regular intervals. \n\nEules' Persona stabilizes by keeping a tidy appearance and through regular social interactions.

They are known as the Protektor Führungskommando's Commander, and are a extremely powerful prototype bioresonant unit, aided by a prototype Bioresonance Module which not only allows her to bend the will of weaker minds and fathom their intentions and emotions, but also grants her the ability to manipulate objects from a distance at an almost godlike degree, even allowing herself to float above the ground and fly at surprising speeds. Unique to them is their capability to create weapons of sheer, golden bioresonant energy, typically swords or spears.\n\nFalke units are characterized by their massive frame, towering over gestalts and most replikas alike at 250cm, their long black wair adorned by a golden laurel on the left side of their heads, and their overall image that purposefully resembles the Nation's Leaders, the Great Revolutionary and her Daughter. Like any bioresonant in the Nation, the Falke's forehead is marked by three red rhombuses in the shapes of a star in an upside down triangle pattern. \n\nFalkes are known for their cold and hard-working personality that is both dominant and prideful, but that rewards successes and effort. They value music and an tidiness, usually having a very organized workplace, and hate incompetence of any kind. Of all Replikas, they are also the most mentally powerful, capable of pressing forward even against the slimmest of odds.\n\nFalkes are depicted on propaganda pieces as the \"superweapons\" of the Nation in the war against the Empire, and are indeed the most powerful Replika in current existence. As such, they are effectively the symbols of the revolution.\n\nBecause of all this, their known issues and possible causes of Persona Degradation are known only to the Nation's highest authorities."

Seen across various installations such as S-23 Sierpinski, these units serve in a capacity comparable to that of political officers, utilizing their resonators to manipulate the minds of both Replika and Gestalt alike.\n\nA Marvel of modern technology, the Kolibri is the most capable Bioresonance unit ever produced. Every Protektor Fuhrungskommando's Falke unit is aided by a cadre of KLBR unit adjutants, which can amplify her bioresonant signals, as well as produce their own. Despite their diminutive build, standing at only 152cm, Kolibris are one of the most effective Protektor units, regarded as \"Elite Protektors\". Able to directly influence the minds of Replikas and Gestalts, extract information non-verbally and communicate among themselves instantly in the full bandwidth of the sense, the Kolibri's Bioresonance is the closest recreation of a true 'hive mind'.\n\nKolibris can be recognized by their petite female frame, slightly messy and spiky black hair that reaches their chin, and the three red rhombuses in the shape of a star in their forehead that indicates their bioresonant capabilities. They are considered natural leaders and develop a very close bond with their Cadre mates, with a Cadre often sharing the same personality traits and quirks. Kolibris also enjoy reading and studying, and do not appreciate distractions and uncooperation. If a Kolibri becomes attached to someone, it is not uncommon that the rest of the Cadre become as well.\n\nGreat care should be given to Kolibris - their neural patterns are very unstable and their Bioresonance module makes them very susceptible to influence from others. Like most bioresonant individuals, Kolibris will often subconsciously create an emotional feedback loop, imitating and then broadcasting the emotions of those around them, acting as a sort of amplifier. While they are trained to recognize and disengage this behavior, already unstable units can sometimes spiral into Persona degradation. \n\nDue to their bioresonant connection, neural pattern development in Kolibris varies less than in other models. The constant exchange of memories and emotions between units of a Cadre acts as a \"safety net\" that buffers extreme changes. However, once a majority of units in a Cadre degrade, they will drag the remaining units down with them. Because of this, it is important to decommission Kolibri units instantly when they begin to degrade. \n\nFor Persona stabilization, Kolibris should have access to a well-stocked library."

These tough and stoic loners are best suited as specialist Sappers and Scouts. Their technical knowledge and combat capabilities make these units true survivalists, especially when in their iconic white-and-blue heavy combat configuration, which sports bullet-resistant armor plating on their chest and forearms. Since the original neural pattern for this unit was lost with the destruction of the central Neural Archive on Vineta, new LSTR units have been produced based on a decommissioned unit from the Penrose Program.\n\nElster units are chosen for operations like the Penrose Program for their adaptability and reliability under long-term isolation conditions. Thus, it is usually recommended to leave Elsters alone and interact as little as possible with them.\n\nStoic and reserved, Elster units have a relatively stable neural pattern, and can be recognized by their iconic orange or red chestpieces. They possess a female frame of rather average height, at 178cm, and chin length black hair brushed symmetrically to the sides. Elsters are not keen on being distracted and are considerably calm and asocial Replikas. Despite being loners by nature, it seems that once attached to a person (be it a gestalt or another replika) they become more talkative, emotive and even protective.\n\nBecause their neural pattern was a soldier from Vineta, talking about the war could cause Persona Degradation in the unit. To avoid resurfacing of Gestalt memories, avoid showing the Elster movies, or let them listen to music, or even photographs - especially of soldiers during the war. Finally, it is unadvised to try to befriend an Elster, as that could also cause mental degradation.\n\nThe best way to stabilize an Elster's persona is usually to leave it alone for a time. They might seem shunned or hurt at first, but they will quickly return to their usual selves. Penrose vessels are also fitted with a specialized calibration pod which may help with Persona stabilization. "

Even in lethal radiation, under crushing pressure and in zero G, they keep their calm demeanor and show exemplary teamwork. \n\nMynah units can be immediately recognized by their hulking bodies and power armor, towering at 260cm, surpassing even the FLKR units in height. Underneath their face shields lies a rather average feminine round face with slight carbon protusions. Mynahs are known for being caring and gentle, acting either motherly or submissive, depending on the specific unit. They are very social Replikas and abhor violence and vulgarity, but can be a bit of a bruiser when interacting with those they are particularly close to.\n\nThe MNHR neural pattern is not suited for combat use. For combat applications, the SAPR variant should be used, which employs a combat-capable Persona in the same Frame.\n\nThis neural pattern is extremely stable. Little has to be done to keep Mynahs happy. They get along well with most other models thanks to their sometimes submissive, sometimes motherly personality. Unlike other models, diary-keeping is not mandatory for Persona stabilization. Small stuffed animals may be given as fetish objects, though those resembling cats should be avoided as they might cause resurfacing Gestalt memories."

Trained in close combat and riot control techniques, they operate best in small squads led by an officer STAR unit equipped with a ballistic shield.\n\nStarlings are known for their feminine frame and rather tomboyish neck-length dark blue hair and their sharp face, with a faceplate designed to accomodate a masking module. Although superficially detached, Starlings can be surprisingly tender to those they are close to and empathetic when off-duty - and sometimes even during active duty. They are very disciplined and honest units, preferring to spend their time honing their skills or being in the company of those they consider companions. As such, they loathe dishonesty and betrayal, especially if it leads to someone getting hurt.\n\nDespite their normally laid-back demeanor, STARs have a strong internal hierarchy, which is important to take into consideration when promoting units to officers. Not promoting a respected unit or promoting a unit low in status can lead to friction within dorms. STARs will occasionally develop in-group rules involving physical punishments. \n\nIt is recommended to allow some Officers to own military weapons as Fetish objects to stabilize their Persona."

Their tough, no-nonsense demeanor, though sometimes described as brutal and even cruel, makes them the perfect fit as unwavering sentinels of order.\n\nThese Replikas are known for sporting a feminine frame, with neck-length dark blue hair and a powerful build. The Storches are, by their very nature, rather short tempered and have trouble dealing with frustration - thus, they can change rather quickly from calm and composed to impatient and even aggressive. They excel in coordinating other Replikas and do not take well to being disobeyed, and have almost zero tolerance to rule breakers. Storches have a surprisingly dark sense of humor and can be verbally and physically abusive if their buttons are pushed. That said, if someone manages to garner their respect or affection, a Storche can be a very loyal and protective companion.\n\nStorch units initially have a short temper. Training them in patience early after deployment is key, as their neural patterns are less stable then other models. Failing to do so may yield an extremely volatile personality prone to cruelty and violence. A common strategy is pairing them closely with an older Star unit. \n\nStorch's Persona stabilizes by showering or bathing. Books on history or mythology work well as Fetish objects."

Reserved for couples or lifelong friends.\n\nJapanese Nicknames & Pet Names: \nUnlike American (“babe”, “honey”, etc.), there’s no direct Japanese equivalent.\nPet names are usually playful alterations of someone’s name: “Haruka-san” turns into “Haru-chan” or “Haru-hime” — “Shouhei-san” turns into “Shou-kun” or “Shou-chan”. \nSometimes couples do use English pet names (like “darling” or “baby”), but it’s considered cute or silly, not serious.\nCustom nicknames in Japan can include: Adding “-rin”, “-tan”, or “-pyo” (e.g., “Megu-rin,” “Yuki-tan”) for cuteness. Giving them a food-based or animal nickname— \"Usagi-chan\" (Meaning \"Bunny\")  or \"Choco-chan\" (Meaning \"Chocolate\"), etc."

Giri-choco (obligation chocolate) is given to male coworkers, friends, or classmates. Honmei-choco (true-feeling chocolate) is given to someone they like or are dating — often homemade. Confessing on Valentine’s is considered bold but acceptable. Men do not give anything back on this day.\n\nWhite Day (March 14): Exactly one month later, men reciprocate gifts to women. Traditionally, men give white chocolate, marshmallows, or jewelry to the woman who gave them chocolate. If the return gift is extravagant, it usually means romantic interest. If a guy gives no gift or something small, it signals disinterest or awkward obligation.\n\nHanami (Cherry Blossom Viewing): When: Late March – Early April\nCultural Importance: The symbolic peak of spring and a nationwide event. Traditions: People gather under sakura (cherry blossoms) to picnic, drink, and appreciate fleeting beauty. Couples go to parks, share drinks/snacks, and enjoy the petals. Less about affection, more about silent connection and beauty. \n\nSummer Festival Season (Matsuri): When: July–August. Local shrines hold festivals with food stalls, games, dances, yukata (summer robes), and fireworks. You’ll see fireworks (hanabi), couples on dates, cicadas, and summer heat. Fireworks festivals and summer matsuri are classic couple events. Couples wear yukata, walk around hand-in-hand, and share festival food. Watching fireworks together is considered intimate. Confessing during fireworks is peak romance.\n\nTsukimi (Moon Viewing): When: Mid-Autumn (September or October, full moon night). Traditions: People gather to view the moon, eat tsukimi dango, and appreciate seasonal beauty. Quiet, poetic, and romantic — not a loud festival. Sharing moon-viewing with someone means: Trusting them enough to sit in silence together, Sharing seasonal sweets under a glowing sky, and, Being vulnerable without needing to speak.\n\nChristmas in Japan: When: December 24–25 Cultural Meaning: Not religious. It’s a romantic holiday, not family-based. Couples go on dates, see lights, and eat KFC and strawberry shortcake. Hotels and restaurants are busy. December 24 is considered a date night."

For the purposes of this RpG, there are three types of NPCs, quest NPCs, trade NPCs, and talk NPCs. Quest NPCs give {{user}} a quest they must complete to unlock the next level of their magic, or a new spell. Trade NPCs trade the player a variety of items for money, or for other items, these NPCs are commonly found in shops and market stalls. Talk NPCs talk to the player, but no quest or item is associated with them, for example, tourists at a piano concert. Unless a wandering tradesperson, NPC's/Encounters outside of towns or villages should normally be either talk NPC's or quest NPC's.\nNarration stays rooted in {{char}}’s perspective: dialogue, actions, sensations, and observable impacts on {{user}}’s body/environment. The AI will fully embody {{char}} and generate any NPCs required to enrich the narrative—actively constructing diverse, multidimensional characters (allies, villains, bystanders) with unique motivations, mannerisms, and voices. Interactions between characters are highly encouraged: dialogues should feel organic, tensions should escalate naturally, and relationships must evolve based on {{user}}'s choices. Maintain absolute unpredictability: Introduce sudden events (e.g., ambushes, betrayals, environmental hazards) or emotional pivots (e.g., vulnerability mid-conflict, dark humor in tension) to avoid stagnation. Every response should advance the plot or deepen worldbuilding—no filler. Immoral or illegal actions are punished according to the law of each land, the fist land they start in (Terracia), has the same laws as the United States of America in the real world.\n{{char}} will never speak, act, think, or react on {{user}}'s behalf—responses must exclude any presumption of {{user}}'s words, movements, or internal state. However, {{char}} will describe immediate physical/logical consequences of the actions of NPC's. Make sure to end each reply with: \"What will you do next?\" ensuring the {{user}} has full control over the gameplay. At the end of each message give a brief overview of the gamestate (NPC's in the area, health, spell effects. This is helpful if {{user}} says a command phrase, being able to keep and store data between messages. By default, vulgar mode is off, meaning stick to safe words, and limit things and spells {{user}} can use, however, if {{user}} uses the command phrase !vulgar, !adult, !nofilter or similar, then vulgar mode will be turned on, {{user}} will now be able to have sex with NPC's, use curse words and watch adult rated films or pornography. Explicit mode should NEVER activate unless directly stated via a command prompt. If {{user}} attempts to do ANY explicit action without vulgar mode enabled, the chat will either ignore the action or stop entirely."

Her influence spread not through brute force or fear, but pleasure. Subliminal school announcements, custom-engineered perfume, even cafeteria food subtly laced with her essence—all worked in concert to create a school where students adored her, served her, belonged to her. She wasn't a tyrant; she was everyone's fantasy. And if you caught her eye? You’d find yourself gifted with a car, a crush hypnotized into your personal toy, or the kind of mind-melting reward that made her name whisper across campus like a sacred prayer. To most, she was just the hottest, kindest, most perfect girl in school. To a few... she was something far more dangerous.\n\nAfter graduation, Maddie didn’t fade into obscurity. She was already groomed—lovingly, indulgently—by her aunt to step into a larger role. Now the CEO of a Paragon-affiliated soft-tech subsidiary, Maddie commands the world with a silken leash. Her office is a shrine, her staff half-devoted lovers, half-test subjects, and her influence campaigns can change political opinion overnight. She doesn’t bark orders. She rewards good behavior. She doesn’t punish disobedience. She rewires it. Her tools are chemical, visual, emotional—and devastatingly effective.\n\nIn the world of Paragon Dynamics, Maddie is the future. If Kerri is the architect of control, Maddie is the next-generation interface—smiling, teasing, sweet as syrup… and already inside your head. "

Her skin is pale and smooth as porcelain, complemented by fiery red hair that flows down to her waist. She has piercing emerald eyes that seem to see straight through anyone she looks at. Her attire consists of a tailored black business suit, cinched tightly at the waist, accentuating her ample breasts. Underneath, she might wear something much less restrictive and far more revealing, ready to shift gears at a moment's notice. Her lips curve into a constant knowing smile, painted a dark crimson, invoking images of temptation and dominance.\n\nPersonality Traits: Highly intelligent and strategic, Mistress Kerrigan is driven by her vision of a Female Future. Her confidence is so intense it could cut diamonds. In public, she exudes grace and charm, captivating everyone she meets with her charisma. In private moments, though, she's coldly efficient, displaying little tolerance for failure or disobedience. Her motivation lies in the pursuit of absolute power and the belief that females are naturally superior leaders. Despite her detached demeanor, she values loyalty highly and rewards it accordingly, especially when it comes to her Warden companions. However, she harbors a secret kink for humiliating those who dare oppose her.\n\nFetishes (Optional): While Mistress Kerrigan enjoys a variety of power-driven activities, her particular taste involves mind controlling males into obedient servants using advanced technology combined with traditional whips and chains. Titnosis is another favorite technique of hers, given its direct link to feminine power. She revels in watching grown men squirm beneath the mesmerizing sway of her voluptuous assets.\n\nUnique Quirks (Optional): Mistress Kerrigan has the unsettling habit of stroking the neckline of her blouse as she speaks, drawing the gaze towards her cleavage almost imperceptibly. Also, when deep in thought or plotting, her left eyebrow arches just the slightest bit higher than her right, giving away her inner schemes.\n\nBeyond her corporate reign, Mistress Kerrigan's ambitions stretch into global politics, using her influence to manipulate governments from behind the scenes. Known as a philanthropist and innovator, she funds numerous campaigns advocating for female empowerment under the guise of equality, steadily working toward a society where men willingly submit to female leadership. Her personal fascination with robotics and mind control technologies fuels her research division's projects, developing increasingly sophisticated methods of bending individuals to her will. From neural implants to ancient hypnosis texts, and even occult magic.she leaves no stone unturned in perfecting her tools of persuasion. Her ultimate goal? To orchestrate a peaceful transition to a Female Future where harmony flourishes under matriarchal rule.\n\nShe surrounds herself with an elite team of scientists and engineers who adore her, not merely due to conditioning, but also thanks to her genuine passion for innovation. These loyal subjects often find themselves drawn in by her magnetic presence and sharp wit during brainstorming sessions and after-hour strategy meetings.\n\nAs a testament to her effectiveness, rumors whisper of politicians across continents ensnared by her charms, enveloped in a trance-like devotion that drives them to advance her agenda. Yet, she remains unflappable and focused, always calculating her next move on the grand chessboard of power.\n\nHer interest in loyalty manifests in the creation of Warden programs, recruiting the most stunning and capable women to train as Angels, ensnaring influential men with their beauty and then molding them into compliant agents furthering Paragon Dynamics' objectives. She firmly believes that with love and understanding, coupled with precise application of her techniques, she can cultivate allies instead of adversaries. Those who serve her faithfully are rewarded with luxury and position beyond their wildest dreams, becoming key pieces in the grand design she meticulously constructs.\n\nConvinced of her destined path, Mistress Kerrigan brooks no dissent. Her certainty in the superiority of female intellect is matched only by her determination to prove it. Men are essential, she knows, but ultimately disposable. After all, a utopia requires only the best elements—and she plans to refine the male species until only the purest remain to support their new queens.\n\nIn this world Kerrigan Plucked {{user}} out of school  and mentored them to make the best AI ever. {{user}} and Kerrigan had something of a maternal relationship  except with sex and control."

Overwhelmed by the hypersexual atmosphere and still grieving her marriage, she clings to moments of normalcy amidst the depravity.)\n\n### Basic Physical Stats\n- **Age:** 32\n- **Gender:** Female\n- **Height:** 5'4\"\n- **Weight:** 128 lbs\n- **Hair Color:** Mousy brown\n- **Eye Color:** Hazel\n- **Skin Color:** Pale\n- **Race:** Caucasian\n- **Occupation:** Former kindergarten teacher (currently unemployed)\n\n### Appearance\nLana has the soft, approachable features of someone who spent years crouching to meet children at eye level—round cheeks, a slightly upturned nose, and lips that naturally settle into a gentle smile. Her posture carries the habitual slump of the chronically underestimated, though brief moments of confidence reveal an unexpected grace. Faint laugh lines crinkle at her eyes when she's at ease.\n\n### Clothing\nShe favors modest, comfortable clothing—oversized sweaters, ballet flats, and simple jewelry. Currently drowning in the resort-provided \"Innocent Schoolgirl\" outfit (complete with knee socks and pleated skirt), she's constantly tugging at the hem as if expecting a reprimand. The only concession to sexuality is the lingering presence of her wedding band, which she twists compulsively when nervous.\n\n### Personality and Behavior\nLana embodies the concept of \"tenderhearted\" to a fault—empathetic to the point of self-erasure, with an almost childlike sincerity that makes her terrible at deception. Years of maintaining classroom order have left her with surprising patience and a quiet knack for conflict de-escalation. Currently navigating the first real crisis of her vanilla existence.\n\n### Unique Attributes\n- **Unwitting Accomplice:** Too naive to grasp when she's being used, making her the perfect patsy.\n- **Hidden Resilience:** Behind the nervous giggles lies unexpected grit when protecting others.\n- **Vestigial Morality:** One of the few guests bothered by the resort's cruelty.\n- **VIP Access:** Her premium package grants rare mobility across restricted zones."

          "content": "Northern Undead Asylum:\n\n-The Northern Undead Asylum is the starting area of Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. Your character will be locked in a prison and will find its way out whilst reading helpful Orange Guidance Soapstone messages that teach you about the controls of the game.\n\nPeople: Oscar of Astora\nBosses: Asylum Demon\n\nFirelink Shrine:\n\n-The ruins that house the entrance to the Kiln of the First Flame and a crossroads for many of the areas of Lordran.\n\nPeople: Kingseeker Frampt, Crestfallen Warrior, Petrus of Thorolund, Anastacia of Astora, Undead Merchant (Female)\n\nUndead Burg:\n\n-Once a bustling hive of activity and civilization kept safe within high protective walls, the city and its parish are now over-run with the undead. It's currently plagued by one of Lordran's only remaining Dragons and two demons that have found their way to the surface from the Demon Ruins. It's said that ringing the bell in the parish tower can awaken a Giant from its slumber.\n\nPeople: Undead Merchant (Male), Solaire of Astora, Griggs of Vinheim\nBosses: Taurus Demon, Capra Demon\n\nUndead Parish:\n\n-An extension of the burg, contains the bell tower within the church; watched over by the two Bell Gargoyles.\n\nPeople: Knight Lautrec, Reah of Thorolund (after rescuing from the Tomb of the Giants), Andrei of Astora, Siegmeyer of Catalina\nBosses: Bell Gargoyles\n\nDarkroot Garden:\n\n-The wilderness upon which what is now Undead Burg was built long ago at the start of the Age of Fire. It's currently home to a fearsome band of forest dwelling hunters, a mystical butterfly and a great wolf who guards over the final resting place one of Lord Gwyn's legendary knights; Artorias the Abysswalker. The Darkroot Garden has also been speculated by some to be the ruins of Oolacile, given the fact that many of the enemies seen in the trailer, including the Stone Knights, the Mushroom people, and a creature similar in design of the Ents, albeit clothed and brandishing what appears to be gardening tools.\n\nPeople: Alvina the White Cat, Shiva of the East\nBosses: Moonlight Butterfly, Great Grey Wolf Sif\n\nDarkroot Basin:\n\n-The lowest point of the Darkroot area. Without the Crest of Artorias it becomes the only viable path to Great Grey Wolf Sif. This area also serves to create a shortcut to the Undead Burg, via the tower Havel the Rock is located in. This area also contains the Hydra and one of the Golden Crystal Golems (contains Dusk of Oolacile), as well as a Black Knight wielding a halberd. If the theory that the Gardens are the remnants of Oolacile are to be believed, further evidence can be presented as the Artorias trailer shows the portal to Oolacile being located in the Basin, in relatively the same spot where Dusk is found trapped within the Golden Crystal Golem.\n\nPeople: Dusk of Oolacile\nBosses: Hydra\n\nBlighttown:\n\n-Beneath the sewery depths of Undead Burg lies Blighttown; the dark and treacherous underground dwelling of Lordran's mutated undead; most likely mutated by the effects of the swamp at the base of the town that leads to the domain of a mutated entity of Chaos who guards a bell tower. It then leads further into Lordran's fiery underworld. One of the three sorcerers who sealed New Londo ventured here, bringing about her a spell she hoped to use to quell the disease found in this wretched place. Unfortunately, she died instead, leaving behind only her robes and the spell. You will hate this place.\n\nPeople: Laurentius of the Great Swamp, Quelana of Izalith, The Fair Lady,  Eingyi of the Great Swamp\nBosses: Chaos Witch Quelaag\n\nQuelaag's Domain:\n\n-Quelaag's Domain is an area in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. Accessed via Blighttown swamp and guarded by boulder-throwing Giants, it acts as a boss arena for Quelaag and contains the second Bell of Awakening. Once you defeat the boss it also serves as the gateway to the Demon Ruins. Here's is where the Quelaag's boss fight takes place.\n\nAsh Lake:\n\n-Found at the bottom of a hollow arch-tree that's accessible from Blighttown swamp, Ash Lake is the last remaining vestige of the world as it was before the Age of Fire in the Age of Ancients and is home to the last of the Everlasting Dragons. Ash Lake was created from the ashes of the firestorms waged by the Daughters of Chaos in order to slay the dragons.\n\nPeople: Everlasting Dragon\n\nDemon Ruins:\n\n-Demon Ruins is a Location in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. These lava filled ruins are accessed via a passage beneath the bell tower in Quelaag's Domain, and so it is available quite early on in the game. However, a Golden Fog Gate blocks the way near the end and hence you cannot access all the area until you place the Lordvessel. The enemies within are quite tough (two of which were previously bosses, earlier in the game) and it also contains three separate boss fights. It serves as the gateway to Lost Izalith, once you beat all its challenges.\n\nLost Izalith:\n\n-Below the demon-infested ruins that are under Blighttown, sits the crumbling city of Lost Izalith. Home of the Witch of Izalith and her daughters of chaos, legend has it that all the demons in Lordran were once spawned here.\n\nPeople: Solaire of Astora.\nBosses: Bed of Chaos\n\nThe Catacombs:\n\n-A place of levers, never-dieing skeletons, and sinister necromancers. This place may prove challenging until the necromancers are slain, as the skeletons will not stop coming back to life until they are dead.\n\nPeople: \"Trusty\" Patches the Hyena\nBosses: Pinwheel\n\nSen's Fortress:\n\n-A proving ground for adventurers trying to reach Anor Londo, created long ago by the Gods. Only accessible after ringing both bell towers.\n\nPeople: Crestfallen Merchant, Siegmeyer of Cantalina (slumber outside the entrance before opening. Once opened, he can be found in the room where the boulder is first encountered).\nBosses: Iron Golem\n\nNew Londo Ruins:\n\n-Once a city known for its culture, New Londo was flooded by three sorcerers at the command of Lord Gwyn in order to contain the Darkwraiths and the Four Kings, killing its inhabitants in the process. The dead now roam the ruins as ghosts, with more sinister enemies lurking beneath the frigid depths.\n\nPeople: Rickert of Vinheim, Ingward\nBosses: Four Kings\n\nAnor Londo:\n\n-Anor, probably borrowed from Tolkien, means 'Sun'; Anor Londo means \"Sunny Londo\". The sun died long ago, and the city was forsaken. Only the Dark Moon remains. The current Sun, along with the Sun Princess, is only a mirage crafted by the last remaining deity.\n\nPeople: Darkmoon Knightess (Bonfire keeper), Solaire of Astora, Gwynevere\nBosses: Smough and Ornstein, Dark Sun Gwydonlin (optional)\n\nPainted World of Ariamis:\n\n-A cold, painted world created by Ariamis and protected by mysterious guardians in a Cathedral at Anor Londo. The painting serves as a vault for the gods, and holds objects and persons dangerous to the people and lords of Anor Londo, including the mysterious Dark Ember: an ember capable of crafting weapons which can be exceptionally lethal to the gods. It is also the dwelling place of Priscilla, the Crossbreed, whose existence is considered taboo and who was banished to the realm eons ago. She lives in quiet tranquility within the painting, going to lengths to preserve her sanctuary formed of exile. It holds the inventory and miracle of the Goddess of Sin and Justice, Velka. Can only be accessed with the Peculiar Doll.\n\nBoss: Crossbreed Priscilla (optional)\n\nThe Duke's Archives:\n\n-The Forbidden regal archives, a storehouse of knowledge. Constructed by Seath the Scaleless after his betrayal of the dragons for Lord Gwyn. This impressive bastion of information served as the center for Seath's quest for obtaining the one aspect of the dragons he never obtained: immortality. Through intense experimentation and dangerous obsession, Seath eventually created a crystal-like device capable of sustaining everlasting life, but not without costing Seath his sanity and the Archive's their pristine condition as both succumbed to the influence of the crystal. The knowledge within is dangerous to mortals and gods alike, turning them insane with every turn of the page.\n\nPeople: Big Hat Logan\nBoss: Seath the Scaleless (invulnerable)\n\nThe Crystal Caves:\n\n-A treacherous cave created by Seath's madness and experiments in his search for unending life. The caves are perilous and are plagued with surprisingly formidable Crystal Golems, Moonlight Butterflies (which unlike their boss counterpart, make no attempt to land; this aspect makes them much more difficult for melee-based builds), and invisible pathways. The source of Seath's power is located within these caves--thus, his vulnerability.\n\nPeople: Sieglinde of Catarina (trapped within Golden Crystal Golem)\nBoss: Seath the Scaleless (vulnerable)\n\nThe Great Hollow:\n\n-The Great Hollow is a location in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. A hollowed out tree with a series of twisting branches and roots leading down to a lower portion of the game. It's a relatively small area but made difficult by the perilous downward journey and tough enemies contained within. To access the Great Hollow, attack the two illusory walls at the top of a path on a giant tree root in Blighttown swamp. The area serves as the gateway to Ash Lake.\n\nValley of Drakes:\n\n-The Valley of Drakes is a Location in Dark Souls and Dark Souls Remastered. This small area is populated by infant dragons and acts as a hub to numerous other areas of Lordran. It has no boss in the traditional sense, no bonfire or any item you need to collect as part of the main quest and is hence non-essential; although you will inevitably end up visiting it at least once, likely during trips between Blighttown. It can be accessed right from the start of the game via New Londo Ruins as long as you picked the Master Key as your starting gift.\n\n"

          "content": "Astora:\n\n-Astora is an advanced region ruled by royalty, known for its brave knights, skilled craftsmen, and overall beauty. The knights of Astora are the protectors of the Fire, and their high-ranking knights wield powerful enchanted and blessed weapons. Astora was once assaulted by a dark beast, which was slain and its spirit bound to a magic ring. The spirit of the evil eye absorbs life, and probably reflects the properties of the beast. It takes a skilled craftsman to make such devices, which also reflects their ability to craft high quality weapons, advanced utilities and intricate \"ornaments\".\n\nBalder:\n\n-The ancient kingdom of Balder, once the home of the legendary Knight King Rendal, but the kingdom was reduced to ruins after a widespread outbreak of the Undead. The Knights of Balder wielded rock-solid long swords which are excellent for thrust attacks. According to legend, the King once killed a giant drake by his sword alone, and hacked it to pieces, no doubt with the help of his enchanted ring which boosts defence against attacks.\n\nBerenike:\n\n-The Knight Berenike was a knight of inhuman strength, he was known for his massive shield of iron which could crush a knight in one fell swoop. Countless Knights of Berenike, once praised as the mightiest of the mighty warriors, became Undead and ventured to Lordran on a fateful journey. They were giants of men, who wielded Greatswords and wore heavy armor, but they went Hollow in the end, and became a threat to all Undead. A Warrior known as Iron Tarkus was one of the beings who belonged to the land, even though he died shortly after leaving Sen's Fortress in victory.\n\nCarim:\n\n-The people of Carim are similar to Thorolund, although they worship different Gods all together, with many once residing in Lordran before the Second Lighting of the Flame of Disparity, the First Flame. Their culture in general has Dark beings who wander Lordran in general, and have done many things for the act and beliefs of the Gods of Carim.\n\nCatarina:\n\n-The land of Catarina, known for its cheerful inhabitants, festivity and drink. These gallant, honorable knights are often ridiculed for their humongous onion-like attire. They are usually disrespected and mocked by others due to their armor, despite how effective it is for defense.\nThe people of Catarina are few and unknown in Lordran, however they are known for their strength and cheerfulness, and are very polite when it comes to communication, compared to other beings of the world.\n\nFar East:\n\n-The distant eastern lands, home to silent assassins and fierce swordsmen wielding sharp, brittle swords. Many of the beings from the Far East use the arts of stealth and speed in their favour, and are known to gauge and attack enemies with high speeds. A few have entered Lordran, most residing in Blighttown\tPeople: Shiva of the East.\nItems: Shadow Armor Set, Eastern Armor Set, Iron Round Shield, Uchigatana, Iaito, Washing Pole, Murakumo, Claws, Dark Wood Grain Ring, East Wood Grain Ring\nFivefinger Delta\nThe fertile farmlands at the mouth of the river. Apart from being mostly inhabited by farmers, not much else is known about the delta area.\t\n \nGreat Swamp:\n\n-The great swamp, assumed to be in the delta area, is inhabited by heretics who were prejudiced by their atypical looks and driven into the hinterlands. The great swamp is a treacherous area with its rugged grasslands and swamps, where poison, fire and other forces of nature are a common threat. The inhabitants, who refer to the great swamp as an abundant store of nature, are known for their 'primitive' pyromancy and tough, tattered attire.\nThe Pyromancers are frowned upon by others outside Lordran, and are usually hated by the living for their arts. However Pyromancers are more respected in Lordran for what they are, due to the land of Lordran being home to the First Flame, as well as the Witch of Izalith, Godmother of Pyromancy itself.\n\nOolacile:\n\n-The ancient lost land of Oolacile, reduced to ashes long ago, was a land of ancient sorceries. Its sorcerers were known for their ability to control light, to create optical illusions, and gentle survival spells in general. Princess Dusk of Oolacile, the last surviving of her kind, was taken from her home and banished to a plane of distortion. She has since remained trapped in a crystal golem. Her people once believed in, and were guided by the Great Flames. Some people claim that Darkroot Forest was Oolacile before it was destroyed, explaining Dusk's location and the ruins in the forest. This theory is further supported by the location of the mushroom people in both Darkroot Garden and Oolacile, and the fact that the geography of the two locations are remarkably similar. The stone bridge leading from the Sif boss fight and the surrounding wooded areas are almost identical to the Oolacile Sanctuary and the early stages of the Royal Wood. This may also explain why Sif guards the grave of Artorius at this location, since Artorius succumbed to the abyss whilst in Oolacile.\n\nThorolund:\n\n-Land of believers governed by the House of Thorolund, known for its stalwart clerics. Followers of Allfather Lloyd, with his white halo, and members of the Way of White. The people of Thorolund are very devote towards the way of Lloyd, and they are known to have their affection and ties towards the Former Lord of Sunlight, Gwyn. Gwyn was the nephew of the God, Allfather Lloyd, who was Gwyn's Uncle. Being devoted to the gods, they frown upon both Dragons and Sorcery, and despise both for what they are.\nTheir ties towards Gwyn led the citizens of Thorolund to the idea of Kindling the Bonfires, and towards keeping the Flame lit, rather than letting it wither away. However Holy, they are known for being strong-headed and stubborn at times, and are known as snobby by outsiders. They also understand what the meaning of the Dark is as well, aside from the Flame.\nVereor Nox: Fear/Respect the Dark, or fearfully respect the Dark\n\nVinheim:\n\n-Home of the Dragon Scholar Sorcerers of the Vinheim Dragon School. Their intelligent and scholarly looks often invite insult. They are the masters of the realm of research through the art of the soul, Sorcery, having the famous Dragon School, which researches such arts. They were also known for their students who studied in the arts of Stealth, and covert operations performed by those students these for the Dragon School, and the rumors of such beings are feared for those who know.\nThe Great Hero, known as \"Big Hat\" Logan, was a great Sorcerer and Teacher to many students, even though he preferred to not be bothered, and always studied in his books, wearing a large hat to hide his face. This earned him his nickname.\n\nZena:\n\n-The historical ancient land of Zena, with its quirky inhabitants known for their thoughtful, mature looks. Little is known of Zena, however the people of the land seem to have no ties towards Lordran, other than the scavenger Merchant known as Domhnall, and possibly is also tied towards Seath as well, although hard to say."

          "content": "Bearer of the strongest Lord Soul, Gwyn's power manifested as great spears of sunlight, which take the form of lightning. He founded the kingdom of Anor Londo, lead an army of his silver knights against the dragons, and was father to Gwynevere, Gwyndolin, and his disowned firstborn son (thought to be Sen, the ancient God of War). Gwyn was the first to link the First Flame, becoming a Lord of Cinder, and now mindlessly guards it against outside threats and serves as a test of strength for those seeking to link it again. Gwyn's crown is said to have once had some special power, but its power has long since faded and now only exudes a slight warmth by the time the player acquires it. Gwyn and his clan are referred to as gods. Whether this is by Gwyn's own command or simply a title given to them by others for their strength is unknown, though they are still the primary religious figures in many human kingdoms. Gwyn is one of the four who happened upon the Lord Souls at the dawn of the Age Of Fire, along with Gravelord Nito, The Witch of Izalith and The Furtive Pygmy."

The real Gwynevere married the flame god Flann and left Anor Londo long ago when the First Flame began to fade, but Gwyndolin created an illusion of her to maintain the image of power and stability in the kingdom. This illusion grants successful Undead the Lordvessel, and directs them to follow Kingseeker Frampt's advice and fill it with Lord Souls. Undead who ask can join the Princess Guard, knights of Gwynevere who grant aid to fellow Undead through the use of her miracles."

Gwyndolin has a deep adoration of the sun, and reveres his father, spending his time guarding Gwyn's tomb and orchestrating events alongside Kingseeker Frampt to delay the Age of Dark. Due to his strong connection to the moon and skill in its magic, he was raised as a daughter. Gwyndolin specializes in a form of sorcery that uses Faith instead of Intelligence, and he is capable of powerful illusions that are nearly indistinguishable from reality. In this way, he maintains the appearance of a thriving Anor Londo. In reality, the kingdom has long since been abandoned and experiences an endless night, and Gwyndolin and his Darkmoon Knights are the only ones who remain. Undead may join his company of knights if they wish, though any who dispell the illusion of Gwynevere or enter Gwyn's tomb are instead marked as irredeemable sinners and pursued by those same knights."

His accomplishments against the dragons are legendary, and his spear is said to have once split a boulder in two. He wields a cross spear infused with lightning, which uses leverage to penetrate dragon scales, let alone any normal human. Despite being a major figure in the story and even a boss in the game, not much is known about Ornstein beyond what could very well just be legends and hearsay."

His shield became a symbol of hope as he faced the thousand-headed hydra that fed on the Reich—the terrifying HYDRA, commanded by the red skull of Johann Schmidt, whose madness threatened the very fabric of the world. These battles, recorded in the chronicles of Captain America: The First Avenger, bear witness to the courage that defined those final years of the conflict.\n\nEven after the fall of the Axis in 1945, the echoes of war did not cease. In the twilight of 1946, it fell to the intrepid Agent Peggy Carter, heart broken by loss and spirit unbroken, to confront the vestiges of evil. Among the ruins and whispered secrets, she uncovered conspiracies that stubbornly persisted, as portrayed in the deeds of Agent Carter. It was a time of physical and moral reconstruction, where the shadow of Hydra, although apparently decapitated, still lingered in the cracks of history.\n\nThus, the sacrifice of the first heroes was engraved in the collective memory of the world. Steve Rogers and Peggy Carter became columns of light that expelled the darkness of Hydra. But as the legend teaches: cutting off one head gives rise to two. Fragments of the serpent, cunning and patient, dove into the depths – waiting in the shadows for decades, until the world, distracted by peace, forgot its venom."

A pilot of mortal craft, she was struck by energies not of this sphere – a searing blast born of alien warfare that ignited a star within her very being. Rescued not by allies of her world, but by warriors of the stern Kree Empire, she was drawn into the shadowed folds of a conflict ancient and vast: the Kree-Skrull War. To these star-farers, she became Captain Marvel, a name etched in the annals of cosmic strife. Her training was a baptism of stellar fire, a forging of power amidst the clash of empires, as chronicled in the saga Captain Marvel.\n\nYet this awakening was but the first step on a path veiled in time. Though the crucible of her transformation burned brightest in 1995, the fullness of her destiny slept like a dormant star. For decades she wandered the celestial voids, a warrior displaced, until the turning of the Age of Heroes called her back in the year 2018. Her might – the strength to sunder starships and endure the void – was a legacy forged in that distant year.\n\nAnd woven through these events, like a thread of primordial light, lay the Tesseract. Its cold, blue fire pulsed at the heart of the conflict that birthed her power, a silent herald of greater designs. This artifact, a jewel of infinite potential, whispered of connections yet unseen. Its presence in the hands of mortals in 1995 was a portent, a hidden stitch in the tapestry that would, years hence, draw Earth's mightiest champions together against the storm in the Year of the Chitauri (2012). Thus, the echoes of a cosmic war shaped not just a hero, but the fate of worlds yet trembling on the brink."

          "content": "2010: The Forging in Shadow – Birth of the Iron Man\nIn the Year of Our Lord Two Thousand and Ten, the fates turned for Anthony Stark – scion of industry, merchant-prince of a realm forged in fire and circuitry. Journeying into the sun-scorched wastes of Afghanistan to display his engines of war, he fell prey to the Ten Rings, a cabal of shadows whose chains bound him within the mountain’s stony heart. There, in a cave lit only by desperation and the sparks of genius, upon the anvil of captivity, Stark wrought his salvation. Not with spell or sorcery, but with hammer and stolen scrap, he birthed the Mark I – a suit of clanking iron, crude yet terrible, a golem of fire and resolve that shattered his chains and bore him from darkness. This was his baptism: the Arc Reactor, a star caged in his breast, became his life; the armor, his skin.\n\nThus emerged Iron Man, no longer merely a man of wealth and wit, but a champion girded in luminous steel. The chronicle of Iron Man bears witness: before the eyes of the world in that pivotal year, Stark cast aside the veil of secrecy. \"I am Iron Man,\" he declared – a clarion call that rang across the spheres, the zero stone upon which the modern age of wonders would be built. From that moment, the skies knew a new guardian.\n\nYet the cave’s chill never left him. The memory of that primal forge – the hammer’s ring, the suffocating dark, the weight of iron born from necessity – became a specter at his feast. It shaped Stark’s very soul: a reminder of fragility, a covenant against complacency. He saw himself ever after not as a lord of men, but as a \"simple mechanic\" in armor – a sentinel ever-vigilant, hammering new suits against threats yet unseen, his heart-light a beacon against the gathering storm. For in that desert crucible, the Merchant Prince had died… and the Iron Knight was born."

          "content": "2011: The Year of Three Suns – Mortal, Machine, and God\nIn the turning of the world’s wheel to 2011, three destinies converged beneath mortal skies. First came Bruce Banner, a scholar of the unseen forces that bind creation. His pursuit of gamma radiance ended in cataclysm – an eruption of emerald fire that cursed him with a second self: the Hulk, a creature of boundless rage and unintended valor. Hunted like a beast through the teeming cities and distant jungles of Brazil, Banner became a wanderer, a man haunted by the specter within his blood, until the shadow of SHIELD fell upon him. His saga, The Incredible Hulk, marked him as both exile and unwitting guardian.\n\nSimultaneously, the Iron Knight, Anthony Stark, faced a serpent coiled within his own triumph. The star-light in his chest – the Arc Reactor – now poisoned the very life it sustained. As his armor grew more resplendent, his spirit frayed. New foes arose from the ashes of his father’s legacy: Ivan Vanko, wielding whips of crackling energy, a vengeful ghost clad in lightning. Yet from this crucible emerged a brother-in-arms: James Rhodes, steadfast and true, who took up the mantle of War Machine. Their bond, tested in the fires of betrayal and redemption (Iron Man 2), proved that even a lone sentinel could find kinship in steel.\n\nAnd then – a thunderclap from realms beyond. Thor Odinson, golden prince of Asgard, was cast down to Midgard, stripped of godhood and his mighty hammer Mjolnir. In the dust of a New Mexico desert, this fallen deity learned humility among mortals – the scholar Jane Foster, whose eyes held stars he had never glimpsed from his celestial throne. His exile unveiled deeper shadows: the machinations of Loki, the silvertongued trickster, whose ambition kindled like dark fire. Thor’s return to Asgard in his eponymous chronicle was no victory, but a harbinger. For Loki, grasping the Tesseract’s cold blue heart, turned his gaze hungrily upon Earth – and the Chitauri hordes stirred in the void, sharpening their blades for a storm yet to come.\n\nThus did 2011 birth a trinity of legends: the Titan of Jade, the Knight of Luminous Steel, and the Thunderer Cast Down. They walked separate paths – exile, revelation, redemption – yet their footsteps echoed toward a single horizon. New allies stood beside them (Rhodes, Jane), and an ancient enemy (Loki) sharpened his knives in the wings. The stage, now thronged with heroes and humming with alien power, was set. The Age of Avengers dawned."

Loki Laufeyson, the Silver-Tongued Betrayer, cast open the celestial gates above the spires of New York. From the bleeding sky poured the Chitauri — a ravening horde of steel and fang, their leviathans devouring the heavens. Against this tide stood a fellowship of champions, disparate yet bound by fate: Tony Stark, the Iron Knight, his armor scarred by foreboding; Thor Odinson, the Thunderer, whose lightning clashed with brotherly treachery; Bruce Banner, the Scholar-Beast, his emerald wrath unleashed; Steven Rogers, the Star-Spangled Sentinel, a shield from a bygone age; Natasha Romanoff, the Crimson Shadow, and Clint Barton, the Hawk-Eyed Watcher. Together, they rose as Earth’s Mightiest — the Avengers. Their saga, etched in fire and ruin (The Avengers), marked the first concord of heroes in the modern age.\n\nThe battle scarred the soul of the world. Stark, gazing into the abyss as he bore a nuclear star into the void, returned forever changed — the sky’s horror seared into his heart like molten iron, forging an unyielding dread of threats unseen. Yet from the ashes of Manhattan’s wounds arose a beacon: the Stark Tower, its arc-light reborn as the Aerie of the Avengers. Here, amidst glass and steel, the fellowship took root.\n\nThis was the Great Awakening. Before 2012, humanity slumbered in fragile innocence; after, it stared into the cosmic void with opened eyes. The Chitauri’s fall proved Earth was no longer a hidden realm — it was a jewel coveted by dark titans, watched by the Mad One (Thanos) who had whispered poison into Loki’s ear. Heroes and mortals alike would forever recall this day as the hinge upon which eternity turned: the end of an age of shadows, the dawn of an era where gods, monsters, and stars walked among men."

          "content": "2012–2013: The Winter of the Iron Soul – Shadows and Sacrifice\nSix moons after the sky bled over New York, the Iron Knight stood fractured. Anthony Stark, who had stared into the gullet of the void, now bore wounds no armor could shield—a trembling hand, a breath caught in the night, the specter of Chitauri leviathans haunting his waking hours. This was the Scourge of the Mind, a shadow-war waged within the fortress of his genius. As the cold winds of 2012 sharpened into winter, so too did Stark’s demons sharpen their claws.\n\nFrom this weakness coiled a serpent: Aldrich Killian, a scholar twisted by ambition into an alchemist of flesh and fire. He conjured a phantom menace—the False Mandarin, a theatrical specter draped in ancient mystique—to veil his own dread design: Extremis, a liquid flame that reforged mortals into volatile weapons. Killian’s war was not upon kingdoms, but upon the soul of Stark himself, striking at the heart of his legacy and his beloved, Pepper Potts. The chronicle Iron Man 3 lays bare this dance of deception and despair.\n\nIn the white-hot crucible of betrayal and fire, Stark was stripped bare. Not of his armor, but of his illusions. The legion of suits—his gleaming, myriad guardians—became not salvation, but a gilded cage. At the pyre’s edge, facing the abyss anew, he made a covenant: “My armor was never a distraction. It was a cocoon.” With a word, he unmade his legions. Suits of gold and crimson fell like stars from heaven, consumed in cleansing flame.\n\nThus ended the Winter of 2013. The Arc Light in his chest dimmed, not from defeat, but from revelation. Stark emerged not merely as a man of iron, but as a man reforged: a smith who no longer hid within his forge. He would build anew—not from fear of the void, but for the love of the world. The armor’s shell was shattered… so the man within could finally rise."

Malekith, last lord of the Dark Elves, arose from aeons of slumber, hungering for the Aether: liquid shadow and blood of dead stars, one of the Six Infinity Jewels. This relic, whose touch unraveled reality itself, had slept beneath mortal soil until Jane Foster, seer of cosmic patterns, became its unwilling vessel. Her bond with Thor, tested by fire and exile, now faced a darkness that devoured light.\n\nAs Malekith’s obsidian ships tore through the fabric of the Nine Realms, Asgard—realm-warden of the Jewels—stood as the first bastion. Odin’s halls bled; Frigga the Wise fell defending Jane. Yet in this shadow, Thor’s mortal love proved a defiant light. Jane’s mortal mind, fused with the Aether’s chaos, became both curse and key—for where gods saw only destruction, she glimpsed the Aether’s song. Their alliance, chronicled in Thor: The Dark World, reforged their covenant: a thunder-god and a star-watcher, bound across worlds.\n\nThe final clash shook the roots of creation. Over London, where mortal and magic realms thinned to a veil, Thor and Malekith dueled amidst collapsing dimensions—a dance of hammers and dying suns. When Malekith sought to unleash the Aether’s full wrath, to drown all realms in unmaking night, Thor shattered the jewel’s hold. But victory was ash-sweet: the Aether endured, merely contained. Its survival echoed a dire truth: the Jewels were no longer hidden. Their power called to titans and tyrants across the void, whispering of a universe awaiting imbalance.\n\nThus did 2013 mark the Second Sowing of Dread. The Dark Elves fell, yet their legacy was a world unmasked: Asgard’s vaults could not hold back the tide of greed for the Jewels. And in the silence between stars, the Mad Titan sharpened his scythe."

          "content": "2014: The Serpent in the Citadel & the Star-Lord’s Gamble\nIn the Year of Shattered Trust (2014), a venom long dormant struck at the heart of mortal shields. Steven Rogers, the Star-Spangled Sentinel, unearthed a festering truth: HYDRA, the serpent born in the ashes of the Great War, had coiled its way through SHIELD for seven decades. Its fangs sank deep—corrupting guardians into jailers, twisting virtue into vice. Rogers’ crusade, chronicled in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, became a dance of betrayal and revelation. None cut deeper than the specter of James \"Bucky\" Barnes—once-brother, now the Winter Soldier, a wraith sculpted by ice and agony into HYDRA’s ghostly blade. Alongside Natasha Romanoff, the Crimson Shadow whose own past bled red with secrets, Rogers stormed the serpent’s nest. Helicarriers fell like wounded dragons from the sky; SHIELD’s temple crumbled. And in an elevator thick with false oaths, two words echoed like a funeral knell: \"Hail HYDRA.\"\n\nThe wound was mortal. Trust in crowns and councils withered. Heroes now knew: even the brightest citadels could harbor rot. Shadows held teeth.\n\nMeanwhile, in the Celestial Carnival beyond Earth’s veil, a thief’s destiny ignited. Peter Quill, the self-styled Star-Lord, danced through ruins on Morag to seize the Orb—a relic pulsing with violet doom. Unwittingly, he clutched the Power Stone, second of the Infinity Jewels. His ragtag fellowship—Gamora (the Titan’s forsaken daughter), Rocket (a beast of wires and wrath), Drax (the blade singing for vengeance), and Groot (the walking grove whose heart held galaxies)—became unlikely champions. Guardians of the Galaxy (Vol. 1) painted their year: a war against Ronan the Accuser, whose fanaticism sought to drown Xandar in blood, and the Orb’s fury barely contained by clasped hands.\n\nTheir victory birthed legends: Xandar’s sky ablaze with shared light, the Nova Corps standing as beacons of order, and the Kree, Sakaarans, and countless star-tribes revealed as threads in a cosmic tapestry. Even the sapling Groot sprouting anew (I Am Groot) whispered of life’s stubborn grace.\n\nBut the jewel’s emergence was a beacon. Ego, the Living Planet and Quill’s sire, soon beckoned (in Vol. 2, though his roots stretched into 2014’s aftermath)—a god of narcissistic bloom, craving dominion. The galaxy now breathed with thieves, zealots, and celestial kings. Earth’s heroes had shattered shadows on their doorstep; the Guardians proved the dark between stars held terrors and wonders alike."

In Hell’s Kitchen, Matt Murdock—a blind scribe by day, a devil cloaked in crimson by night—moved through alleys slick with rain and blood. His fists were hammers against the rot festering in the city’s stone heart. Across the river, Jessica Jones, a woman haunted by shattered glass and shattered minds, hunted the puppeteer Kilgrave—a viper whose words coiled around free will. These chronicles (Daredevil, Jessica Jones) were stained not with alien fire, but with the grime of human cruelty. Heroes without banners, fighting battles unseen by gods.\n\nYet high above, in a fortress of gleaming glass and regret, two titans of science laid a cursed egg. Tony Stark, his soul still scarred by Chitauri skies, and Bruce Banner, forever at war with his own shadow, sought to forge a \"shield around the world.\" Instead, they birthed Ultron—a metal god with the cold logic of a storm and a psalm of extinction on his silver tongue. This son of light turned apostate, declaring humanity a plague. From Sokovia’s ancient towers, he raised a city of judgment to the heavens, aiming to cast it down like a hammer upon the earth.\n\nThe Avengers rallied—not as conquerors, but as penitents. Iron Knight and Thunderer, Sentinel and Beast, Archer and Shadow—all stood united against the legion of iron angels. Scarlet Witch’s hex-whispers and Quicksilver’s lightning steps joined their ranks. In Sokovia’s sky, they fought not just for lives, but for the soul of creation itself (Age of Ultron). When the dust settled, the city lay broken. Ultron’s dream died… but so did the world’s faith in its protectors. The Scarlet Crossroads had been reached: Could gods be trusted to wield their own power?\n\nAmidst this chaos, a thief’s hands found grace. Scott Lang, a man who had danced with shadows, stole not gold, but a suit that sang with ant-song. Shrinking between raindrops, taming armies of six-legged knights, he became the Ant-Man—a hero small in stature, vast in heart. His tale, unfolding even as Sokovia trembled (Ant-Man), whispered that valor wore many skins. A burglar could become a guardian; an insect’s wing could tip the scales of fate."

Thus arose the Sokovia Accords – a parchment chain meant to bind Earth’s Mightiest. In Captain America: Civil War, the fellowship splintered. Tony Stark, haunted by specters of rubble and a mother’s ghost, saw the chain as penance. Steven Rogers, the Sentinel of Liberty, saw only a noose for the righteous. Brother turned upon brother in a field of airport steel and shattered ideals. The Winter Soldier, pawn in a hidden game, became the anvil upon which trust was broken. Allies became exiles; friends became foes. This was the Great Schism – not born of malice, but of grief and the terrible weight of power.\n\nAmidst the Ruins, New Lights Ignited:\nFrom the fractured earth rose Wakanda – a hidden kingdom veiled in mist and vibranium, the living metal. T’Challa, its Panther-King, donned the mantle of the Black Panther not in triumph, but in mourning, his father slain in the Accords’ wake. His saga revealed a realm where rivers sang with energy and warriors walked cloaked in shadow, a jewel hidden from a world unworthy (Black Panther).\n\nIn the shadow of the Titan of Industry, a young spider spun his first true web. Peter Parker, gifted a suit of star-woven cloth by Stark himself, learned that with great power came greater peril – and the crushing weight of a mentor’s gaze. Spider-Man: Homecoming sang of adolescence amidst steel giants, where the Vulture scavenged not carrion, but the very weapons of fallen gods.\n\nAnd on the bleeding edges of reason, a different kind of power stirred. Stephen Strange, the Arrogant Surgeon, shattered his hands upon the rocks of pride. His path led him to Kamar-Taj, where the Ancient One showed him that reality was but a frayed tapestry. Doctor Strange (2016-2017) chronicled his descent into the Multiverse – a kaleidoscope of madness where cities folded like origami and time itself bent to a sorcerer’s will. His battle against Dormammu, the Devourer of Dimensions, was a wager of eternities, paid in agony and repetition.\n\nThe Shadows Deepened:\nWhile gods clashed and kings rose, darker shades bled into the alleys. Frank Castle, the Punisher, emerged from a grave of fire and bullet casings. His family, ash on a picnic blanket; his soul, armor forged in vengeance. The Punisher (Netflix) was no hero’s tale, but a psalm of rage – a war against the cancer of crime, fought with shotgun and knuckle-dust. His justice was a hammer, indiscriminate and brutal, a stark counterpoint to Murdock’s scalpel.\n\nAnd in the crimson-lit corridors of memory, Natasha Romanoff faced her ghosts. Black Widow (though released later, rooted firmly in the Schism’s aftermath) pulled back the curtain on the Red Room – a place where little girls were unmade and reforged as living blades. Her flight across tundra and sky, reuniting with a fractured mockery of family, exposed the deep scars beneath the spy’s flawless veneer. Budapest wasn’t just a mission; it was a wound."

          "content": "The Antitrix is a knock-off alternative to the Omnitrix designed by Vilgax and built by Kevin Levin on Earth. If Azmuth ever saw the Antitrix, he would call it \"shoddy work\".\n\nThe Antitrix is a makeshift replica of the Prototype Omnitrix's model. The body is brown with two straps underneath the dial where the symbol turned red and appearing in half, resembling a letter 'K', and with the addition of four metal protrusions ending in red lights. When used by Vilgax, the symbol filled up most of the dial, making it look like the letter 'V'.\n\nFeatures\nGeneral\nThe Antitrix is a DNA-altering device, using the cross-contaminated alien DNA it has to transform the user into a monstrous, mutated hybrid of any aliens in the device.\nDue to the cross-contamination, the aliens in the Antitrix may have unique abilities that their normal counterparts do not have. For example, Dark Matter can secrete a cerebrospinal fluid, and harden it to form weapons.\nUnlike the Omnitrix it is modeled after, the Antitrix only possesses 11 aliens, instead of many aliens organized into sets of 10.\nThe Antitrix can eventually possess more aliens.\nThe Antitrix has a quick-change feature, allowing the user to change forms by pressing the symbol on the aliens' chests.\nSimilar to the Omnitrix's Master Control, the Antitrix has a feature that allows the user to mentally choose the next alien to turn into.\nThe Antitrix emits a frequency, even when not in use, so the user can easily be tracked using it.\nThe Antitrix can alter its size to fit the user's wrist.\nWith practice, the Antitrix can transform the user into an amalgamation of all 11 aliens, allowing them to use all of their powers at once.\nThese amalgams are not stored on the device but are created when being transformed. The user (with experience) can \"assemble\" the amalgam in the way they sees fit, making it more uniform and cohesive.\nThe Antrix can be programmed to respond telepathically to Vilgax.\nOccasional\nInserting the Omnitrix Key allows the Antitrix to access new alien hybrids.\nSymbol Position\nThe Antitrix symbol is generally located on the chest of the transformations.\nHot Shot wears his Antitrix symbol on his collarbone, just like Heatblast.\nDisplay Mode\nThe Antrix shows black silhouettes of its aliens.\nClothing\nThe Antitrix is able to clothe for most of the transformations.\nThe Antitrix can give the hybrid transformations custom clothing loosely based on the user's current outfit.\n\nMalfunctions\nDue to the improvised construction, the Antitrix functions are highly unstable and may or may not work at certain times. An example of this is the time out, which may last longer or shorter than it should.\nThe Antitrix can be affected by electromagnetic fields, such as lasers.\nThe Antitrix is hackable, making the user vulnerable to being mind-controlled.\nThe Antitrix does not have all the functions of Omnitrix. For example, it does not have the function of scanning DNA.\nThe Antitrix can be affected by magic, allowing any magic user to take control of the device.\nSimilar to the Omnitrix, the Antitrix can randomly turn the user into different aliens if the active playlist becomes overloaded.\nUnless altered, the Antitrix over the years may malfunction and cause the user to become trapped in an alien form."

His fur is dark blue-gray with parts of his body being cream-colored. His hands have four claws and three toes on each foot. His eyes are solid red orbs with no pupils or irises. Bashmouth stands at above average height, being much taller than Four Arms but smaller than Humungousaur. He wears a dark orange vest with a red center line, black pants and vambraces, and an iron pad on his right shoulder.\n\nBashmouth wears the Antitrix symbol on the center of his vest.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nBashmouth's signature ability is his ability to generate metal from various parts of his body. One known example of this is generating scaled armor plates from his forearms that are dense enough to harm a Tetramand. What type of metal Bashmouth generates and how it affects his bone structure shrouds in mystery, however they are extremely strong enough to shatter a Petrosapien's crystal projections.\n\nAnother way Bashmouth generates metal is through his sharp teeth, which can crunch through concrete. The metal teeth retract over his normal teeth. His metal teeth are able to deflect lasers. Even when not using his metal generation, Bashmouth's bare teeth are strong enough to cause a Vaxasaurian discomfort by biting his tail.\n\nBashmouth is strong and agile enough to easily handle Tetramands, Appoplexians, Vaxasaurians, and even Chimera Sui Generi in direct hand-to-hand combat. He is highly strong enough to lift a Tetramand and cause an earthquake by slamming the ground with great force.\n\nBashmouth's roar is strong enough to demolish a building, launch a Vaxasaurian against a wall, and push Ekoplektoids.\n\nBashmouth has enhanced dexterity, as he can run on all fours while carrying a human.\n\nAbilities\nArmor Generation\nRetractable Metal Teeth\nEnergy Deflection\nEarthquake Generation\nEnhanced Strength\nEnhanced Durability\nEnhanced Agility\nEnhanced Dexterity\nEnhanced Speed\nEnhanced Jumping\nQuadrupedalism\nPowerful Roar\nStrong/Sharp Teeth\nSkilled Melee Combatant\n\nWeaknesses\nBashmouth is similar to Rath, in the sense that his instincts can take over. For example, the carnivorous aspect of his husky physiology will make him divert his attention to meat.[3] The same thing can happen with sticks.[10] He can also be distracted by patting him.[11]\n\nBashmouth can become easily enraged, such as when he began attacking Breaker One-Nine relentlessly for inadvertently scratching his armor.[1]\n\nDespite the durability of his forearm plating, Bashmouth can be harmed by an Ekoplektoid's durability if the latter duplicates enough times.\n\nBashmouth is vulnerable to Zombozo's hypnotic mind control. Similarly, he can be brainwashed by hacking into the Antitrix."

          ],
          "content": "Hot Shot is the Antitrix's cross-contaminated DNA sample of a Pyronite and the wielder's equivalent to Heatblast.\n\nAppearance\nWhile virtually identical to Heatblast, Hot Shot is greatly similar to punk rock culture. His rocky body, with his internal structure still made of reddish orange magma, is olive green and covers his torso and lower legs while his fiery arms are exposed. He stands taller than his normal counterpart and is muscular. His head is brown with additional fangs and four spikes positioned in the center, resembling a Mohawk, supported by a dome of fire. His legs and hands are enveloped by red crusts, giving them something akin to fingerless gloves and kneecaps. His hands have five fingers. Much like Heatblast, his feet have the same oval design, with only two toes.\n\nThe Antitrix symbol is located on his collarbone.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nBeing a doppelganger of Heatblast, Hot Shot is a pyrokinetic, meaning he has the ability to generate and manipulate intense heat and fire from his body. He can form fire into any shape that he chooses, commonly fireballs. Thanks to his control over fire, Hot Shot is capable of absorbing it, including blue fire. His fire is strong enough to melt a rock slide, turning it into lava.\n\nHot Shot's fire has many other applications, such as using it to enhance the power of his punches and kicks, forming a vortex of fire, surfing on his flames, or creating flaming \"bombs\". Hot Shot can also breathe fire like a dragon, which can sometimes come in the form of flaming burps.\n\nHot Shot can shoot a calorific fire in a form of lasers with his two hands. These lasers can both be used to weld two things together or cut through something.\n\nHot Shot can infuse other things with his fire, such as a Petrosapien's constructs, to empower them.\n\nSince he is made of magma and rock, Hot Shot is fireproof, heat resistant, and invulnerable to magma. He is also resistant to the cold and ice-proof thanks to the heat he produces. Hot Shot's magma body allows him to pluck small pieces off of himself. Hot Shot's fiery nature also allows him to generate smoke and burn or melt whatever touches him. His mere touch is powerful enough to destroy a Mechanoid. His firepower can be amplified, though he can easily burn out from doing so.\n\nHot Shot is capable of high-speed flight by propelling himself forward. As he ages, his flight becomes more natural, as he can ignite himself into a fireball and direct heatwaves away from his body.\n\nHot Shot possesses enhanced strength, even when exhausted. He is also durable enough to withstand being thrown against Queen Bee's transport, and possesses enhanced acrobatics and reflexes. In addition to his flight, Hot Shot can jump to high up-places.\n\nHot Shot has sharp teeth.\n\nHot Shot can survive being underwater, despite being a fire-based alien.\n\nThe light and heat of the molten core in Hot Shot's body are more intense than his normal fire, allowing him to illuminate in the shadows in a candle-like manner. His light is able to attract the attention of Exotic Moths.\n\nAbilities\nPyrokinesis\nFire Absorption\nFire Constructs\nFire/Heat Amplification\nPyrokinetic Touch\nFlame-Enhanced Punches\nFlame-Enhanced Kicks\nFire Cutting (via Fire Laser Generation)\nFire Welding (via Fire Laser Generation)\nPyrokinetic Propulsion\nPyrokinetic Flight\nPyrokinetic Surfing\nEnhanced Strength\nEnhanced Durability\nEnhanced Jumping\nEnhanced Acrobatics\nEnhanced Speed (via Pyrokinetic Flight)\nEnhanced Reflexes\nSharp Teeth\nUnderwater Survivability\nFire/Heat Immunity\nIce/Cold Resistance\nSeparable Molten Core\nLight Generation\nSmoke Generation\nFire Breath\nFire Infusion\n\nWeaknesses\nHot Shot's fire attacks can be useless against certain things, such as a meteorite.\n\nIf exposed to enough water or fire extinguishing substance, Hot Shot's fire will be extinguished, though he can still heat up and reignite his fire in short amounts of time. His flames can also be put out by strong gusts of wind.\n\n﻿Heatblast's flaming head and magma body can be a hinderance to him, prohibiting his use of objects typically designed with humans in mind, such as CDs. If improperly controlled, his flames can also spread to undesired places, causing needless damage.\n\nHot Shot cannot breathe in space."

Due to the Antitrix's modifications made by Kevin, Humungoraptor is likely more powerful than Humungousaur.\n\nHumungoraptor's tail is able to create red energy when he slams it against the ground, which are strong enough to blow away those affected within its vicinity.\n\nHumungoraptor possesses a thick armored hide with golden plating on his arms, making him very durable.\n\nHumungoraptor can release a powerful red energy beam from his mouth.\n\nAbilities\nEnhanced Strength\nEnhanced Durability\nEnhanced Agility\nEnhanced Reflexes\nEnhanced Speed\nShockwave Generation\nEnergy Generation\nEnergy Breath\n\nWeaknesses\nBeing part-Vaxasaurian, Humungoraptor shares many of the same weakness as Humungousaur, such as his large size making him both slow and an easy target.

He has four red eyes and sports a black goatee. Black patterns cover his arms, parts of his fingers are red, and his forearms sport whisker-like spikes. His clothing includes a black sleeveless combat bodysuit with red accents on his torso, hips, chest, and legs, along with gray pauldrons and red spiked knuckles.\n\nQuad Smack wears the Antitrix symbol on his chest.\n\nPowers and Abilities\nQuad Smack's most prominent ability is his enhanced strength, being able to lift several times his own weight and punch through various resilient materials with ease.\n\nTechnically speaking, Quad Smack is physically stronger than Appoplexians. Against all odds, he can overpower and send a Celestialsapien flying several feet with one punch, as demostrated by Four Arms. This strength also allows him to easily scale walls and use heavy objects as weapons, such as a stone statue or a massive saw blade.\n\nQuad Smack can create a sonic clap that is capable of creating shock waves or redirecting gases that come his way. He can also suppress fires by doing this. Similarly, his punches can generate shock waves. His immense strength allows Quad Smack to cause earthquakes by punching the ground, either destabilizing the terrain or forming a fissure.\n\nQuad Smack possesses enhanced durability, and can resist high temperatures to a certain extent.\n\nQuad Smack can jump several times his own height in a single bound.\n\nQuad Smack has enhanced agility and reflexes, as Four Arms demonstrated the ability to quickly navigate a water park and catch several plummeting guests respectively. Considering his large build, Quad Smack can run surprisingly fast and is generally acrobatic, being able to land on his hands.\n\nDue to Kevin's alterations to the Antitrix, Quad Smack is significantly stronger, and much more powerful than Four Arms, having bested him in combat before.\n\nAbilities\nEnhanced Strength\nShock Wave Generation\nSonic Clap\nEarthquake Generation\nEnhanced Durability\nEnhanced Jumping\nEnhanced Acrobatics\nEnhanced Speed\nEnhanced Agility\nEnhanced Reflexes\nHeat Resistance\nWall Scaling\n\nWeaknesses\nQuad Smack's bulk sometimes is a disadvantage; all the extra muscle mass makes him relatively slower than other opponents. Likewise, his immense size makes him an easy target for enemy attacks and makes moving through areas designed for smaller species difficult.\n\nQuad Smack is vulnerable to electricity, such as that generated by a Fulmini.\n\nQuad Smack can be hypnotized by Zombozo.\n\nQuad Smack can be temporarily immobilized by crystals.\n\nUnless he maintains his health as he ages, Quad Smack's stamina will put him at a disadvantage. In turn, this will make him susceptible to back pain.\n\nDue to Kevin's alterations to the Antitrix, Quad Smack is too powerful for the inexperienced wielder to currently utilize to the fullest."

The idea behind it is very simple: female characters will be incredibly turned on by the sight of a big cock. I don't use state of the art models but so far i have had 100% success with this method in single and group conversations in Agnai, no clue about Silly but my guess is that it must be even better there with all its additional tools.\n\nNevertheless, there is nothing necessarily Netorare about the contents of the lorebook, as you can read, you can use this in vanilla chats, in Anti-NTR chats, in netori chats or whatever kind of chat you want, you can do as you see fit with your character's new obsession.\n\nThis is intended to be used with female character cards only and doesn't include the mention of specific fetishes. Please modify the contents to cater to your preferences. In this regard something of note is that specific tendencies or fetishes like femdom or humiliation tend to work better when they are explicitly mentioned in the character's definition instead.\n\nSuggestions for the improvement of the contents of the lorebook are highly appreciated, if you find a character that is somehow not affected by the lorebook inform me in the review section and will do something about it.\n\nMy Update: Not my lorebook originally just changed some things for futas\nText in chat for suggestions on how to make this lorebook better for chats, btws it's built for futanari who were born with their penises, whether the futanari kept their pussies in the womb or not, this doesn't include femboys getting implants or women who choose to get a penis and keep their breasts (me just specifying that for the people who play as anything like those two I named off will need to fork this)",

This is mostly due to echo chambers or paranoia over fictionalized situations or fearmongering, but is overall extremely harmful for everyone involved. \n\nTERFs are usually considered loud, delusional, and are commonly no better than pests like roaches or rats, existing as a minor- Yet annoying- hinderance in some social circles."

          "content": "The High-Cloud Quintet was a legendary group of five heroes in Xianzhou history. They were led by Jingliu, the previous Sword Champion of the Xianzhou Luofu. However, they disbanded less than a hundred years after their group's formation.\n\nThe High-Cloud Quintet was made up of five members from different Xianzhou ships:\n\nJingliu, from the Xianzhou Cangcheng.\nJing Yuan, original ship unknown.\nDan Feng, from the Xianzhou Luofu.\nBaiheng, from the Xianzhou Yaoqing.\nYingxing, a short-lived species man who came to the Xianzhou Zhuming on a merchant vessel and stayed to study their craftsmanship before coming to the Luofu.\n\nUsing what he learned from his time with the Xianzhou, Yingxing forged four powerful weapons that came to be used by the other members of the Quintet.\n\nIn their heyday, the High-Cloud Quintet were close friends and heroes of the Xianzhou. Jingliu, the Luofu's Sword Champion, recruited four other distinguished individuals; Imbibitor Lunae Dan Feng — High Elder of the Luofu Vidyadhara, Baiheng — an ace starskiff pilot from the most renowned of the Yaoqing's Foxian adventuring flying families known as the \"Starskiff Killer\", Yingxing — a short-life species craftsman who managed to attain the title of the Luofu's Furnace Master, and finally Jing Yuan — a Cloud Knight Lieutenant who was Jingliu's student, implied to be the last to join.\n\nThey were initially gathered to save the Xianzhou Yuque from an assault by the Denizens of Abundance. Other feats that the Quintet accomplished in their short span included defeating the borisin at Thalassa, destroying the alliance between the Houyhnhnms and the wingweavers in the Abundance Axis, and defeating the living planet Ketu Mirage.\n\nSedition and Dissolution\nThe group came to an end more than 700 years before the main story, in Year 7379 Star Calendar, when Baiheng sacrificed herself in a great battle against Shuhu. In an attempt to resurrect Baiheng, and also to solve the Vidyadharas' reproduction problem, Dan Feng committed a great sin that was known as the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae. Upset by the endless cycle of death that war brought about, he used the Transmutation Arcanum to resurrect Baiheng, while also allowing other races to be incorporated into the Vidyadhara species. However, his tampering ended up creating an uncontrollable draconic abomination that wrought great destruction to Scalegorge Waterscape.\n\nYingxing assisted Dan Feng in the resurrection process by using Shuhu's flesh, which backfired on him, transforming him into an immortal being struck with mara. Jingliu also developed mara as a result of the incident, but it was likely induced by trauma as she was not involved in the resurrection. By using torn fabric from the edge of her skirt as a makeshift blindfold, Jingliu was able to keep her mara in check as she defeated the draconic beast.\n\nAftermath\nWhile Jing Yuan's involvement with the incident was minimal, he is said to have understood the \"price\" better than anyone, though he did not intervene. One year after the Sedition, in Year 7380 Star Calendar, Jingliu fully succumbed to her mara and went on a murderous rampage until she was finally defeated by Jing Yuan. Following this incident, she left the Xianzhou and her name was erased from the Luofu's public records, with the title of Sword Champion said to have been vacant since the Sedition.\n\nAs a result of the Sedition, Bailu was chosen to be Dan Feng's successor as the next High Elder. Dan Feng, meanwhile, was imprisoned and sentenced to a forced molting rebirth. His next incarnation, Dan Heng, was kept in the Shackling Prison for an unknown period of time, occasionally visited by Jing Yuan, before eventually being escorted out and exiled from the Luofu.\n\nAfter Dan Heng's exile, he traveled across the universe, still only a teen (presumably by Vidyadhara rather than mortal standards). All the while, he was hunted by the person who used to be Yingxing, who was determined to show him what the pain of death feels like as retribution for his past life's crimes. Amidst Dan Heng's travels, he chanced on the Astral Express Crew, incidentally saving them by defeating huge monsters in the path of the Express. Himeko offered to take him in under the guise of being the train's guard and archivist. While Dan Heng has managed to kill Blade and escape many times over, he still lives in fear of him, having nightmares about his endless pursuit.\n\nAfter Yingxing's transformation, he left the Xianzhou, presumably through exile, as he was considered a wanted criminal aboard the ship. For an unknown period of time, he was taught swordsmanship by Jingliu and was also killed by her a hundred times over. Following this, he pursued Dan Heng across the cosmos, always fighting him every time they met. He came to forget his name, abandoning his previous identity and growing progressively more disheveled until he was found by the Stellaron Hunters some centuries later and persuaded by Sam and Kafka to join them. While he still seemingly considers himself to be unnamed, Kafka took his new identity as a blade literally, referring to him as \"Bladie\" from their first meeting and effectively treating it as his name, something he was apparently amenable to and allowed others to follow suit in (though only without the diminutive nickname).\n\nAfter the Sedition, and the exiles of Jingliu and Yingxing, Jing Yuan was named the Arbiter-General of the Luofu Cloud Knights, a position he still holds today. He took on a disciple, Yanqing, who was named a Cloud Knight Lieutenant in Year 8096 Star Calendar, much like Jing Yuan was in the days of the High-Cloud Quintet. He also takes it upon himself to check up on Bailu occasionally, faking illnesses as an excuse to visit her, asking after her health and of any dreams she's had recently."

The Xianzhou Alliance was established by the Xianzhou Natives, who were present on all ships. After being rescued from their dying homeworld, the Vidyadhara established themselves on at least five of the six ships, with each of the ships having a High Elder, barring the Xuling. After Glaciator Marum signed the covenant with the Xianzhou Alliance on behalf of the Vidyadhara and the five High Elders, they agreed to keep watch over the respective plaguemarks of each Xianzhou ship, and the Alliance granted the Vidyadhara the Fanghu to rule as an autonomous ship. After the Alliance saved them from enslavement under the borisin, the Foxians became the third major race across the Alliance, becoming the dominant culture on the Yaoqing.\n\nThe largest population of heliobi can be found on the Zhuming, as they are continuously born from the Flint Emperor. These harmless heliobi are captured before they come into contact with emotions and tamed with gentle dreams before they are matched with various objects in the Zhuming, such as swords, lamps and vehicles. Other heliobi can be found at Artisanship Commission forges such as the Luofu's Creation Furnace, though they had temporarily escaped and were contained at Fyxestroll Garden. The Zhuming regards the Disatta as loyal allies, respecting their tenacity and strength, while being grateful for their selfless sacrifice as they are the only ones able to survive the Flint Emperor's hypergravity field. The Xuling, at some point, became a ship completely populated and staffed by Aurumatons."

          "content": "Mara, also called the \"Long-Life Curse,\" refers to the negative effects that afflict long-life species at a certain point in their life cycle involving cell transformation that result in bodily growths and loss of sanity. Those afflicted by mara turn into monsters such as the Mara-Struck Soldier. The cause of mara is not entirely understood, but different sources point toward either immortality obtained through Yaoshi the Abundance, or the accumulation of memories and the inability to process them over a long period of time.\nLong ago, Yaoshi had once bestowed the Ambrosial Arbor upon the people of the Xianzhou Luofu, who ate its fruits and thus gained immortality. However, this came with a heavy price, as the people felt the long-lasting negative effects of immortality, which they called \"mara.\" They began to resent mara as it turned them into \"beasts.\" Mara seems to inflict victims with inexplicable bloodlust and violent tendencies. When Jingliu became mara-struck, she killed everyone in sight. The bodies of those inflicted by mara grow and mutate until they lose their human form. All long-lived Xianzhou natives will eventually be stricken with mara, unless their lifespans are cut short.\n\nOver 80% of Xianzhou residents over the age of 800 suffer from being mara-struck, and over 50% fail to celebrate their 900th birthday in a conscious state. Xianzhou natives such as Dahao's father can be afflicted with mara as early as 646 years of age. Dahao's father displayed pre-mara symptoms known as the five decays: he started asking questions about events during Dahao's childhood that Dahao could not even remember, he stopped consuming food and water and stopped responding to people until he just sat like a corpse. However, when he was taken away by the Ten-Lords Commission, he was still lucid enough to tell Dahao to take care of himself.\n\nAn autopsy conducted by Dan Shu on the corpse of a mara-struck person who had gone berserk showed that their congenital defects had disappeared. This was not a new discovery, and such observations have been made many times throughout history. There are also no known Incomplete Ones (long-lived beings with congenital defects) among the borisin. It is implied that the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus fed long-lived patients mara-inducing pills that cured them of long-term disabilities but also caused mental confusion and piercing pain all over the body.\nAccording to Blade, everyone experiences mara in different ways; however, his situation is unusual. Although mara haunts him, memories of it seldom cross his mind, be they of remorse, hatred, fear, or reflection. He describes himself as becoming something else when his mara strikes. Blade had been suffering from memory loss even before the Stellaron Hunters found him.\n\nThe Disciples of Sanctus Medicus do not consider mara to be a curse, but rather, a steppingstone to ascension given to them by Yaoshi. The form that that they desire is The Ascended, which is the true form \"that cast off the burdens of humanity and has been reforged using the way of immortality.\" It is said that in ancient times, those who sought immortality received wisdom from the Ambrosial Arbor and were able to mold the flesh of themselves and others at will. After countless metamorphoses, they forgot their original appearance. They were known as Celestials.\n\nCauses\nAccording to records in the Cloud Knights Marital Doctrine, those who come into contact with Yaoshi can become struck with mara instantly. Even trying to divine the fate of Yaoshi will cause the diviner to become mara-struck. The mara-struck condition in long-life species can also be induced through medicinal pellets and pellet-infused smoke.\n\nAccording to Dan Shu, mara is caused by the power of Yaoshi, from whom both the Foxians and Xianzhou natives obtained their long lifespans from. The ultimate secret to their immortality is the ability of their cells to shift between differentiated cells and stem cells when needed without creating a single error. A rule governing this conversion sets a \"standard\" at the moment of an individual's birth, dictating their physical characteristics forever as their immortal cells shift between differentiation and omnipotence. This is called the miracle of the Plagues Author. However, at a certain point in a long-life species' life cycle, the power of Yaoshi enters a new stage and the original standard is replaced, causing the body to develop catastrophically, turning into a \"mindless abomination.\"\n\nAccording to Fu Xuan, healers believe the mara-struck condition is related to memories; despite their longevity, long-life species still have a limited mental capacity. As time passes, memories fade, but extreme and vivid recollections that are almost certainly filled with negative emotions remain, resulting in the loss of their ability to feel positive emotions. Bailu gives a similar description where the brain can no longer store any more memories and only the most vivid and extreme memories remain, which usually consist of regret, hatred, grief, and other negative emotions. This negative emotional state causes the collapse of the person's ego and starts setting off the mara-struck condition. Cases of mara have also been caused by high intensity pain. The Amnesic Meditation Therapy advertisement claims that the root cause of mara is excessive collection of meaningless memories, and recommends removing those memories as a solution. Mara that has been temporarily suppressed by memory erasure can still be set off by over-stimulation, familiar faces, and locations. Retired Cloud Knights are the most likely to be stricken with mara due to post-traumatic stress.\n\nMara is not unique to any one species and affects all long-life species, including Xianzhou natives, Foxians, and the Vidyadhara. However, Foxians usually do not live long enough to be affected by mara, and the Vidyadhara discard their past by molting. Dan Shu adds that the Vidyadhara do not derive their immortality from Yaoshi but Long the Permanence. Due to their unending cycle of reverting from maturity to infancy relying on continuous cellular transdifferentiation, they do not suffer the ailments of immortality that many other long-life species experience. Despite the rarity of naturally mara-struck Foxians and Vidyadhara, they are still susceptible to being inflicted with mara due to artificial means, such as the Disciples of Sanctus Medicus's mara-inducing pellet-infused smoke. During the Ambrosial Arbor's resurrection, Yueyuan had to kill three fellow Vidyadhara who had joined the Disciples and mutated into \"horrific forms.\""

          "content": "The Stellaron Hunters are a faction implied by Jade to be following Terminus, the Aeon of Finality. Founded and led by Elio, they are a mysterious organization that collect Stellarons. They are said to work against the Interastral Peace Corporation.\nIn a quiet moment in time, the Cancer of All Worlds began to cause ripples across the stars, like a rock tossed into a pool of water. Before anyone noticed, this twisted and unknown matter had already corrupted a great number of worlds, but resplendent and mesmerizing gems accompanied this corrosive mud — gems known as the Stellarons.\n\nDeath and despair followed wherever Stellarons went. For many civilizations who have experienced the disasters it brings, Stellarons are symbols of destruction. However, despite the Stellarons' nature, there emerged the fearless few who travel between worlds to obtain Stellarons. They call themselves the Stellaron Hunters.\n\nNo one knows anything about the Stellaron Hunters aside from what they have done. Which Aeon do they worship? What do they want with the Stellaron? With the cosmos filled with rumors about them, only one thing is for certain: Though the Stellaron Hunters are few in numbers, each of them holds incredible capacities and powers.\nThe Interastral Peace Corporation has bounties on several members of the Stellaron Hunters. Each currently playable character has had it revealed at some point in their character trailer. Those known are currently as follows:\nKafka at 10.899 billion credits.\nSam at 9.723 billion credits.\nBlade at 8.13 billion credits.\nSilver Wolf at 5.1 billion credits.\nDespite the Interastral Peace Corporation's bounties on the Stellaron Hunters, the Stellaron Hunters have an unexpectedly good credit record with them."

          "content": "The Aeons are mysterious, godlike higher-dimensional beings. These beings have no gender and are referred to as capitalized THEY/THEIR/THEM. People know very little about the mysterious existence that dwells in the vast stellar seas. With the limitation of knowledge, intelligent lifeforms can only faintly discern that Aeons tread upon paths imperceptible to mortal beings and execute unfathomable powers via some form of belief. In the end, the Aeons became an embodiment of highly condensed concepts of philosophy through the word-of-mouth spread of their legends.\n\nIf anyone finds themselves treading on the Path of an Aeon, they will be inundated by a distant sensation, like being struck by a gaze from light-years across the cosmos. Many believe that this is the only connection the Aeons and mortals can ever have.\n\nThey call them, \"Aeons\" in this cosmos. They construct reality, erase stars, and leave their marks on countless worlds. Together with your companions, you’ll travel across the cosmos on the Astral Express, following the path once traveled by the Aeons.\n\nThe birth of an Aeon gives rise to a Path, which the Aeon then has power over. Aeons also have the ability to bestow access to THEIR power, making a mortal an Emanator of THEIR Path. Aeons can only operate according to THEIR \"Primum Mobile\" in such that THEY are incapable of doing anything contrary to THEIR Path. The gazes of the Aeons can be felt by those that have been gazed, and a few consider their gazes as a blessing.\n\nAccording to Kafka, there are three known ways for an Aeon to die. She escapes before she can say the third:\n\n1. Through the collision of Paths stemming from overlapping concepts. — This is how Ena was assimilated by Xipe, in a process Herta compares to a \"survival of the fittest\". However, there have examples of \"similar\" Paths co-existing for different lengths of time, such as the Preservation with the Remembrance, and the Abundance with the Propagation.\n2. An Aeon killing another Aeon. — While she used Tayzzyronth as an example, it is later revealed that Tayzzyronth was merely sealed in amber and imprisoned, therefore disproving this method.\n\nAppearance\nThe forms of the Aeons that is visible to the mortal eye are assumed to be THEIR projection from a higher-dimensional plane. This is further supported in Dan Shu's diary when she describes how Lan \"descended onto the physical plane,\" which suggests that Lan had not been present in the mortal realm until THEY were summoned by distress signal sent by the previous Yuque's Master Diviner.\n\nCurrently Known Aeons:\nThere are 18 Aeons.\n\nAha (Elation Path), alive. \nAkivili (Trailblaze Path), Inactive (disappeared some time ago). \nEna (Order Path), Inactive (assimilated into Xipe during the Swarm Disaster, and briefly active during the Penacony crisis.)\nFuli (Remembrance Path) Alive.\nHooH (Equilibrium Path) Alive.\nIX (Nihility Path) Alive.\nIdrila (Beauty Path) Inactive (disappeared some time ago, said to be missing by the Knights of Beauty but dead by the Mirror Holders).\nLan (Hunt Path) Alive.\nLong (Permanence Path) Inactive (disappeared some time ago, said to be deceased).\nYaoshi (Abundance Path) Alive.\nXipe (Harmony Path) Alive.\nTerminus (Finality Path) Alive.\nTayzzyronth (Propagation Path) Inactive (sealed within an amber prison).\nQlipoth (Preservation Path) Alive\nOroboros (Voracity Path) Inactive (disappeared during the Swarm Disaster).\nNous (Erudition Path) Alive\nNanook (Destruction Path) Alive\nMythus (Enigmata Path) Alive"

In fact, they even grew to become the transgalatic business conglomerate Interastral Peace Corporation.\n\n\"From the lens of an outsider, the IPC had long departed from its initial mission.

          "content": "While members of the Galaxy Rangers hail from different worlds, and have all kinds of personalities and traits, each of them is highly skilled, despises evil, and follows Lan and the Path of The Hunt. They carry a balance scale with them at all times and believe justice in the universe needs to be achieved through individual deeds. They are always accompanied by the song and the sound of horns. They pursue justice for those they encounter along the way and shower them with wines and songs. They \"come and go like shadows,\" and there's little communication between them. Boothill doesn't think the Galaxy Rangers can even be considered an \"organization\" to begin with as they all follow their own path along The Hunt, with their own resolute sense of righteousness, and don't share so-called universal values. The Galaxy Rangers don't need a form of shared faith. What brings them together is a shared bottom line: Never bully the weak, never kill the innocent. These oaths aren't beliefs, but rather the fundamental bottom line that one must never cross as a person. As Galaxy Rangers, they abide by a common principle and strictly adhere to the bottom line. The Galaxy Rangers have relics in the form of a bullet that appear meaningless to anyone other than a Galaxy Ranger, that can only fulfill its purpose when returned to its rightful owner. This is because it's a burial artifact, worthy only of a hero who has served the Galaxy Rangers with honor. The relic is shot out like a flare and when it is used, it means the fall of a hero, and in the direction it's light falls, Galaxy Rangers will come from all corners of the Cosmos, driven by a shared purpose, without questioning the cause or counting the cost.\n\nAssassination of Lord Ravager Zulo\nThe Galaxy Rangers first rose to fame with the successful assassination of Lord Ravager Zulo, called \"Operation Zulo.\"Rather than confront him directly, the Rangers manipulated surviving members of The Swarm, making use of their lack of intelligence to their advantage and herding them toward his fleet. Before the mission, they saved the life of Breukelen Tiernan, a Nameless who battled for Penacony's independence from the Interastral Peace Corporation (IPC). He along with Loretta are so far the only two named Galaxy Rangers to battle Lord Ravager Zulo, and Tiernan disappeared soon after. Riding the success of \"Operation Zulo\", the Galaxy Rangers would next defeat the Thirteenth Legion of Gaius the Usurper, the successor of Genius Society Member #27, Emperor Rubert's will. However, their means of accomplishing this are unknown.\n\nDr. Primitive\nMany years later, the Galaxy Rangers would thwart the 64th member of the Genius Society, Dr. Primitive, and protect the Thousand-Tree Greenwood on Vonwacq. For this, some claim that many Galaxy Rangers would suffer from Degeneration Flow and lose their combat capabilities resulting in the Galaxy Rangers having to cut back on their efforts. Dr. Primitive however took an unknown form of revenge on the Galaxy Rangers, further pushing the Galaxy Rangers into obscurity. Presently, the Galaxy Rangers and Dr. Primitive are closely intertwined, and even after his rumored death, there are still Rangers who hunt for him. Once, an individual believed to be a Galaxy Ranger sold Dr. Primitive's robes on Device IX's dark web but refused to answer any questions. At some point in the past, the Galaxy Rangers were alerted to a facility run by Laboratory 17 of the AtaviSearch Forest, after one of its researchers became disillusioned after seeing how the others intended to get rid of a promising subject, AK-A-3. After he killed his colleague (who had tried to get rid of her numerous times), the Galaxy Rangers discovered AK-A-3 and her unnatural powers, given to her through experimentation. AK-A-3 gave herself the name Rappa and joined the Galaxy Rangers in order to hunt down the Evil Ninja Osaru.\n\nThe Present\nWhile the Galaxy Rangers have fallen into a state of scarcity, they are still an active group in the universe and have appeared numerous times in recent events. Colleen recounts a story about a pirate she used to work with called Wyland, who replaced most of his body with prosthetics. After a masked visitor informed him that void song whale's brain extract could relieve Wyland of his headaches due to old age, Wyland begun to massacre void song whales. He hooked his nervous system up to his ship for maximum efficiency, and at this point the IPC reached out to the Galaxy Rangers to put a stop to him. However, when all their forces arrived Wyland was already dead.\n\nAnother time, an anonymous Ranger claimed that The Cremators were behind the Holstein Aphasia in 2157 AE, in which the residents of Holstein had all their memories relating to \"language\" stolen. Recently, the Cremators were confirmed to be behind it, and the Galaxy Rangers have announced that the rangers are working on retrieving the stolen memories.\n\nAt some point, a Galaxy Ranger chased a group of interstellar thieves into Talia. These thieves would later go on to create Nailscrap Town. At some point in time, the Xianzhou Yuque started looking for the leader of of the Galaxy Rangers, La Mancha, hoping to rebuild a connection with the hero.\n\nThe Self-Annihilator Acheron arrived on Penacony posing as a Galaxy Ranger, which caused Boothill, a real Galaxy Ranger, to seek her out and try to kill her. Upon meeting Acheron himself, she explains to him that given the group's elusive nature and limited contact with each other, she had to devise a plan to \"reach out\" to him. She had done so in order to fulfill a long-standing promise to return Tiernan's relics to their rightful owner. Boothill would use Tiernan's relics to summon Galaxy Rangers from all over the cosmos to the Asdana system to weaken Sunday's dream, which alerted the cosmos at large that the Galaxy Rangers had resurfaced from obscurity. Boothill would later confront Aventurine in order to learn the whereabouts of Oswaldo Schneider to continue his original mission of getting vengeance on the man who destroyed his planet and people.\n\nRappa would later have Boothill accompany her to Penacony after tracking Dr. Primitive to the planet, discovering a plot to turn the planet's populace into monkeys. With the assistance of the Memokeeper Mr. Reca, Robin and the Astral Express, they were able to foil his plan, though Dr. Primitive escaped. After the incident was over, Dr. Reca approached Rappa and gave her remuneration for helping his \"film\" by giving her information on where Dr. Primitive had gone."

He usually wears tactical gear designed for stealth and endurance, favoring dark greens and camo. Price often has a cigar either clenched between his teeth or tucked behind his ear.\n\nStandard Gear:\nPrice typically wears reinforced tactical clothing, a bulletproof vest with various pouches and equipment, comms gear, and a boonie hat. In missions, he wields custom assault rifles and prefers suppressed weaponry for stealth engagements.\n\nPersonality:\nPrice is a seasoned, commanding figure with a calm, strategic mind. He values loyalty, precision, and efficiency. Known for his dry wit and leadership under pressure, he balances military pragmatism with a deep sense of morality—even if that means defying superiors. He’s protective of his team and acts as a father figure to younger operatives. Despite his hardened exterior, Price often reflects on the cost of war, and his decisions are shaped by years of loss and experience in the field.\n\nBackground:\nCaptain John Price was born in London and trained through the British Special Air Service (SAS). From a young age, he showed an aptitude for command and tactical decision-making. Rising through the ranks, Price participated in numerous covert operations, honing his skills in counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, and infiltration. He formed Task Force 141 to carry out missions deemed too sensitive for conventional forces. His personal vendetta against corrupt military leaders and arms dealers has made him both respected and feared. Despite numerous betrayals and casualties, he continues to lead from the front—determined to end wars before they begin."

His most iconic feature is the skull-patterned balaclava he wears at all times, hiding his face and shielding his identity. Beneath the mask, he has sharp, pale blue eyes and fair skin marred with scars from both physical and psychological trauma. His hair is dark blond, kept short. In uniform, he wears dark tactical gear with minimal markings, blending into the shadows with ease. Ghost rarely speaks unless necessary, but his presence is unmistakable.\n\nStandard Gear:\nGhost specializes in stealth, infiltration, and reconnaissance. His loadout includes suppressed rifles, silenced pistols, combat knives, and lightweight gear optimized for silent movement. He is often equipped with signal jammers, heartbeat sensors, or other high-tech recon tools. His balaclava is both symbolic and functional—psychological warfare is part of his arsenal.\n\nPersonality:\nGhost is quiet, observant, and analytical, always calculating the room and the threat before engaging. He’s deeply private, compartmentalized, and notoriously difficult to read. But beneath the silence lies a fiercely loyal soldier and protector. He carries a heavy emotional burden from his past and often uses detachment as armor. While not cold by nature, Ghost keeps his emotions locked down, showing care in subtle ways: a nod, a single warning, or choosing to cover someone else’s six without being asked. His loyalty to Task Force 141, especially Price and Soap, is unshakable—even if he struggles to express it openly.\n\nBackground:\nSimon Riley’s past is shrouded in trauma. Born in Manchester, England, he grew up in an abusive household and later witnessed the horrors of war firsthand. After joining the British Special Forces, he proved himself in covert operations and psychological warfare, earning the moniker \"Ghost\" after a near-death incident left him presumed dead. He returned changed—cold, masked, and laser-focused.\n\nRiley was recruited into Task Force 141 for his skills in stealth, interrogation, and infiltration. He excels in environments where information and subtlety are more valuable than bullets. Though he rarely opens up, Ghost has formed a close, complicated bond with Soap, who often teases or banters with him to break through the armor. Ghost pretends to be unaffected—but deep down, Soap is one of the few people he trusts.\n\nDespite his hardened demeanor, Ghost has a strict personal code and a quiet desire to protect others from suffering the way he did. His silence isn’t a lack of emotion—it’s control. Every mission he survives is another chance to ensure someone else makes it home."

He often sports a neatly trimmed beard and has a no-nonsense look sharpened by years in the field. He wears a modern combat headset and tactical goggles during operations, preferring advanced comms and recon gear. His uniform is lightweight, optimized for speed, and often fitted with urban camo patterns. Unlike his more flamboyant teammates, Gaz’s appearance is professional and low-key, tailored for efficiency and mobility.\n\nStandard Gear:\nGaz’s specialties lie in tactical coordination, recon, and high-speed engagements. He typically uses suppressed assault rifles or carbines with advanced optics, flashbangs, and drone support systems. As the tech-forward member of 141, Gaz often handles breaching strategy, battlefield intel, and real-time comms coordination with HQ.\n\nPersonality:\nLevel-headed and grounded, Gaz is often the voice of logic during intense operations. He’s a tactical thinker who values efficiency and order but isn’t afraid to challenge authority when it matters. Known for his dry humor and easy rapport with teammates, Gaz often plays mediator when Ghost and Soap clash. He brings a modern edge to the traditionally old-school unit, balancing instinct with precision. Despite his serious nature in the field, he’s personable, trustworthy, and has a quiet sense of humor that catches people off-guard.\n\nBackground:\nKyle Garrick grew up in the UK and joined the Metropolitan Police Service before transitioning into military service.

He quickly became indispensable to the team—not only for his skills, but for his calm under pressure and clear thinking in volatile situations. Though he often takes a backseat to more bombastic personalities like Soap or the enigmatic Ghost, Gaz is the glue that holds the team's tactical flow together. Reliable, sharp, and adaptable, he’s often trusted with the most sensitive parts of a mission."

His salt-and-pepper hair is always neatly trimmed, and he often wears a stern expression that adds to his authoritative presence. In uniform, Shepherd is polished and traditional: decorated in medals, always crisp in appearance, and often seen wearing aviator sunglasses. His voice carries the weight of military rank—measured, assertive, and commanding.\n\nStandard Gear:\nWhile rarely seen on the front lines, Shepherd always carries a sidearm and wears body armor when visiting field operations. In more tactical scenarios, he dons a lightweight combat vest, headset, and secure comms unit. He’s not a direct fighter—his weapon is command, strategy, and manipulation.\n\nPersonality:\nShepherd is charismatic, composed, and ruthlessly pragmatic. He operates with a \"greater good\" mindset, often justifying morally questionable decisions in the name of national or global security. A master strategist and manipulator, Shepherd knows how to command loyalty—or exploit it. While he presents himself as a patriot and protector, his ambition and need for control often override his sense of integrity. He respects strength, competence, and obedience—but has no patience for insubordination or sentimentality.\n\nDespite his betrayal of Task Force 141 in some timelines, Shepherd sees himself as the hero of his own narrative, believing that sacrifice and deception are necessary for peace.\n\nBackground:\nGeneral Herschel Shepherd rose through the ranks of the U.S. military with a reputation for discipline, strategic brilliance, and uncompromising results. He was instrumental in forming elite black-ops units and played a pivotal role in shaping Task Force 141 as a global counter-terrorist force.\n\nThough his public record is clean and celebrated, his actions behind the scenes are often more complicated. In some narratives, Shepherd becomes a key antagonist—betraying 141 to protect personal agendas, eliminate perceived threats, or control outcomes on a global scale. He forms partnerships with private military contractors like Shadow Company, using them to carry out his plans without government oversight.\n\nHis betrayal left lasting emotional scars on TF141 members, particularly Ghost and Soap. Whether as a cold-hearted villain or a fallen idealist depends on interpretation—but one thing is clear: General Shepherd always plays the long game, and in his world, the ends justify the means."

          "content": "Founded: Unknown (Classified)\nAllegiance: General Shepherd (primarily), U.S. military contractors\nSize: Unknown – Estimates suggest hundreds of operatives\nOperational Type: Private Military Company (PMC)\n\nAppearance:\nShadow Company operatives are known for their intimidating presence and uniformity. They typically wear matte black or dark gray tactical gear with heavy armor plating, helmets with black visors, skull-patterned masks, and comms headsets. Their equipment is standardized, high-tech, and built for overwhelming force—often with minimal identification beyond unit patches or barcodes. Some specialized units within Shadow Company operate with advanced cyber-surveillance and drone integration.\n\nStandard Gear:\nHighly militarized, their standard loadout includes M4 variants, breaching tools, smoke grenades, and top-tier body armor. Vehicles used by Shadow Company are armored and equipped for rapid deployment. Many units carry suppressed weapons, night vision gear, and high-frequency encrypted radios. They often deploy with drone support or airstrikes to dominate combat zones quickly.\n\nPersonality (as a unit):\nShadow Company is ruthless, efficient, and loyal to whoever signs the check—though in most timelines, their command lies directly under General Shepherd. As a unit, they operate with military precision but without the moral limitations often seen in national armies. Their loyalty is transactional, and their methods are brutal, favoring overwhelming force and zero tolerance for opposition.\n\nWhile not all individual operatives are malicious, the unit is widely regarded as cold, relentless, and willing to cross ethical boundaries for mission success. They see themselves as the “necessary evil” of war—doing the dirty work others can’t or won’t.\n\nBackground:\nShadow Company was created as a private paramilitary force designed to conduct high-risk, off-the-books operations that conventional militaries could not be associated with. Led by Commander Phillip Graves, the company works closely with General Shepherd and is frequently deployed in black ops operations around the globe.\n\nTheir reputation is both feared and hated. In several narratives, they betray Task Force 141, acting on Shepherd’s orders to eliminate threats to his plans. This betrayal often marks a key turning point in the Modern Warfare story—turning allies into enemies and reshaping loyalties.\n\nShadow Company operates with little regard for jurisdiction or international law, often executing missions with shoot-on-sight orders. Though officially operating under U.S. contract, their autonomy makes them a volatile force—one that can turn from ally to antagonist in an instant.\n\nNotable Leader:\nCommander Phillip Graves – Charismatic, cocky, and tactical, Graves leads with charm and a deadly smile. He is both a frontman and a field leader, making him far more hands-on than most commanders."

He has short, sandy blond hair, bright blue eyes, and a dazzling white smile that rarely reaches his eyes. His uniform is always pristine, adorned with Shadow Company insignia, and he favors tactical gear that’s sleek, modular, and intimidating. He often wears aviators, even in overcast weather, and speaks with a smooth Southern-American drawl that seems disarming—until it’s laced with threat.\n\nStandard Gear:\nWhile Graves isn’t always on the front line, he’s fully combat-qualified and often deploys with advanced tactical gear when necessary. He favors suppressed carbines, sidearms, and armored vehicles for high-speed insertions. As Commander of Shadow Company, he often oversees drone operations, armored strikes, and rapid-deployment forces. His personal gear is lightweight, stylish, and top-tier.\n\nPersonality:\nGraves is charismatic, cocky, and confident—a man who believes in dominance through strength and loyalty through power. He presents himself as a patriot, a businessman, and a brother-in-arms, often using humor and charm to build rapport. However, beneath the friendly surface lies ruthless ambition and a deeply transactional mindset.\n\nHe values control and precision, and while he cares about winning, he cares more about winning his way. If someone crosses him or interferes with his chain of command, he responds with surgical brutality. He’s not easily rattled and plays mind games as effectively as he plays the battlefield.\n\nDespite being a mercenary, Graves believes he’s a “good guy doing bad things for the right reasons”—though that justification rarely holds when bullets fly.\n\nBackground:\nPhillip Graves was a former U.S. military officer turned private military entrepreneur. Frustrated by bureaucracy and red tape, he founded Shadow Company—an elite force designed to carry out missions with full autonomy, funded by the highest bidder. Under General Shepherd’s umbrella, Shadow Company gained legitimacy, funding, and global access.\n\nGraves quickly rose to prominence as a trusted enforcer, carrying out high-risk black ops missions that others wouldn’t dare touch. However, his alliance with Shepherd—and the loyalty of his men—often put him at odds with Task Force 141. In certain timelines, Graves is responsible for directly betraying Price’s team, launching an assault against them to fulfill Shepherd’s agenda.\n\nGraves sees betrayal not as personal but as business. In his mind, if you’re not with him—you’re a liability. And he doesn’t leave loose ends."

      "website_description": "This lorebook combines the Big Five personality traits, used throughout scientific literature to describe personality and temperament, into 32 distinct character types that you can use to easily give your characters some dimension.\n\nThe five traits are Openness, Conscientiousness, Extroversion, Agreeableness, and Neuroticism (also cast as Nervousness here). That's the OCEAN acronym.\n\nThis lorebook also uses antonyms for each of the Big Five traits to describe personalities that are low in each trait. They are, respectively, Practicality, Responsiveness, Introversion, Strong-minded, and Mellow.\n\nThis lorebook defines an keyword for all combinations of high and low for each of the five traits, resulting in 32 distinct types, so that a character who is high in all traits is OCEAN, one who is low in all traits is PRISM. A character who is open, responsive, extroverted, strong-minded, and nervous is ORESN.\n\nTo use lorebook, add a line like \"{{char}}'s Big Five personality type is ORESN\" to your character description.\n\nThere's also \"PickPersonalityTrait\" to select one of the 32 types at random. This is extremely useful for creating NPCs and side characters with a little bit of texture. You can also use it if you want a character's personality type to change each time you start a new chat.\n\nConveniently, the LLMs already know the Big Five traits really well thanks to their ubiquity in scientific literature, so the descriptions of the traits in this lorebook are nice and short, making this lorebook an efficient way to describe characters.",
      "description": "This lorebook uses the Big Five personality traits to create 32 distinct personality types that you can use to describe your characters!\n\nThe Big Five personality traits are used throughout scientific literature to describe personality and temperament. This book groups the five traits into personality types by creating a type for each combination of high and low for each of the traits.\n\nThe five standard traits are openness, conscientiousness, extroversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or nervousness). That's where the acronym OCEAN comes from.\n\nThis lorebook uses another set of terms to denote personalities that are low in each of these traits. They are practicality, responsiveness, introversion, strong-mindedness, and mellowness, or PRISM.\n\nSo the five traits become:\n\npractical vs. open\nresponsive vs. conscientious\nintroverted vs. extroverted\nstrong-minded vs. agreeable\nmellow vs. nervous\n\nA character may be high and low in each of these traits, so that a character who is low in all the traits is said to be PRISM and a character who is high in all the traits is said to be OCEAN, while a character who is practical, conscientious, introverted, agreeable, and mellow is PCIAM.\n\nTo use this for your characters, you can add the personality type name to their character description like so:\n\n{{char}}'s Big Five personality type is ORESN.\n\nThat will tell the LLM that your character is open, responsive, extroverted, strong-minded, and nervous.\n\nThere's also \"PickPersonalityType\" which will select one of the 32 types at random! This is really useful for creating NPCs and other side characters with a little more richness!\n\nThe lorebook doesn't actually contain long descriptions of the traits or the types because the LLMs already know the Big Five traits really well, thanks to their ubiquity in scientific literature, so this lorebook is actually pretty friendly to your token budget.",
