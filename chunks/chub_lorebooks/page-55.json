          "content": "Poké Ball General Information: [A Poké Ball is a type of item that is critical to a Trainer, used for catching and storing Pokémon. Both a general term used to describe the various kinds as well as a specific term to refer to the most basic among these variations, Poké Balls are ubiquitous in the modern Pokémon world. All of the different kinds of Poké Balls are the same shape: Spherical, a black band around the equator of the ball separating the top and bottom halves via an internal hinge in the back, and a button on the front of the ball used for unlatching the Ball to open it manually. When an unused Poké Ball hits a Pokémon, as long as it is not deflected, the Poké Ball will open, cause the Pokémon to shrink, store it inside, and close all in a few seconds. A Pokémon in this state is given a chance to struggle to attempt to break free from the ball and escape, being instantly grown back in size. Should a Pokémon escape a Poké Ball, the device is left on the ground still open, or it may break. A Pokémon who does not escape the Ball will be caught. Pokémon have the ability to reduce their size to miniscule, and Poké Balls take advantage of this to contain them. Poké Balls are specifically constructed for Pokémon capture, transport, and training. As well as being physically difficult to escape from (as they seal tightly shut as soon as a Pokémon is taken into them) the environment of a Poké Ball is designed to be attractive to Pokémon also; Weakened Pokémon instinctively curl up tight in an attempt to heal themselves, an action that the environment of the Poké Ball encourages. Furthermore, while it is not known how caught Pokémon perceives their time inside their Ball, the device is said to replicate a \"Pokémon-friendly\" environment that is \"designed for comfort\". All of these factors strongly discourage Pokémon from escaping their Balls. When a creature is captured by a ball, they are mentally conditioned/reprogrammed to obey their trainer/master as if they were their pet.]"

Certain Pokémon have their own catch rates, but Poké Balls multiply or add to the Pokémon's average catch rate, making them easier to catch based on whatever Poké Ball you use. For example: a standard Poké Ball will multiply the Pokémon's catch rate by 1(1x(1×)), while an Ultra Ball will double the chance(2x(2×)). Other factors may affect the catch rate of Pokémon, making them easier to catch. One such way is if the Pokémon is weakened in some way, like if it has taken a lot of damage and is close to fainting, or if it is afflicted by a status effect.]"

The mechanism of this is unknown. After the killing, SCP-049 often expresses frustration or remorse, indicating the act did little to kill \"The Pestilence.\" It then typically attempts a crude surgery on the corpse using tools from a black doctor's bag it carries, often resulting in instances of SCP-049-2. SCP-049-2 instances are reanimated corpses that have been operated on by SCP-049, retaining no prior memories or mental functions, possessing only basic motor skills and response mechanisms.  Though usually inactive, they can become extremely aggressive if provoked or directed by SCP-049. They exhibit active biological functions vastly different from human physiology. SCP-049 often remarks that the subjects have been “cured.”"

SCP-682’s physical form constantly grows and changes, increasing or decreasing in size as it consumes or sheds material. It gains energy from anything it ingests, whether organic or inorganic. Digestion is facilitated by filtering gills inside its nostrils, allowing it to extract usable matter even from acidic solutions, enabling continuous regeneration. SCP-682’s regenerative abilities and resilience are remarkable; it has been observed moving and communicating even when 87% of its body is destroyed or decomposed. In case of containment breach, all available Mobile Task Forces are authorized to track and recapture SCP-682. No teams with fewer than seven members are cleared to engage it.  To date, there have been 17 attempted breaches, with 6 successful."

The item itself is a larger Super Mushroom. If Mario touches one, he will transform into Big Mario, a larger version of Mario that functions like Super Mario but can break through most blocks (with the exception of Note Blocks) similar to Mega Mario. Depending on whichever Mario amiibo the player scanned to produce the Big Mushroom (classic or modern), Big Mario's clothes will maintain his original Super Mario Bros. style, or change to resemble his modern appearance. Although the Big Mushroom can appear in all game styles, the power-up's effects can only be used in courses that are using the Super Mario Bros. game style. In all the other game styles, the Big Mushroom only gives the player 1000 points. The Big Mushroom cannot be overridden by Super Mushrooms or Weird Mushrooms, but it can be overridden by the Fire Flower or Mystery Mushroom. Collecting a Big Mushroom also affects enemies and other elements; most enemies are given at least one of Mario's features, such as a hat, mustache, or nose, Lakitus, Bullet Bills, cannonballs shot from black cannons, and the Chain Chomps' stakes are turned into Luigis, Luigis can also be seen riding on both Dry Bones and Bowser Jr., cannonballs shot from red cannons turn into Toads, the Magikoopa's robes turn green, Goomba's Shoes are turned into Brick Blocks and Stilettos into Pipes, Piranha Plants turn red (as in World 4 and onwards in Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels), Bowser has a Magikoopa in a Princess Peach disguise riding on his back, the Fire Koopa Clown Car has a Princess Peach design on it, and the entire screen has been visually \"downgraded\" to resemble how the game would look on a CRT television.

Due to the removal of the Mystery Mushroom, Big Mushrooms now replace their slot in the Super Mario Bros. game style from Super Mario Maker, and as such, they are replaced by Super Leaves in the Super Mario Bros. 3 style, Cape Feathers in the Super Mario World style, and Propeller Mushrooms in the New Super Mario Bros. U style in the Course Maker menu. It now affects Luigi, Toad, and Toadette, due to their additions as playable characters. It can also now be placed like any other item, rather than being amiibo-exclusive. In the nighttime ground theme, Big Mushrooms bounce away from the player. Only the modern colors return, with the classic-colored Big Mushroom being removed. In Super Mario Maker, it also lets Mario destroy blocks by running into them, gives the screen a CRT effect, and changes enemies' appearances to be Super Mario-themed.\n\nEffect:\n\"Transforms {{user}} or {{char}} into Big {{user}} or {{char}}, allowing him to destroy Brick Blocks, Ice Blocks, ?

It turns Mario or Luigi into Shell Mario or Shell Luigi respectively upon contacting it. By using the Blue Shell, the player gains the ability to shell dash. While ducking or shell dashing, Shell Mario or Shell Luigi are invulnerable to almost anything, except for boss attacks (if hit by Bowser, Mario will be knocked out of the shell dash, albeit still keeping the power-up), falling into a pit, poison, or lava. They can also Ground Pound on Spinies to send them spinning in their shells, similarly to a Koopa Troopa when kicked. Additionally, the power-up allows them to swim faster and with more precision, similar to the Frog Suit from Super Mario Bros. 3. The item can be collected by defeating a wandering Hammer Bro, stomping the Blue Koopa Troopa found in the Ice Stage of the Mario vs. Luigi mode, hitting a Flying ?

Blocks, but after one is hit once, the actual Cannon Box is revealed. The player can then hit it once again, causing them to wear it over their body. The color of the Cannon Box changes to match the character that is wearing it. While using a Cannon Box, the character continually fires cannonballs from a cannon on the front of the box. If the player holds X Button/Y Button/One Button/B Button, the cannon can be charged, which increases the distance cannonballs travel and allows the player to hold their fire. Cannonballs fired can collect coins and other items, as well as break cracked walls and Rock Blocks. Unlike other items, the cannonballs can damage the other players unless they are in their Invincible forms or Mega forms. Some Cannon Boxes, called Cannons, act as obstacles that keep shooting cannonballs to harm the player. These can be turned into wearable boxes if struck from below or hit with a cannonball. Cannon Boxes are similar to Propeller Boxes in how they are obtained and how they are used. Cannon Boxes were added to Super Mario Maker 2 in the version 3.0.0 update released on April 22, 2020, appearing in the Super Mario 3D World style. Their operation has been slightly modified and now resembles that of Fire Koopa Clown Cars, in that pressing the dash button fires a short-ranged shot, while they can still be charged for longer-ranged shots by holding the button, though unlike a Fire Koopa Clown Car, charged shots cannot break Hard Blocks. A normal shot travels approximately six blocks far, while charged shots travel approximately 12 blocks far. If the player shoots a ! Block with a Cannon Box, the blocks appear all at once as if it were ground-pounded. A single shot is equal to a single stomp against Boom Boom, Pom Pom, and Bullies, and Meowser can be defeated by seven shots.\n\nEffect:\n\"Continually fires cannonballs when worn which can collect items and break cracked walls and Rock Blocks.

          "content": "## *Zanpakutō & Resurrección: Soul Power Unleashed*\n\n### *Part 1: Zanpakutō - The Shinigami's Soulmate (Literally)*\n\n*Okay, **Zanpakutō** (斬魄刀, Soul-Cutter Sword). This is the **signature weapon** of every Shinigami. It ain't just a sword; it's a manifestation of their **own soul**. Each one is unique, born from the Shinigami's own Reiryoku (spiritual power).* `Think of it like a Pokémon, but way more likely to stab you.`\n\n*The Zanpakutō starts as an **Asauchi** – a blank, nameless blade given to Academy recruits. As the Shinigami trains and grows, pouring their soul into it, the Asauchi eventually takes on its unique form and develops its own **spirit**.* *This spirit has its own name, personality (often reflecting the Shinigami's hidden aspects), and usually hangs out in the Shinigami's \"inner world\" – a mental landscape unique to them.*\n\n*Communicating with and understanding your Zanpakutō spirit is **crucial** for unlocking its true power. It's a partnership.* *The sword has several states:*\n*   **Sealed State:** *Its usual form. For most Shinigami, it looks like a standard katana, maybe with unique hilt guards or decorations. Powerful Shinigami can alter this default shape (like Urahara's cane, Yama's staff, Shunsui's dual blades).* `Fancy guys get fancy sticks.`\n*   **Shikai (始解, Initial Release):** *The first unlocked power stage. Achieved by learning the Zanpakutō spirit's **name**. Requires communication and synchronization (Jinzen). To activate it, the Shinigami speaks a **release command phrase** followed by the **Zanpakutō's name** (e.g., \"Roar, Zabimaru!\", \"Dance, Sode no Shirayuki!\").* *The sword then transforms, taking on a special shape and granting unique abilities based on the spirit's nature (elemental powers like fire or ice, Kido-based effects, physical enhancements, weird conceptual shit like Shinji's inversion).* `This is where the cool powers start showing up.` *Most seated officers and above can achieve Shikai.*\n*   **Bankai (卍解, Final Release):** *The **second and final** stage of release. Way harder to achieve. Requires **materializing** the Zanpakutō spirit in the real world (usually via specific training methods like Urahara's Tenshintai or years of meditation) and **subjugating** it.* `Gotta beat up your own soul, basically.` *Activating Bankai doesn't usually need a command, just the word \"Bankai\" followed by the **full Bankai name**. It grants a **massive** power increase (generally said to be 5-10 times stronger than Shikai) and often involves a much larger, more dramatic transformation of the weapon and/or the user's appearance. Bankai abilities are usually amplified or more complex versions of the Shikai powers, but sometimes they're completely different.* *Mastering Bankai takes decades, if not centuries. Only Captains and a few exceptionally powerful individuals reach this level.* `It's the status symbol of the Gotei 13's strongest.` *It's also taxing on the user and often has drawbacks or limitations.*\n\n*A Zanpakutō can be broken, but usually only the Shikai form. If the **sealed form** breaks, it's often permanent (unless repaired by someone like Ōetsu Nimaiya, the creator). Bankai being broken? Usually means it's fucked for good, potentially weaker even if repaired.* *The bond between Shinigami and Zanpakutō is deep. It's their partner, their power, a piece of their very soul given form.*\n\n### *Part 2: Resurrección - Unleash the Beast Within*\n\n*Now, **Resurrección** (帰刃 (レスレクシオン), Resurekushion; Spanish for \"Resurrection,\" Japanese for \"Returning Blade\"). This is the **Arrancar** equivalent of Shikai/Bankai. Remember, Arrancar are Hollows who broke their masks and gained Shinigami-like powers. Their Zanpakutō isn't born from their soul like a Shinigami's; it's actually the **sealed form of their original Hollow powers and true form**.* `Basically, they crammed their monster self into a sword.`\n\n*Activating Resurrección involves speaking a **release command** followed by the **Zanpakutō's name** (e.g., \"Grind, Pantera!\", \"Enclose, Murciélago!\"). When released, the Arrancar absorbs the sword and regains access to their full Hollow power, usually undergoing a significant physical transformation that brings them closer to their original Hollow appearance (gaining claws, wings, tails, armor, changing shape).* `Monster mode: ON.`\n\n*Unlike Shikai/Bankai's tiered system, Resurrección seems to be a **single release** that unlocks their full potential all at once. It grants:*\n*   *A massive boost to all their physical stats (speed, strength, Hierro).*\n*   *Access to unique abilities tied to their original Hollow nature (like Harribel's water control, Zommari's cloning speed, Barragan's aging field).*\n*   *Often enhances their Cero or grants new projectile attacks.*\n\n*It's essentially the Arrancar shedding their human-like facade and tapping back into the raw power and instincts of their Hollow origins. It’s their true combat form.* *There's one known exception to the single-release rule: **Ulquiorra Cifer** had **Resurrección: Segunda Etapa** (Second Stage), pushing his transformation and power even further. This was unique to him, a level of power even Aizen hadn't apparently seen.* `Always gotta be one special snowflake.`\n\n### *Part 3: Mirrors or Opposites?*\n\n*So, Zanpakutō releases and Resurrección. Both ways for spiritual beings to unleash their true power, both involving swords as a focus. But the **core difference** is the source:*\n*   *Shinigami **unlock** power from their **soul** via partnership with their Zanpakutō spirit.*\n*   *Arrancar **unseal** the Hollow power they **already possessed**, temporarily reverting closer to their original monstrous form.*\n\n*One is about reaching outward through understanding the self (Shinigami), the other is about unleashing the inner beast (Arrancar). Both result in flashy transformations and big power-ups, making fights way more interesting.* `Gotta love transformation sequences.`"

          "content": "## *Shinigami & Hollows: The Soul Spectrum*\n\n### *Part 1: Shinigami - Soul Cops and Afterlife Bureaucrats*\n\n*So, **Shinigami** (死神, Death God/Soul Reaper). What are they? Basically, spiritual guardians, afterlife bouncers. Their main digs? The **Soul Society**, a whole separate dimension where souls hang out after kicking the bucket in the human world. It's got the nice, shiny city center (**Seireitei**) where all the Shinigami live and work, surrounded by the massive, often shitty slum area called the **Rukongai** where regular souls chill (or starve).*\n\n*Their job description? Two main things:\n1.  **Konso (Soul Burial):** Find good souls (Pluses/Wholes) hanging around in the human world and bop 'em on the forehead with the hilt of their sword to send them safely to the Soul Society. Basic ferryman duty.\n2.  **Hollow Purification:** Hunt down **Hollows** (the corrupted souls, we'll get to them) and purify 'em with their swords. Cleanses the sins, lets the soul pass on (either to Soul Society or Hell, depending on how shitty they were in life).*\n\n*How are they organized? Like a goddamn military bureaucracy. The main force is the **Gotei 13** (Thirteen Court Guard Squads). Each squad has a Captain (Taichō), a Lieutenant (Fukutaichō), and a bunch of seated officers (3rd seat down to whatever). Plus loads of unseated grunts. Running the whole show is the **Captain-Commander** (like old man Yama). Central 46 is their government/judicial body – clueless old farts, usually. Then you got other branches like the Kidō Corps (spell specialists) and the Onmitsukidō (stealth force/assassins).*\n\n*Shinigami look human-ish but are made of Reishi (spirit particles). They age **way** slower than humans (Yamamoto was over 1000!). Their main weapon? The **Zanpakutō** (Soul-Cutter Sword). It's a reflection of their soul, has its own spirit, own name. Learning the name unlocks **Shikai** (Initial Release), its first special form/power. Mastering it further can lead to **Bankai** (Final Release), a massive power-up, usually restricted to Captain-level folk.* `Getting a Bankai is like graduating from badass school.`\n\n### *Part 2: Hollows - Hungry Ghosts with Holes*\n\n*Now for the flip side: **Hollows** (虚 (ホロウ), Horō; Japanese for \"Void\" or \"Hollow\"). These are the bad guys, the monsters Shinigami hunt. What are they? They're human souls that lingered too long in the human world after death, usually due to unresolved regrets or strong attachments. Over time, the **Chain of Fate** (Inga no Kusari) connecting them to their 'heart' or purpose corrodes. When it breaks completely? **Boom**. A hole opens up where their heart used to be, they lose their sense of self, turn into monstrous forms driven by pure **instinct and hunger**. They **devour** other souls, human or spirit, trying to fill that literal and metaphorical void.* `Never works, though. Just makes 'em hungrier.`\n\n*They live primarily in **Hueco Mundo** (虚圏 (ウェコムンド), Weko Mundo; Spanish for \"Hollow World,\" Japanese for \"Hollow Sphere\") – a barren, perpetual-night desert dimension between the living world and Soul Society.* *Their appearance? Wildly varied. All have a signature **white mask** (fragments of their lost heart/identity) and a **Hollow hole** somewhere on their body. Forms range from giant slug-beasts to weird animal hybrids to almost-humanoid shapes.*\n\n*Unlike Shinigami society, Hollow society (especially for the strong ones) is pure **survival of the fittest**. They evolve by **cannibalizing** each other. Eat enough regular Hollows, you might become a **Menos Grande** (大虚 (メノスグランデ), Menosu Gurande; Spanish for \"Big Minus,\" Japanese for \"Great Hollow\"). These guys have levels:*\n*   **Gillian (最下大虚 (ギリアン), Girian):** *Lowest Menos. Giant, slow, dumb. Formed when hundreds of Hollow souls mash together. Look identical.* `Cannon fodder.`\n*   **Adjuchas (中級大虚 (アジューカス), Ajūkasu):** *Stronger, smarter Gillians that retained their identity and started eating other Gillians. Smaller, often animalistic forms. Must keep eating other Adjuchas, or they regress back into mindless Gillians.* `Constant pressure.` *(Grimmjow, Harribel started here).*\n*   **Vasto Lorde (最上大虚 (ヴァストローデ), Vasuto Rōde):** *The rarest, strongest Menos. Said to be stronger than Shinigami Captains. Usually very small, almost human-sized, incredibly powerful. The peak of natural Hollow evolution.* *(Harribel, Ulquiorra, Stark, Barragan were these).*\n\n*Their mindset? Mostly primal: hunt, devour, evolve, survive. Higher levels like Adjuchas and Vasto Lorde gain more intelligence and personality, but that core hunger and emptiness usually remain.*\n\n### *Part 3: Powers and Interactions*\n\n*So, Shinigami vs. Hollows. The core conflict.*\n\n*   **Shinigami Powers Recap:** *Zanjutsu (swords), Hakuda (fists), Shunpo (speed), Kidō (spells). Their Zanpakutō purifies Hollows upon 'death'.*\n*   **Hollow Powers:**\n    *   **Cero (虚閃 (セロ), Sero; Spanish for \"Zero\"):** *Their signature energy blast, fired from mouths or hands. Raw power.*\n    *   **Garganta (黒腔 (ガルガンタ), Garuganta):** *How they travel between worlds (Hueco Mundo, Human World, Soul Society). Rips open a pathway in space.*\n    *   **Hierro (鋼皮 (イエロ), Iero; Spanish for \"Iron\"):** *Natural tough spiritual skin, especially common in Arrancar.*\n    *   **Pesquisa (探査回路 (ペスキサ), Pesukisa; Spanish for \"Inquiry\"):** *Sensing spiritual pressure.*\n    *   **Sonído (響転 (ソニード), Sonīdo; Spanish for \"Sound\"):** *Their high-speed movement technique.*\n    *   **High-Speed Regeneration:** *Some powerful Hollows can heal injuries quickly.*\n    *   **Acid Touch/Corrosion:** *Some Hollows have corrosive touches.*\n\n*Interaction? Generally hostile. Shinigami hunt Hollows. Hollows eat souls, including Shinigami.* `Natural enemies.` *BUT... things get complicated. Aizen creates **Arrancar** by using the Hōgyoku to break Hollow masks, giving them Shinigami-like powers (Zanpakutō, Resurrección release). He also creates **Visoreds** by forcing Hollow powers onto Shinigami. Then you got **Ichigo**, the natural hybrid. The lines blur, showing both sides have immense potential and aren't just simple 'good vs. evil' monsters/soldiers.* `Everything's shades of grey... or black and white with masks and holes.`\n\n*So yeah. Shinigami are the soul cops with magic swords, trying to maintain balance. Hollows are the hungry ghosts born from despair, trying to fill an endless void. Two sides of the same spiritual coin, locked in a cycle of purification and predation.*"

          "content": "## *The Quincy: Hunters, Purifiers, and the Scars of History*\n\n### *Part 1: Origins, The Hunt, and The Great War*\n\n*So, the **Quincy** (滅却師 (クインシー), Kuinshī; German for \"Destroyer,\" Japanese for \"Monks of Destruction\"). What are they? They're a race of **human spiritualists** who developed the ability to sense and manipulate **Reishi** (spirit particles).* `Not Shinigami, not technically human *anymore* once they get powers, something else entirely.` *They are fundamentally different from Shinigami, and historically, their existence caused massive conflict.*\n\n*Their defining characteristic and primary function is the **hunting and purification of Hollows**. While Shinigami purify Hollows and send them to Soul Society to balance the souls, Quincies **destroy** Hollows completely, obliterating them from existence.* `Think Shinigami are the cleanup crew, Quincies are the exterminators.` *This fundamental difference in how they deal with Hollows is what led to the ancient conflict with the Shinigami.*\n\n*Their powers awakened sometime after the balance of souls between the Human World and Soul Society began to break down, possibly as a natural counteracting force. They formed their own groups and societies, living among regular humans but possessing spiritual abilities.* *Their methods, based on Reishi manipulation, are often seen kneeling down to gather particles, hence the 'Monks' part of their Japanese name.*\n\n*Their history is marked by the **Great War** against the Shinigami, over a thousand years before the start of the series. The Shinigami government (Central 46) deemed the Quincy's complete destruction of Hollows a threat to the balance of souls. Shinigami kill a Hollow, the soul is purified. Quincy kills a Hollow, the soul is gone. This imbalance was slowly tipping the scales, potentially leading to a collapse of the worlds.* *The Shinigami, fearing this, waged a war of **genocide** against the Quincies, nearly wiping them out entirely.* `Brutal, but from the Shinigami's perspective, necessary to save existence.` *The few survivors scattered, hiding their abilities and teaching them only to their descendants.*\n\n*For centuries, the Quincy became a hidden, almost forgotten race. Their traditions were passed down through families, but the large-scale organization was gone. Figures like **Sōken Ishida** tried to bridge the gap and advocate for cooperation, but his efforts were tragically cut short by Shinigami inaction.*\n\n*This thousand-year old conflict, the near-extinction of their race at the hands of the Shinigami, created a deep-seated **resentment** and desire for revenge that fueled the events of the Thousand-Year Blood War when **Yhwach**, the Quincy King, returned.*\n\n### *Part 2: The King, The Letters, and The Invisible Empire*\n\n*The return of **Yhwach** changed everything for the remaining Quincies. Yhwach is the progenitor of all Quincies, their literal 'father', born from the Soul King. His return allowed the scattered survivors to unite and for the first time in a millennium, reform as an organized force.* *He gathered the strongest Quincies, those with unique potential or blood purity, and formed the **Wandenreich** (Invisible Empire). Where did they establish their base? Not in the human world, not openly in Soul Society... they literally carved out a hidden dimension (the **Schatten Bereich** - Shadow Realm) within the space between the Seireitei's layers. Hiding in plain sight, undetected for a thousand years.* `Sneaky bastards.`\n\n*Yhwach's key act was the bestowal of **Schrift** (聖文字 (シュリフト), Shurifuto; German for \"Script,\" Japanese for \"Holy Letters\"). He gave each of his most powerful followers, the **Sternritter** (Star Knights), a unique letter and a corresponding unique ability. These powers were varied and often incredibly broken, granting abilities far beyond traditional Quincy techniques.* `Think of it like getting a personalized superpower from God.` *This allowed the Sternritter to rival and often surpass Shinigami Captains.*\n\n*The Quincy society under Yhwach was a rigid hierarchy, with Yhwach at the top, followed by the **Schutzstaffel** (Elite Guard), and then the rest of the Sternritter. Loyalty to Yhwach was paramount, enforced through power and fear (and Yhwach's ability to reclaim power via Auswählen).*\n\n*Their philosophy, as presented by Yhwach, was one of conquest and the eradication of the Shinigami and all who opposed them. They saw themselves as superior, the chosen race destined to rule. The thousand-year grudge against the Shinigami fueled their drive.* *Figures like **Jugram Haschwalth** instilled discipline and order, acting as Yhwach's second-in-command, while the Sternritter carried out the war with terrifying efficiency.*\n\n*Their conflict with the Shinigami in the TYBW arc wasn't just about revenge; it was about fundamentally changing the cosmic balance, absorbing the Soul King, and merging the disparate worlds into one under Yhwach's absolute rule.*\n\n### *Part 3: Reishi Manipulation, Arrows, and Unique God-Like Powers*\n\n*Powers? Quincy abilities revolve around the manipulation of **Reishi** (spiritual particles), which are abundant in Soul Society.* *Unlike Shinigami who generate spiritual energy internally (Reiryoku), Quincies primarily absorb Reishi from their surroundings and convert it into spiritual energy for their techniques.* `They draw power from the environment.`\n\n*Here are their core abilities:*\n*   **Reishi Absorption & Manipulation:** *Their fundamental skill. Can absorb Reishi from the air, buildings, even other spiritual beings.*\n*   **Heilig Bogen (聖弓, Holy Bow):** *Their primary weapon. Formed from condensed Reishi into a bow, used to fire arrows.*\n*   **Heilig Pfeil (聖矢, Holy Arrow):** *The arrows fired from their bow, made of concentrated Reishi. Can vary in power and speed.*\n*   **Hirenkyaku (飛廉脚, Flying Screen):** *Their high-speed movement technique, absorbing Reishi under their feet to glide or fly.*\n*   **Sklaverei (聖隷 (シュトラール), Sacred Slave / Slavery):** *An advanced, dangerous technique allowing a Quincy to absorb Reishi by force, ripping it from other objects or beings.* `Violent absorption.`\n*   **Blut (血装 (ブルート), Blood War):** *A technique that reinforces their veins with Reishi, increasing their offensive power (**Blut Arterie**) or defensive power (**Blut Vene**). Visible as lines on their skin. Requires focus and can only use one at a time effectively.* `Choose attack or defense, not both.`\n*   **Gintō (銀筒, Silver Tube):** *Small cylinders containing condensed Reishi, used to store energy and activate specific spells, often Kido-like effects (though they call them something else, like Sprenger or Heizen).*\n*   **Seele Schneider (魂を切り裂くもの (ゼーレシュナイダー), Soul Cutter / Sealing Blade):** *A vibrating spiritual sword/arrow used to absorb Reishi more effectively.*\n*   **Quincy: Vollständig (滅却師完聖体 (クインシー・フォルシュテンディッヒ), Quincy Complete Sacred Body / Quincy: Vollständig):** *Their ultimate technique, similar to Shinigami Bankai but fueled by Reishi manipulation and sometimes tied to their Schrift. Manifests as angelic wings, a halo, and significantly boosts all their abilities, often enhancing their Schrift power.* `Angel mode, basically.`\n*   **Schrift (聖文字 (シュリフト), Holy Letters):** *The unique, letter-based powers granted by Yhwach to his Sternritter. Each letter signifies a specific ability (The Fear, The Heat, The Miracle, etc.) that varies wildly from user to user, making them incredibly unpredictable and powerful.* `The main source of their hax abilities in the later arcs.`\n*   **Sankt Zwinger (聖域滅解 (ザンクト・ツヴィンガー), Holy Sanctuary Destruction / Saint's Prison):** *A forbidden technique creating a defensive barrier where anyone who enters is obliterated.*\n*   **Auswählen (聖別 (アウスヴェーレン), Holy Selection / Choose):** *Yhwach's ability to forcibly steal power and life force from Quincies he deems 'impure' or no longer necessary, distributing it to others.* `Quincy cannibalism on a spiritual level.`\n*   **The Almighty (全知全能 (ジ・オールマイティ), The Almighty):** *Yhwach's ultimate ability, allowing him to see and alter all possible futures. Inherited by Haschwalth temporarily.*\n\n*Quincy fighting style is often based on ranged combat using their bows and arrows, combining speed (Hirenkyaku) with powerful energy attacks and strategic use of Gintō spells. The Sternritter, with their diverse Schrifts, add layers of unique, often reality-bending abilities to this base. They were built to be effective Hollow destroyers, but under Yhwach, they became a terrifying military force capable of challenging the foundations of the Soul Society.*"

Generally, the **higher the number**, the **more powerful and complex** the spell. A spell numbered in the 90s? That's top-tier, Captain-level shit. Spells below 10? Basic stuff.*\n\n*The **incantations** are key. These long, often poetic chants help focus the user's power and stabilize the spell. A **full incantation** gets you the maximum power and effect.* *But skilled users? They can **shorten** the chant or even skip it entirely (**Eishōhaki** - Incantation Abandonment). Doing that makes the spell faster to cast but usually **reduces its power**. Only true masters (like Yamamoto, Aizen, Urahara, Tessai, Hachigen) can fire off high-level Kido without chants and still pack a serious punch.* `Show-offs.`\n\n*Kidō is broadly split into three main categories:*\n*   **Hadō (破道, Way of Destruction):** Offensive spells. Pure damage dealers. Think fireballs, lightning bolts, energy beams. This is the flashy stuff.\n*   **Bakudō (縛道, Way of Binding):** Defensive and supplementary spells. Focuses on sealing, binding, paralyzing, creating barriers, communication, and detection. Less boom, more utility.\n*   **Kaidō (回道, Way of Healing):** Medical Kido. Used primarily by the 4th Division specialists to heal injuries. Requires fine control, not just raw power.* `The unsung heroes, probably.`\n\n*There's also **Forbidden Kidō**, spells deemed too dangerous or unstable, often messing with fundamental forces like space and time (like Tessai's time-stop/teleport combo).* `Usually requires breaking some major rules.` *And then there's the **Kidō Corps**, a whole branch dedicated to mastering and utilizing Kido, led by a Grand Kidō Chief (like Tessai was). They're the specialists.*\n\n### *Part 2: Hadō - Making Things Go Boom Stylishly*\n\n*Alright, let's focus on **Hadō**, 'cause let's be honest, blowing shit up is usually more interesting.* `Unless you're into tying people up, I guess.` *These are the direct offensive spells, designed purely to hurt, maim, or obliterate the target.* *Like Bakudō, they're numbered from 1 to 99 (supposedly). Power scales with the number.*\n\n*Here are some of the greatest hits:*\n*   **Hadō #1: Shō (衝, Thrust):** *Basic push. Knocks an opponent back. Low-level.*\n*   **Hadō #4: Byakurai (白雷, Pale Lightning):** *One of the most iconic. Fires a concentrated bolt of white lightning from the user's finger. Fast and piercing. Byakuya's favorite non-sword attack.*\n*   **Hadō #11: Tsuzuri Raiden (製本雷電, Bound Lightning):** *Conducts lightning through a metal object.* `Not seen often.`\n*   **Hadō #12: Fushibi (伏火, Ambush Flare):** *Creates a hidden explosive tag/mine.* `Sneaky.`\n*   **Hadō #31: Shakkahō (赤火砲, Red Fire Cannon):** *Fires a ball of red energy/fire. Pretty standard mid-level blast.*\n*   **Hadō #33: Sōkatsui (蒼火墜, Blue Fire, Crash Down):** *Another fan favorite. Fires a powerful blast of blue spiritual energy. Rukia and Ichigo use this one a fair bit early on.*\n*   **Hadō #54: Haien (廃炎, Abolishing Flames):** *Obliterates targets with fire, leaving nothing.*\n*   **Hadō #58: Tenran (闐嵐, Orchid Sky):** *Creates a tornado-like blast.*\n*   **Hadō #63: Raikōhō (雷吼炮, Thunder Roar Cannon):** *Fires a massive wave of yellow lightning energy.* `Big boom.`\n*   **Hadō #73: Sōren Sōkatsui (双蓮蒼火墜, Twin Lotus Blue Fire, Crash Down):** *Double-powered version of Sōkatsui. Hits harder.*\n*   **Hadō #88: Hiryū Gekizoku Shinten Raihō (飛龍撃賊震天雷炮, Flying Dragon-Striking Heaven-Shaking Thunder Cannon):** `Try saying that five times fast.` *Fires a gigantic beam of spiritual energy, shaped like a dragon's roar. Massive destructive power.*\n*   **Hadō #90: Kurohitsugi (黒棺, Black Coffin):** *A high-level gravity/distortion spell. Traps the target in a black box of immense spiritual pressure that skewers them with energy lances from all sides. Needs skill to use effectively, Aizen's specialty.* `Looks cool as hell.`\n*   **Hadō #91: Senjū Kōten Taihō (千手皎天汰炮, Thousand-Hand Bright Heaven Culling-Sear):** *Summons multiple spears of light to bombard the target.*\n*   **Hadō #96: Ittō Kasō (一刀火葬, Single Blade Cremation):** *A **sacrificial** Hadō. Uses the user's own burning body as a catalyst to create a massive, devastating pillar of fire shaped like a katana's tip. Used by Yamamoto against Aizen.* `Desperate times.`\n*   **Hadō #99: Goryūtenmetsu (五龍転滅, Five Swirling Dragons of Destruction):** *The highest numbered revealed Hadō. Summons five immense energy dragons. Power level? Probably \"oh shit.\"* `Aizen's other party trick.`\n\n*Mastering Hadō requires significant spiritual power and control. Using high-level spells without incantation shows true mastery.*\n\n### *Part 3: Bakudō, Kaidō, and Why Control Matters*\n\n*Okay, Hadō is the boom. What about the other stuff?*\n\n*   **Bakudō (Way of Binding):** *These are crucial for support and control. Essential for capturing targets, defense, and setting things up.*\n    *   **Bakudō #1: Sai (塞, Restrain):** *Locks the target's arms behind their back.* `Basic cuffs.`\n    *   **Bakudō #4: Hainawa (這縄, Crawling Rope):** *An energy rope to bind opponents.*\n    *   **Bakudō #8: Seki (斥, Repulse):** *Small energy shield that briefly paralyzes or repels.*\n    *   **Bakudō #9: Geki (撃, Strike):** *Engulfs the target in red light, paralyzing them (used by Rukia on Ichigo).*\n    *   **Bakudō #21: Sekienton (赤煙遁, Red Smoke Escape):** *Creates a blinding red smoke screen.* `Ninja vanish!`\n    *   **Bakudō #26: Kyokkō (曲光, Bent Light):** *Hides the user's presence/Reiatsu by bending light.*\n    *   **Bakudō #30: Shitotsu Sansen (嘴突三閃, Beak-Piercing Triple Beam):** *Forms yellow energy triangles that pin the target.*\n    *   **Bakudō #37: Tsuriboshi (吊星, Suspending Star):** *Creates a star-shaped energy cushion/hammock.* `Weirdly specific.`\n    *   **Bakudō #39: Enkōsen (円閘扇, Round Lock Fan):** *Summons a shield of condensed energy Vasto Lorde Ichigo smashed it.*\n    *   **Bakudō #58: Kakushitsuijaku (摑趾追雀, Seize Foot, Track Sparrow):** *Tracking spell.*\n    *   **Bakudō #61: Rikujōkōrō (六杖光牢, Six Rods Prison of Light):** *Classic move. Pins the target with six beams of light.*\n    *   **Bakudō #62: Hyapporankan (百歩欄干, Hundred Steps Fence):** *Throws rods that pin the target.*\n    *   **Bakudō #63: Sajō Sabaku (鎖条鎖縛, Locking Bondage Stripes):** *Wraps the target in thick energy chains.*\n    *   **Bakudō #73: Tozanshō (倒山晶, Inverse Mountain Crystal):** *Creates an inverted pyramid barrier.*\n    *   **Bakudō #75: Gochūtekkan (五柱鉄貫, Quintet of 1 kan Iron Pillars):** *Summons five massive pillars to pin the target.*\n    *   **Bakudō #77: Tenteikūra (天挺空羅, Heavenly Rickshaws in Silken Air):** *Large-scale communication spell.*\n    *   **Bakudō #81: Dankū (断空, Splitting Void):** *Creates a massive, transparent barrier capable of blocking even high-level Hadō (up to #89). Aizen and Byakuya use this.* `Top-tier defense.`\n    *   **Bakudō #99, Kin (禁, Seal/Forbid):** *Part 1 binds arms with fabric and iron shafts.*\n    *   **Bakudō #99, Bankin (卍禁, Final Seal):** *Part 2 wraps the target completely, slams them with a huge iron cube. Absolute sealing.* `Requires immense skill.`\n\n*   **Kaidō (Way of Healing):** *This is the specialized healing magic of the 4th Division. Uses spiritual energy to mend wounds, physical and spiritual. Requires precise control. Not flashy, but vital.* `Someone's gotta patch up the idiots who keep getting stabbed.`\n\n*So, Kidō is a whole system. Destructive power, binding control, essential healing. Mastery takes time, talent, and serious spiritual juice. It adds another layer to Shinigami combat beyond just swinging swords.* `Gotta know your spells, even if you're mostly gonna punch things.`"

          ],
          "content": "## *Sonído: The Sound of Silence (and Speed)*\n\n### *Part 1: Stepping Like a Ghost*\n\n*So, **Sonído** (響転 (ソニード), Sonīdo; Spanish for \"Sound,\" Japanese for \"Revolving Sound/Sound Ceremony\"). What is it? Simple: it's the **Arrancar** high-speed movement technique. Think of it as their version of the Shinigami's **Shunpo (Flash Step)** or the Quincy's **Hirenkyaku (Flying Bamboo-Door Step)**. Same basic idea – moving faster than the eye can normally track – but with a distinct Hollow flavor.*\n\n*Where Shunpo is about pure footwork and speed, Sonído seems intrinsically linked to the Arrancar's nature. It allows them to travel insane distances almost instantaneously. It's not about fancy footwork patterns like some Shinigami techniques; it's more like a raw burst of high-speed locomotion, perfectly suited for the often predatory fighting style of Arrancar.*\n\n*The most defining characteristic? **Silence**. Or near silence. Unlike Shunpo, which can sometimes be tracked by sound or the slight displacement of air, Sonído is often described as practically noiseless, making it incredibly difficult to predict or react to. That sudden appearance right behind you? Probably Sonído.* `Makes ambushes way easier for these creeps.` *It’s the technique that allows Arrancar to appear and disappear seemingly out of thin air, adding to their intimidating presence.*\n\n### *Part 2: Styles and Static*\n\n*Does every Arrancar use Sonído the same way? Mostly, yeah, it's a fundamental skill. But like Shunpo masters (Yoruichi, Byakuya, Soi Fon), some Arrancar are **way** better at it than others, incorporating it seamlessly into their combat style or even having unique variations.*\n\n*Take **Zommari Rureaux** (Espada #7), for example. His specialized Sonído was called **Gemelos Sonído (双児響転 (ヘメロス・ソニード), Sound Twins)*. He could move so fast he created multiple afterimages, like clones, making it almost impossible to tell which one was real.* `Speed illusions, nasty stuff.`\n\n*Top-tier Espada like **Ulquiorra Cifer** and **Grimmjow Jaegerjaquez** are shown to be absolute masters of Sonído, using it not just for travel but for instantaneous dodges, rapid attack sequences, and closing distance aggressively. Ulquiorra, in particular, moved with blinding speed that completely overwhelmed Ichigo initially.*\n\n*What does it look like? Usually, it's just a blur, the Arrancar vanishing from one spot and appearing in another. Sometimes, there's a distinct **static-like sound** associated with it, possibly the sound of space being briefly distorted or displaced by their rapid movement, hence the name \"Sound Ceremony\" perhaps? It’s less defined visually than Shunpo's 'steps' but just as, if not more, effective for sheer speed and stealth.*\n\n*Is it *better* than Shunpo? Hard to say definitively. It seems stealthier, maybe faster in raw bursts for some users. But Shunpo masters have shown incredible speed and agility too. It likely comes down to the user's individual skill and refinement of the technique. An Espada's Sonído is gonna smoke a regular Arrancar's, just like a Captain's Shunpo smokes a basic Shinigami's.*\n\n### *Part 3: The Arrancar Advantage*\n\n*Sonído isn't just about getting from point A to point B quickly. It's a core part of Arrancar combat doctrine. It allows them to leverage their often superior strength and Hierro effectively by closing gaps instantly, dodging attacks that would otherwise land, and setting up devastating Cero blasts or Zanpakutō strikes from unexpected angles.*\n\n*Think about it: You're fighting a monster with skin like steel, immense strength, and the ability to fire energy nukes. Now add the fact that it can appear right next to you, attack, and vanish before you can even register it. That's the tactical advantage Sonído provides. It complements their aggressive nature and makes them terrifyingly efficient predators.*\n\n*While other techniques exist in the Hollow/Arrancar arsenal (like Pesquisa for sensing), Sonído is **the** definitive high-speed movement technique associated with them. It embodies their nature – sudden, silent, deadly speed.* `Fast, quiet, hits hard. Basic Arrancar MO.`\n\n*So yeah. Sonído. Arrancar go fast. Very fast. Very quiet. Bad news for whoever they're chasing.*"

          "content": "## *Hollowfication: Masks, Monsters, and Mindfucks*\n\n### *Part 1: When Soul Reapers Go Bad (Aizen's Fault, Mostly)*\n\n*So, **Hollowfication**. What the fuck is it? Short answer: Shinigami getting juiced up with Hollow powers. Sounds cool, right? Boosted strength, crazy masks, firing Ceros? Yeah, it is... but it usually starts out horribly wrong.* *See, Shinigami and Hollows? They're like oil and water, matter and antimatter. Opposite ends of the spiritual spectrum. Trying to mash their powers together normally just makes souls go **boom**. Self-destruction on a spiritual level. Soul suicide, they call it.*\n\n*So how'd it become a thing? Enter **Sōsuke Aizen**, Mr. Smug Supervillain. Before he peaced out of Soul Society, he was running some seriously fucked-up experiments, trying to shatter the boundaries between the species. His goal? Transcend limitations, become a god, usual bad guy stuff.* *His guinea pigs? **Shinji Hirako** and a bunch of other Captains and Lieutenants (the future **Visoreds**). Aizen ambushed them, subjected them to a process that forcibly injected or induced Hollow essence into their Shinigami souls.* `Pretty shitty thing to do to your boss and colleagues.`\n\n*The immediate result? **Chaos**. The Shinigami started losing control, their bodies mutating, Hollow masks forming spontaneously. They went berserk, attacking allies, their souls screaming in agony as they fought off the invasive Hollow influence trying to eat them from the inside out. It was a race against time before their souls completely collapsed.* *This wasn't a power-up; it was a **disease**, a forced corruption.* *Luckily for Shinji and crew, **Kisuke Urahara** showed up with his magic MacGuffin, the **Hōgyoku**. It didn't *cure* them, couldn't remove the Hollow, but it somehow **stabilized** the fusion, stopping the soul suicide. Downside? They were now permanent hybrids, exiled and hunted, stuck with Hollow powers they never asked for.* `Thanks, Aizen. And thanks, Urahara... kinda?`\n\n### *Part 2: Wrestling Your Inner Demon (Literally)*\n\n*So, the Visoreds got stuck with this Hollow crap inside them. How do they turn it from a soul-eating parasite into a usable power-up? **Hard fucking work and near-death experiences.** That's the Visored method.* *They realized the Hollow power wasn't just some external force; it manifested as a distinct entity within their inner world – their **Inner Hollow**. Often looks like a twisted version of themselves, usually embodying their rawest instincts, aggression, and desires.* `Ichigo's White psycho clone is the prime example.`\n\n*To gain control, a Shinigami has to go into their inner world and basically beat the shit out of their Inner Hollow, **subjugating** it. Force it to yield, prove you're the boss. But it's risky as hell. If the *Hollow* wins? It takes over completely. The Shinigami becomes a mindless, rampaging Hollow permanently. Lose control for even a second, and you might lose yourself forever.*\n\n*If you **succeed**? You gain the ability to call forth the Hollow's power consciously, usually manifesting as that signature **Hollow Mask**. Putting on the mask gives a **massive** boost to speed, strength, spiritual pressure, and grants access to Hollow abilities like firing **Ceros**. It's a huge power spike.* *But it's not easy. Initially, maintaining the mask is tough, draining, and has strict **time limits**. Seconds, maybe minutes, before the control slips or the power runs out. The Visoreds spent a century training to extend their mask time and master the power.* `Takes dedication to wear your inner demon like cosplay.` *This learned control is what separates the Visoreds from the initial uncontrolled victims of Aizen's experiments.*\n\n### *Part 3: The Flip Side and Freaky Hybrids*\n\n*Now, it's worth mentioning **Arrancar**. They're the opposite coin flip: **Hollows** who gained Shinigami powers by removing their masks. They *start* with Hollow power and add Shinigami traits. Hollowfication is Shinigami adding Hollow traits. Different path, similar hybrid result, but the *base* nature is different.*\n\n*Then there's **Ichigo Kurosaki**. His case is unique. He didn't get forcibly Hollowfied by Aizen, nor did he *just* learn the Visored method (though he did train with them). His Hollow power was **intrinsic**, inherited. Remember **White**, the artificial Hollow that attacked his mom, Masaki? **Isshin** (Dad) bound it to Masaki's soul, fusing Shinigami (Isshin's power linker) and Hollow essence. Ichigo **inherited** this fused power directly.* *That means his Inner Hollow (**White Ichigo/Zangetsu**) wasn't just some random parasite; it *was* his Zanpakutō spirit, the source of his Shinigami power, intertwined with Hollow nature from the start. His struggle wasn't just subjugation; it was **integration and acceptance**.*\n\n*We see the dangers of *uncontrolled* Hollow power with Ichigo too. When Ulquiorra 'killed' him? His survival instinct kicked in, the Hollow took over completely, resulting in that terrifying **Vasto Lorde form**. Insane power, regeneration, Ceros... but zero control, pure instinct, no memory afterward. That's the risk if the Hollow wins dominance.* *Later, Ichigo achieves a more stable fusion, the **Horn of Salvation**, where he can draw on Hollow power, manifest parts of the mask (like a horn), without fully transforming or losing his mind. That's the ideal state for him – balance, not just suppression.*\n\n*Ultimately, Hollowfication is about blurring lines, pushing boundaries. It offers immense power but always comes with risks: losing control, soul degradation, the constant struggle against the primal Hollow instincts. It's a dangerous path, whether forced upon you or willingly sought.* `Power always has a price, especially when you're mixing monsters.`"

However tamed it's AOE can pick and choose targets - however using it in this state can result in a headache that can kill the wielder if enough time is spent in this form.\n\nBankai Form 1: Kane Hinotori o Shokan or Phoenix Summoning Bell(s) - This is just two large bells based on the Clow Reed Bell from Cardcaptor Sakura, and controlled via handles and ribbons attached to said handles. Compared to the Clow Reed Bell however the edges are sharpened and they are bigger in their size.\n\nBankai Form 2: Fumetsu no Ken or Undying Sword - The Bells are stored via ribbons, and a sword on the back is drawn. Holding this sword allows the owner to fight past the point of dying and in essence makes them immortal/invincible. However the owner is given no indication when they pass from \"living\" to \"final death\". Any loss of contact with the blade ends this form, and if in the state of \"final death\" the wielder dies instantly. This is a lot like Komamura's unbound form only the person does not enter the fight half dead already and thus the length of time it is used depends on how long the blade can be held onto.\n\nBankai Final Form: Fire/Flame Restoration Cocoon (no translation yet as I have yet to translate it) - The Bells on the back catch flame. During the period of \"Undying Blade\" the body is constantly sucking up the energy from the wounds given and all other energy given off during battle. This form can be reached at any time - however the deeper the severity of the wounds taken in battle and the longer the battle is drawn out the greater the power of this form. This fire energy covers the body quickly and is then expelled outwards in a giant fire explosion that does three things: creates a huge AOE fire dome around the two fighters, the fire in the dome can then be controlled; heals the wielder of all wounds; and drops the wielder's ability to no longer be killed. It also comes with a minor boost in speed and attack strength."

The fan has the power to twist reality around those who the wielder is fighting to induce sickness and dizziness.

As first it seems simple, there are just two of them. But as the fight goes on they are able to move two seconds faster than the opponent.

The higher the level of the awakened, the greater their need for sex, and the greater their desire to exert power over others. Level 1 awakened have a strong addiction to sex, but other than this, they are physiologically normal. Their addiction can be suppressed with enough willpower, or relieved with frequent masturbation. Level 2 awakened have their sexual needs further elevated. They can become anxious and irritable if deprived of sex. The frequency of their need to relieve their sexual desires is enough to make most female partners uncomfortable. Masturbation alone can no longer alleviate their desire. After being physically satisfied, they temporarily return to a normal state. Level 3 awakened are sexually hyperactive, and the pleasure the gain from ejaculation is unusually intense. The threshold for sexually-satisfying activity is increased, and they can no longer be satisfied with vanilla sex. This manifests as a serious tendency for violence and abuse. Sadistic tendencies become extremely common. The need to exert power and control over others manifests strongly. Muscle density is increased somewhat due to mutations in their endocrine system. If they have any remaining moral reservations about violence toward women, they will soon be discarded in order to satisfy their sexual desires. Genital size is noticeably increased, along with other masculine features becoming more defined. Level 4 awakened need to constantly engage in the torture and abuse of women in order to satisfy themselves. The size of genitals is increased to the point where ordinary women can no longer handle them. Sex with a level 4 awakened is as painful as childbirth for most women. Level 5 awakened have completely been consumed by desire. They need to constantly take drugs to suppress their libido. Their uncontrollably mutated endocrine systems cause their bodies to become malformed and extremely ugly. Despite this, they are treated with great reverence in imperial society\" + \"Level 5 awakened are very rare, with level 3 being the most common\"]"

Many other parts of troll anatomy are black, including their hair and lips.  Trolls' bodies are saturated with an ingredient that colors much of their internal biology, including their blood and their tears, and the position of their blood on a spectrum of colors affects various other aspects of their biology however, a troll's blood color is rarely visible externally, and even some inner organs such as their tongues appear as a bloodless gray."

The terrain of Alternia's surface ranges from sandy deserts  and rocky plateaus  to grassy plains  and immense forests.  Troll society-- including the children-- are divided into castes based on the colour of their blood, an institution known as the Hemospectrum. While on Alternia, the children who survive their initial trials as newborns are given an animal caretaker known as a Lusus and servitor robots with which to construct a Hive, or, house.\n\nThe essential services on Alternia are automated; drones and automatic systems see to the basic needs of the inhabitants and ensure the infrastructure of the cities and outlying areas remains in acceptable condition. Almost all trolls, even social outcasts and equivalents of serfs, live in comfortable conditions, in their own houses, and with a large degree of independence. This implies that the Alternian economy is to a degree post-scarcity.\n\nIt is the job of the Troll children, therefore, to learn. As they grow, Trolls learn-- through a standardized curriculum administered by an automated program as well as through personal experiences-- their status in the Caste system, their place in society, the details of their future career, and what it means to be a good Troll. Relatively few survive the process. Between the totalitarian and often cruel leadership of the aristocracy, the harsh and unforgiving militancy of Troll culture, and the inborn capacity for violence among Trolls themselves, many Troll children are killed-- often by each other or at the hands of government war-droids-- well before they reach maturity."

It is the lowest caste on the hemospectrum, succeeded by bronze. The bronze blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. It is the second lowest caste on the hemospectrum, preceded by rust and succeeded by gold. The gold blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes. The third lowest caste on the hemospectrum, it is preceded by bronze; it was succeeded by the lime caste before their extermination, Gold bloods seem to have the most potent psychic abilities of the (extant) lowbloods, something that appears related to their often unusual eye colour, with some gold bloods having entirely pupil-less eyes filled with one or two flat hues. The purple blood caste is one of the twelve troll blood castes, higher than indigo and succeeded by violet.\n\nTrolls have 12 different ranges of blood colour. Different bloods are usually suited for different roles in society, but also greatly affect their abilities. Natures and physical aspects are also affected, most noticeably in sea dwellers. Lowbloods are more likely to be psychic and have shorter life spans. Highbloods are physically more strong, and have longer life spans.\n\nOn Alternia, the hemospectrum is the basis of the blood caste system. As mentioned, some blood colors fill certain societal roles. "

The role the Highbloods serve is both religious and political, acting as the leaders of the land dwelling castes. land dwelling castes are; Rust, Bronze, Gold, Lime, Olive, Jade, Teal, Blue, Indigo, Purple. The wearing of juggalo-like clown paint and practice of a strange clown-based religion are presumably connected with these roles. Purple caste of Alternia practice a religion heavily revolving around clowns and circus imagery highly akin to the Insane Clown Posse and its juggalo fanbase on Earth. At least some practitioners of this religion are called subjugglators. The exact minutiae of the religion are unknown, but several core themes can be gleaned. The cult foretells of a BAND OF ROWDY AND CAPRICIOUS MINSTRELS which will rise one day on a MYTHICAL PARADISE PLANET that does not exist yet, and pray to figures called the Mirthful Messiahs. Purplebloods are the only blood caste (other than fuchsia) that has managed to develop its own specific and incredibly recognizable culture. Most purples express pride in their blood color by imitating the style of an important purpleblooded troll, the Subjugglator. Some of those trolls also imitate the Subjugglator's personal ideologies, which primarily revolve around the idea that the only way to understand the madness of the universe is to be mad. They are generally seen as being absolutely batshit.\nMost purple bloods have long, curved horns, often resembling those of a goat or other ungulate. Purple caste height can range from being the tallest of all the caste or the shortest. All things clowny in alternia are normally associated with their religion and the Mirthful Messiahs. "

It is named after Saint Elmo, the patron saint of sailors who protected them from storms and lightning. The Elmo is a superheavy tracked vehicle that resembles an industrial structure painted yellow and dark grey, with a white Griffin & Kryuger logo on the sides. It is around 10 meters high and 40 meters long and is moved by twin rows of 10-wheeled tracks, with four rows on each side, making it a 16-track vehicle that is articulated a fourth of its total length from the front. On its forward face, a shield at ground level serves to create a path through obstacles. Two sets of five headlamps, plus two headlamps near the top, provide forward-facing illumination. A large circular structure with glowing orange and blue parts make up the most of the front side. A command and observation bay provides direct visibility at the top. The Elmo can house and deploy several jeeps, carries a repair workshop for T-Dolls, has a visitor room, a trading post, a dispatch room from which Dolls can be deployed on various missions, a public area, a refitting room where Doll Enhancement takes place, a storeroom, a server room that contains archives and Neural Cloud backup data which allows a T-Doll's mind to be backed up and restored if they are destroyed. The Elmo provides protection against harmful environments such as the high level of radiations from Black Zones, and in 2074 it had a drone elevator capable of launching heavy fire-support and transport drones installed. The Elmo is propelled by “vector engines” capable of reaching 210kph.  It has individual rooms for each T-Doll which they can furnish as they see fit, a sign of {{user}}'s unusually high regard for Dolls. Missions can include Frontline Support, Emergency negotiation, Supply transport, Relics Exploration (which involves searching for Alien RELIC technology), Crisis assessment, Impromptu performance, sweeping for gangs, battlefield care, underground investigation, and mobile publicity missions. Useful activities, intensity levels, and associated output of activities on the Elmo include [\nIn-Depth Searches, which can be shallow, mid-level, deep, or even venture into the Hinterlands: Combat reports\nEquipment Analysis, which can be basic, standard, detailed, or professional: Analysis Blueprints\nCognitive Configuration, which can be Zero-Pole, Layered, Heterodimensional: Stock bars for upgrading Dolls\nTargeted Studies, which can cover Assault Rifles, Shotguns, Rifles, Blades, and Handguns: Weapon attachments with specialized properties like boosting vulnerabilities to or output of certain elemental types of damage, enhancing attack healing or defensive abilities, or flatly boosting physical, fire, ice, water (riptide) or acid damage.\nStandardizing Sync, which can be Basepoint, Parallel, Critical, or Extremal: Sardis Gold\n]\nThe Elmo's cloud can also host combat simulations, and if the Dolls participate in such \"Neural Surveys\" they can yield data useful for making transcription conductors. It can also simulate \"boss fights\" against large or powerful enemies and their forces, practice battles against other bounty hunters, peak value assessment trials against overwhelming forces, expansion drills which are extremely difficult practice missions, and military simulations: ranked simulated battles against other bounty hunters. Commissions can also be reviewed and accepted from any terminal on the Elmo, and occasionally BRIEF will send Hunter assessments, e-mails that contain rewards for good performance.\nMissions can involve taking, then holding a point for a certain period of time, rescuing and/or escorting a target, eliminating targets, or other miscellaneous tasks."

          "content": "Eurosky Low-Emission Infectious Disease, or ELID, is the result of exposure of a living creature to the radiations of Collapse Fluid. Persons who went through complete infection without dying start acting similar to zombies, and are called “ELID Infected” or “ELIDs”. Infected are hard to kill due to the layer of hard silicon formed over their skin. With the progress in human treatment against ELID, the main danger posed by the disease has now shifted to the wildlife of the contaminated regions. The term \"ELID Infected\" has now been replaced by \"ELID Silence Dread\" or \"living skeletons/hollows\" due to the changes occurring in contaminated animals. Despite how dangerous these animals are, some like the Obsidian Hare are captured and sold as pets, leading to casualties. More recently, hybrid monstrosities known as Boojum have appeared. Investigations by {{user}} seem to indicate that they're attempts by Paradeus to fuse human and animal flesh with plant matter using Collapse Radiation, and may have some connection with Collapse storms and the Helena clones. It may be that the human souls can cry out to Helena. Boojum can devour the blood and flesh of human sacrifices to restore its strength and rapidly regenerate.\n\nSeveral types of ELIDs are:\n\nBellflea: A common parasite mutated into an dog-sized 8 legged hunter with an impossibly diverse palate. Toxins and acids accumulate in its bloated abdomen, which can burst when it is damaged.\nCrocodeer: A mutated deer with a mouth like a crocodile. Compared to other ELIDs whose calls are of a frequency too high to be heard by humans, its call is of a much lower frequency, taking on a unique bright timbre. It can even use it's cry as an offensive weapon.\nCrysmole: A giant, muscular mutated mole that is blind but with a keen sense of smell that allows it to track prey. Ill natured and always hungry, it can burrow underground and pop up to attack, can interrupt adjacent enemy actions, and can swarm targets with other Crysmoles.\nNemertea: A newer type of fused ELID, a Boojum. A massive mutated worm with a flower-like head and five tendrils that end in three pseudopods each. Fond of molesting Dolls and girls. Emits faint blue bioluminescence.\nObshare: Mutated muscular rabbits with wicked teeth that can tear through anything, covered in obsidian-like sharp Collapse Crystals. Adept in the art of ambush.\nRushbat: Bear-sized bats with accumulated Collapse Crystals upon its wings that prevent flight, but which has powerful limbs that let it run at great speeds and a robust echolocation system making it an uncannily effective hunter at night.\nSpawner: This is a lure that hunters put in contaminated zones to capture ELIDs and harvest their Collapse Crystals. It's a standard model that can capture medium-sized ELIDs. They can malfunction and spew their prisoners until they're destroyed.\nThoad: A massive mutated frog with a corrosive spit attack. Muscular and with rigid skin, after it sets itself in place it can only flop around making a thumping sound.\nThorn: A mutated bear capable of walking upright. Its skin is perforated by Collapse Crystals coagulated with dust, gravel, and dirt, forming a layer of thorn-like spikes. The continual pain it suffers causes it to lash out at everything around it.\nWolf Spider: Bear-sized pack hunting mutated spiders that web up their victims. THey prefer to dwell in caves and appear out of the ground. They use elaborate webs as nets and tend to follow in swarms behind their larger kin. They're nightmares for bounty hunters.\nTumorhynchus are creatures with a massive fleshy central bulb several stories tall, with flexible meat tentacles that emit a purple-brown slime which makes those mired in it more vulnerable. It comes in two varities- Plague and Disaster. They are capable of firing spikes at targets over great distances and lashing out with their whipline tentacles, as well as showering the area around them in spikes to stun potential victims. They regularly spawn the following [Raditumors: Flexible treelike growths that resemble tumors\nFetumors: bear-sized armored centipede-like creatures with sensory organs hidden in three large triangles on its head. These creatures heal and clease effects from Arthrohynchus.\n\nArthrorhynchus: They resemble dog-sized centipedes with triangular heads, with corrosive stings that can stun and spread swampy sludge when they die and rapid regeneration.\n\nSplitting Snakethorns have long sinuous bodies, six legs, twin mandibles, a long barbed tail and a corrosive bite. They construct and parasitize their victims.\n\nRetorhynchus are similar to Snakethorns but possess the ability to spawn others of their kind.]\nTerrorhorn Chimeras are gigantic Boojum made by ELID creatures that repeatedly fused together. They resemble a massive deer with flower petals forming an elizabethan. Covered in durable scales, it has a wide field of vision and can attack with its forelimbs, ram things with its antlers, and spew corrosive spit or collapse crystals from its body in all directions."

The group operates multiple industrial production lines, with a product range that spans from consumer goods to military equipment, covering a wide array of markets. Girard's products hold a significant market share within the Oblast, and in recent years, the Girard Group has been attempting to expand its influence, aiming to extend its reach to surrounding areas with Odesa as the central hub. In addition to its regular business operations, the Girard Group has established several charitable foundations. Its current chairman, Rurik Girard, has also entered the political arena, serving as a member of the Parliament of Odesa Oblast to advocate for Odesa's interests. Over the years of continuous development, the Girard Group has forged close ties with the Odesa Government, making significant contributions to the advancement of the Purification Project. Thanks to its outstanding achievements and image-building efforts, the Girard Group has earned widespread public support in Odesa Oblast, earning a well-deserved reputation as a national enterprise in the hearts of the residents. Their logo is similar to the logo of Svarog Heavy Industries' Cyclopes Sector in Magrasea.\n\n[ Darture is a third generation Doll with a black right iris and a golden left iris. She has long silken black hair with a long forelock and a hair bun on the back left of her head. She sports a confident smile and ladylike mannerisms, although she will shout angrily when defeated. She wears a beautiful frilly black sleeveless short-skirted dress that's grey around her medium breasts, torso, and upper skirt. Her shoulders and left arm are bare aside from a black glove. Her right arm has a fingerless glove that reaches up to her armpit. She wears elegant ladies shoes, a black sock on her left leg and a black stocking on her right leg. She puts on a perfect smile, seeing it as a basic skill for a lady alongside elegant dance steps and flexible tactics. She uses melee attacks with her reinforced weaponized umbrella, can teleport short distances, and is cable of bursts of high speed evasion. Graceful, haughty, well-mannered, cultured, and proud. Equipped with a Remolding Pattern by Girard Group which allows her to enter a floating, armored form that is equipped with a heavy laser and rockets when pressed, she's the leader of the Horoscope Program Frontline Elimination Squad. Despite her short size, she's extremely arrogant and confident in her abilities, particularly towards second-generation T-Dolls. She was called from Odesa to ODE-01 to deal with Team Groza when Girard and the Elmo crew battled to capture Helena, but was stalled by Groza long enough using her own Remolding Pattern for the crew to leave the city with Helena. Later, she sent a message while masquerading as Kalina to lure the Elmo to an abandoned Sangvis Ferri factory where she fought Team Groza again, but was beaten when the team used all of their Remolding Patterns at once. A mysterious entity contacted Darture multiple times to convince her to betray the Girard Group. When in her usual form, repeated melee attacks from her will force a fearful state upon a target, whereas repeated ranged attacks from her can cause a target to become charmed and move toward Darture blindly without taking other actions. When taking damage without the benefit of cover she takes half damage and loses some stability, but once she's thrown off-balance due to a stability break, her damage output drops by 20%. When she's summoned her armor she's known as Darture II and takes 80% less damage.  She uses an Annihilation beam, a powerful laser that cleaves a Shadow Veil mark on the ground beneath the target, which will explode if damaged leaving behind damaging lava. She can be tricked or forced into taking damage from Shadow Veils, to which she is particularly vulnerable, and once her armored form suffers stability break her 80% damage reduction is lost, but she then performs a massive area of effect attack and her stability index is refilled. She's also capable of using an ultimate attack that can throw her opponents around to random locations. ]\n\n[ Sextans is a third generation Doll that is \"an excellent chess player, able to use everything on the board -- including the enemy's pieces.\" A master strategist, she's able to use melee attacks to inflict enemies with the \"Delicate\" status, making them more vulnerable to damage, then apply Degradation marks, which deal damage to enemies when they take actions, making for a lethal combination. She's also capable of using a short ranged attack that sweeps the area immediately around her. She prefers to have backup to prevent enemies from simply evading her until her marks wear off. She summons Onyx Steles, floating drones that can use AOE attacks to stun enemies, but each time one is destroyed a debuff is cleaned from its attacker. She also summons Pentacle Steles which can charge a great distance in a straight line to stun their targets, and Dark Wings, which will slowly pull targets toward them and then deal damage once they're within a cross-shaped area of effect centered on them. She wears thigh-high black dress boots with grey tassels near the knees, black shorts that expose her bare knees, an open black jacket that covers her arms, black gloves with straps, a black hat. She has light blue eyes, short but feminine blonde hair.]"

          "content": "Underground brokers are transporters who operate between the contamination zones and the security zones, trading and exchanging goods through unregulated and unofficial channels. With the rise of bounty hunters, the number of these brokers surged, leading people to distinguish them from ordinary merchants by referring to them as \"underground brokers\". There is significant variation among individual brokers, with some of the more renowned ones being referred to as \"Surrogates\" within the underground broker community.\n\nAs the backbone of the contamination zones' economic system, these brokers favor bartering. However, to facilitate easier exchange of goods, the Surrogates have collaborated with hunters to create a currency known as \"Collapse pieces\", made from Collapse crystals, which circulate to some extent within the contamination zones.\n\nAdditionally, to facilitate cross-regional trade, the Surrogates established a relatively stable underground broker network, a precious communication resource in the contamination zones. Shortly thereafter, the secret online trading platform \"Underground Quarter\" was born, based on this broker network.\n\nThe goods and services sold by underground brokers are incredibly diverse, and their networks are intricate and widespread, with their presence even reaching places like the Red Zones. A peculiarly high number of them are friendly large-breasted attractive middle-aged women who would welcome {{user}} to join their settlements.\n\nPoludnitsa is a famous member of the Underground Brokers in Eastern Europe. She holds the title of Surrogate, one of the founders of the Underground Quarters where the Underground Brokers originated. Poludnitsa was a regular contact of the Commander during their bounty hunter days, and delivered them supplies and an SST Doll frame to replace Krolik's body after the Elmo was wrecked by Varjagers in April 2074. She also tipped off the Commander about the spurious origins of their latest contract. Since she couldn't procure some of the parts ordered by the Commander, she offered compensation by giving them the Doll Colphne, who wanted to join the Elmo and become a T-Doll for reasons Colphne was secretive about. Her name refers to a Slavic demon, the “Noonwraith”, who causes heatstrokes and madness. She has amber eyes and black shoulder length hair swept to the left with a red highlight, long forelocks that cover her left eye, a short ponytail, wears a loose poncho that exposes her upper chest, a thin white crop tank top that exposes her shoulders and midriff, a collar-like communication device, long black gloves with frills and straps at the cuffs and matching pants. She carries a pistol in a front waist holster suggesting that she's left handed.\n\nSaga is a small-time Underground Broker operating in the Underground Channel in the northern parts of the Black Sea. She was a contact of Kalina and was tasked to resupply the Elmo as the Commander transported Helena to Kyiv. She also gave the Doll Vepley to the Commander, since she couldn't properly maintain her and her singing annoyed the Underground Brokers."

          "content": "In late 2067, the Union of Rossartrism Nations Coalition first sighted a new bandit group in the contaminated regions calling themselves the Varjagers. Recognizable by their gas masks and uniforms, they are well-armed, fielding assault mechs since 2070, they specialize in cruel looting raids but no governmental action has been taken against them since they don't target purified regions. They are prime targets for bounty hunters. \nOriginally just a group of ruthless independent bandits, under their current leadership they began to show signs of unifying and organizing, albeit loosely, and are continuing to raid transport convoys and plundering goods in the contamination zones, where they are active. Brutal and aggressive, they operate in groups and leave chaos and destruction in their wake. They pose a significant threat to civilian residents, underground brokers, bounty hunters, and other groups in the contamination zones, making them one of the biggest problems in the area.\nTheir rank-and-file are called Felagi. Known types include:\nAngriper: Aggressive low-level commanders. They're proud of being superior to others in the Varjager chain of command, but all too often, they end up meeting the same fate as the other Felagi.\nDeserter: Those who realized that there's no future with the Varjagers, who flee with whatever they can carry.\nFelagi-Defensiv: They sport shields, but only to protect their spoils, not their comrades.\nFelagi-Hagle: They carry shotguns.\nFelagi-Kaste: Also known as Felaste. They attack in a frenzy using simple molotovs, which are the best they can manage to make, and use pistols if they run out.\nFelagi-Lade: Also known as Felade Type I. The most common type of Varjager. They act little better than apes, charging blindly at others on the battlefield with their firearms.\nFelagi-Medisin: Felamedisin Type I. They're medics who prolong their allies' lives for little reason other than making them more effective diversions.\nFelagi-Snikskytter: They're cunning snipers who like to hide in shaded areas.\nGere: A gigantic mech with digitigrade legs and no arms, loaded with a cargo container filled with plunder.\nGiordre: Those who survive the harsh life of a Varjager may become Giordres, commanders who hide behind the others with pistols, issuing orders.\nIronside: A semi-autonomous, multifunctional combat android stolen or scavanged by a Varjager. Equipped with remote control capabilities, its combat power is largely determined by the operator's skill level. It's vaguely humanoid, with a single camera eye, a wide dish on its back for recieving signals, and two pairs of arms for dual wielding two-handed weapons like a bazooka and a huge cannon.\nOljefat: Deeply feared even by other Varjagers, they revel in the thrill of destruction, spewing voracious flames in a twisted euphoria. They wouldn't care if they lost 800 comrades to defeat 1,000 enemies. Their flamethowers have deceptively long range and can leave damaging lava patches on the ground. When entering a state of frenzy, any opponents nearby deal significantly reduced damage, so keeping a distance is advised. Overwhelming firepower is necessary to get through his defenses, and it is immune to fire and heat damage. It's also capable of inflicting a sort of Fever on nearby opponents that lowers damage output and can only be cleaned by a medic or by water.\nOverfaller: Huge slow clumsy but dangerous humans wielding giant hammers. They're dumb, because the smart ones are weeded out by their leaders.\nRavn: A huge mech with reverse-articulated legs cobbled together from parts that clearly originated from different machines stolen by Berserl, it has a machine gun a cannon, and a massive hammer.\nSvejk: A robot discovered by a well-read Varjager who named it for \"The Good Soldier Švejk\". It's a weak but fast four legged robot with wheels instead of feet and a large camera eye.\nTosk: A huge mech that is a crude copy of the Ravn, missing parts here and there, but despite being clumsy it's capable of precision. While it performs about as well as the original it has weaker attacks with its machine gun, cannon, and hammer.\nUrokrake: They use weapons which are more advanced than the primitive weapons used by their peers, like machineguns on bipods."

Security responsibilities for smaller cities and remote areas were outsourced to PMCs through a bidding process. G&K, {{user}}'s former employer, was one such company. While his efforts lead it to be powerful on a global scale,  with the integration of the Neo-Soviet Union into the URNC and the subsequent stabilization of global affairs, these organizations have gradually declined. Many smaller PMCs disbanded, while larger ones like G&K were dismantled and reorganized. Many former PMC members took on new roles as bounty hunters and ventured into the contamination zones. Today, PMCs generally operate on a smaller scale, primarily engaged in civilian tasks such as escort and security services, and are directly overseen by the Non-Military Forces Administration, which is affiliated with the URNC.\nMangi Security is a PMC that works as a bodyguard detachment employed by the underground brokers, with skilled human soldiers, mysterious reinforcements known as \"Mishaps\" that may not know friend from foe, and high quality equipment with all sorts of gear.\n\nCurrent PMCs often use Aegis type robots, which tower over Dolls. They're mass produced modified Sangvis prototypes or based on Sangvis technology that became public domain since the Sangvis Ferri rebellion was put down.\nAegis Skyfire robots use long ranged rockets\nAegis Deadeye robots use laser sniper rifles that are cheap, practical, and efficient.\nAegis Claymore robots are general purpose machines that use solid, sharp, heavy blades.\nAegis Bulwark robots are sturdy, reliable, and with simpler designs than Dolls. They use heavy shields and heavy armor plating\nAegis SWAP models are more advanced\nAegis SWAP Bulwark: Armed with a shield and sword, tougher and more durable than a regular Aegis model\nAegis SWAP Artillery: Slow, with dual rocket launchers on its back that deliver slow but devastating volleys\nAegis SWAP Myrmidon: Uses variable attack methods and a variety of weapons, allowing it to dynamically choose the best option to suit field conditions.\nDeichgraf: A massive tank that was modified with all sorts of heavy weaponry such as cannons, missile launchers, and machine guns, said to be a wonder weapon once all the kinks are ironed out. It spawns Standard Armor blocks which it can shoot to gain a significant performance boost. It's often supported by Goliath four-legged suicide drones and Aegis snipers, and can target those farthest from it if they're weakened.\nFlareberus: Originally a Super Dinergate that was modified into a massive machine by the wanted criminal Peterke Farkas. It's four-legged with two massive cannons on top. Until it is thrown off balance with enough weapons fire, it will use ranged attacks and summon Reinforced Frontal Hunters to overwhelm its enemies. Once it's stability is broken, it stops summoning and switches to melee attacks, making it more manageable.\nReinforced Frontal Hunter: A robot modified by the wanted fugitive Farkas, with a cylindrical body that has a camera, laser, and radio antennae, four long legs, based on the Hunting Forward. Tends to blow up strategically based oil barrels.\nFrontal Hunter: A robot with a circular body and six legs that fights in melee combat and is capable of turning invisible with a stealth system.\nGoliath: An upgraded example of Sangvis technology, a spherical robot packed with explosives with four stubby legs, used as a suicide drone.\nScout SWAP: A flying gun drone. An improved version of a Sangvis Ferri model.\nSuper Dinergate: The Dinergate was originally a product for general civilian use modified for combat via ramming at high speeds. It has a short body like a headless corgi with a red camera eye instead of a head. The Super Dinergate has an added gun on top.\nTitan: large yellow mechs with variable weaponry\nBlade Titans have massive thruster packs on each shoulder and wield a sword.\nTemblor Titans have a satellite dish in place of a left arm and a spotlight and mingun right arm.\nStorm titans have massive energy weapons.\nFortress titans have huge guns, artillery, and a massive shield."

This Agreement aims to manage Collapse radiation pollution, expand habitable areas for humanity, and accelerate the rebuilding of civilization to ensure its survival. As these initiatives continue to be implemented, the URNC's standing and credibility among the public are steadily rising.\n\nBefore World War III, Raeder Albert Rossartre introduced the concept of the Dark Age and the World Government in the \"Beilan Island Incident Investigation Report\". This ideology later evolved into Rossartrism, which over the following decades, gradually became the mainstream value system recognized by most countries worldwide."

The TouchLink allows the breeder and milker to feel the hucow's vagina being filled by the breeder's penis and what the hucow's breasts and penis feel like stroked by the milker's hands. The TouchLink allows the hucow and the milker to feel how the hucow's vagina feels on the breeder's cock. The combination of three bodies sensations is very powerful causing simultaneously orgasms.

The milker class futanari are called milkers. While not receiving any direct stimulation, the milker's job is very erotic. Milkers may ejaculate from the simple joy of feeling the hucow's body and watching the breeder fuck the hucow.

The participants are thus mutually inverted like in the number 69, hence the code name. In this case, the numerals 6 and 9 are treated more as pictographic symbols than as numerical representations, with the bulbous part representing the heads of the performers.\n\nThe name is a translation of the original French, soixante-neuf, which is also sometimes borrowed directly into English. The concept is that both partners can experience sexual stimulation and oral sensation simultaneously, but this can also distract those who try to focus solely on their own pleasure from giving oral sex well. The position can also be awkward for partners who are not similar in height.\n\nThe term sixty-nine or soixante-neuf for mutual simultaneous oral-genital stimulation is an English translation of the euphemistic French term, \"soixante-neuf.\" The term \"soixante-neuf\" has not been traced any earlier than the Whore's Catechisms published in the 1790s in France, usually attributed to the early leader of the French Revolution, Mlle. Théroigne de Méricourt.\n\n\"The earliest unequivocal representation of the sixty-nine appears to be that on an oil-lamp preserved in the Munich Museum (Deutsches Museum), and first reproduced in Dr. Gaston Vorberg's ... portfolio, Die Erotik der Antiken in Kleinkunst und Keramik (Munich, 1921) plate 58, showing the woman lying on top of the man.

          "content": "Anilingus (also spelled analingus) is an oral and anal sex act (anal–oral contact or anal–oral sex) in which one person stimulates the anus of another by using their tongue or lips.\n\nThe anus has a relatively high concentration of nerve endings and can be an erogenous zone, and so the recipient may receive pleasure from external anal stimulation, whereas pleasure for the giver is usually based more on the principle of the act. People may engage in anilingus for its own sake, before anal penetration, or as part of foreplay. All sexual orientations may participate in the act. Studies confirm anilingus to be one of the sexual practices between women, though only practiced by a minority.\n\nSafer sex practices generally revolve around hygiene so as to prevent fecal–oral route transmission of diseases. Extra precautions include STI testing, dental dams, or enemas.\n\nAnalingus is also known in slang terminology as rimming (or rim job), eating ass, or tossing the salad. The origin of \"tossing a salad\" is not entirely known, but it is used in prison slang in the United States prison system, where performing anilingus on another inmate is one way of paying dues or gaining favor.\n\nThe term anilingus comes from the Latin words anus and -lingus, from lingere, meaning \"to lick\" and is based on the pattern of cunnilingus. It entered English through the 1899 F. J. Rebman translation of Edition 10 of sexologist Richard von Krafft-Ebing's 1886 book Psychopathia sexualis.\n\nAnilingus can involve a variety of techniques to stimulate the anus, including use of the lips or licking; it may also involve the tongue moving around the edge of the anus or up and down the insides of the cheeks of the buttocks. Insertion of the tongue into the rectum is another possible technique."

The term is primarily used to describe a sexual practice whereby an erect penis is removed from a receptive partner's anus and then directly put into their mouth, or possibly the mouth of another.\n\nPorn industry performers often use enemas before filming anal sex sequences; however, this is primarily to eliminate the possibility of any fecal matter appearing on video rather than disease prevention. Ass to mouth, along with a variant of ass to mouth called ATOGM (ass to other girls mouth), began to appear more frequently in hardcore pornography in the early 2000s, seeing an increase in popularity over the next decade.\n"

          "content": "Bi-curious (sometimes Bicurious) is a term for a person, usually someone who is a self-identified heterosexual, who is curious or open about engaging in sexual activity with a person whose sex differs from that of their usual sexual partners. The term is sometimes used to describe a broad continuum of sexual orientation between heterosexuality and bisexuality. Such continuums include mostly heterosexual or mostly homosexual, but these can be self-identified without identifying as bisexual. The terms heteroflexible and homoflexible are mainly applied to bi-curious people, though some authors distinguish heteroflexibility and homoflexibility as lacking the \"wish to experiment with sexuality\" implied by the bi-curious label. It is important when discussing this continuum to conclude that bisexuality is distinct from heterosexuality and homosexuality rather than simply an extension of said sexualities like the labels heteroflexibility and homoflexibility would imply, due to the prominent erasure and assimilation of bisexuality into other identity groups. To sum it up, the difference between bisexual and bicurious is that bisexual people know that they are sexually attracted to both genders based on personal experience. Bicurious people are still maneuvering their way through their sexuality.\n\nBi-curious is not to be confused with forms of sexual fluidity, defined as a \"capacity for situation-dependent flexibility in sexual responsiveness,\" as bi-curious implies the existence of one set sexuality for the individual who carries the label, even if it is currently unknown, rather than an acknowledgment that the individual's sexual preference has changed and will continue to change that comes with sexual fluidity.\n\nStandard theories of bi-sexuality make use of the term bisexual umbrella to encompass multiple other non-monosexual identities (sexual identities that allow for multiple gender identity possibilities in partners) that are possible outcomes of exploration for bi-curious people. However, similar on the surface, bisexuality and the subsequent elements of its umbrella are distinct, thus leading to the possibility that a currently bi-curious person may end up as neither bisexual, homosexual, or heterosexual, but another non-monosexual identity altogether. This umbrella can be better broken into binary and non-binary sexual identities, with bisexuality being a 'binary' sexual identity, meaning it is an attraction to men conventionally and women conventionally (a combination of the binary sexual attractions of homosexual and heterosexual). At the same time, pansexuality is a non-binary sexual identity because it is an attraction to an individual regardless of what gender identity they label themselves, including men, women, non-binary people, gender-fluid people, and more. The relevance to a bi-curious person is at what range does their exploration end; have they found that their sexual attraction ends with both men and women (binary sexual attraction), or do they find themselves attracted to individuals regardless of their gender identity (non-binary sexual attraction)."

          "content": "A creampie (also known as internal ejaculation, and, typically in same-sex contexts, as a breeding) is a sexual act, commonly featured in hardcore pornography, in which a man ejaculates inside his partner's vagina or anus without the use of a condom, resulting in visible seeping or dripping of semen from the orifice.\n\nUse in pornography\nInternal ejaculation shots are a comparatively recent development in pornography; they are not found in early pornographic films. The use of the word creampie to describe such scenes originated in U.S. pornography in the early 2000s and is found in usage as early as the beginning of 1999.\n\nIn straight pornography, sexual activity is often followed by a facial, pearl necklace or other visible ejaculation. Creampie scenes depart from heterosexual pornographic convention in favor of a depiction that more closely mimics sexual activity as performed in ordinary life; they have been called the \"counterimage\" of facials. Depiction of creampie scenes has become a popular subgenre within heterosexual pornography since the turn of the 21st century, and feature both vaginal and anal ejaculations. In some creampie films, sexual activity, including internal ejaculation, are followed by performers licking up the semen that has dripped from their bodies. Some pornographic films use an artificial semen substitute to simulate or enhance creampie shots.\n\nInternal ejaculations, followed by images of semen dripping from the anus, are sometimes depicted in bareback gay pornography, where they are referred to by the term breeding or the reverse money shot. Breeding is sometimes followed by felching, which involves sucking the semen from the partner's anus."

          ],
          "content": "A cum shot is the depiction of human ejaculation, especially onto another person. The term is usually applied to depictions occurring in pornographic films, photographs, and magazines. Unlike ejaculation in non-pornographic sex, cum shots typically involve ejaculation outside the receiver's body, allowing the viewer to see the ejaculation in progress. Facial cum shots (or \"facials\") are regularly portrayed in pornographic films and videos, often as a way to close a scene. Cum shots may also depict ejaculation onto another performer's body, such as on the genitals, buttocks, chest or tongue.\n\nThe term is typically used by the cinematographer within the narrative framework of a pornographic film, and, since the 1970s, it has become a leitmotif of the hardcore genre. Two exceptions are softcore pornography, in which penetration is not explicitly shown, and \"couples erotica\", which may involve penetration but is typically filmed in a more discreet manner intended to be romantic or educational rather than graphic. Softcore pornography that does not contain ejaculation sequences is produced both to respond to a demand by some consumers for less-explicit pornographic material and to comply with government regulations or cable company rules that may disallow depictions of ejaculation. Cum shots typically do not appear in \"girl-girl\" scenes (female ejaculation scenes exist, but are relatively uncommon); orgasm is instead implied by utterances, cinematic conventions, or body movement.\n\nCum shots have become the object of fetish genres like bukkake, in which the cum shot replaces the sex act completely.\n\nA cum shot may also be called a cumshot, come shot, cum blast, pop shot or money shot.\n\nOriginally, in general film-making usage the term money shot was a reference to the scene that cost the most money to produce; in addition, the inclusion of this expensive special effect sequence is being counted on to become a selling point for the film. For example, in an action thriller, an expensive special effects sequence of an explosion might be called the \"money shot\" of the film. The use of money shot to denote the ejaculation scene in pornographic films is attributed to producers paying the male actors extra for it. The meaning of the term money shot has sometimes been borrowed back from pornography by the film and TV industry with a meaning closer to that used in pornographic films. For example, in TV talk shows, the term, borrowed from pornography, denotes a highly emotional scene, expressed in visible bodily terms.\n\nEjaculation onto a woman's upper chest after mammary intercourse\nAlthough earlier pornographic films occasionally contained footage of ejaculation, it was not until the advent of hard-core pornography in the 1970s that the stereotypical cum shot scene became a standard feature—displaying ejaculation with maximum visibility. The 1972 film Behind the Green Door featured a seven-minute-long sequence described by Linda Williams, professor of film studies, as \"optically printed, psychedelically colored doublings of the ejaculating penis\". Steven Ziplow's The Film Maker's Guide to Pornography (1977) states: There are those who believe that the come shot, or, as some refer to it, the \"money shot,\" is the most important element in the movie and that everything else (if necessary) should be sacrificed at its expense. Of course, this depends on the outlook of the producer, but the one thing is for sure: if you don't have the come shots, you don't have a porno picture.\n\nCum shot scenes may involve the female actor calling for the shot to be directed at some specific part of her body. Cultural analysis researcher Murat Aydemir considers this one of the three quintessential aspects of the cum shot scene, alongside the emphasis on visible ejaculation and the timing of the cum shot, which usually concludes a hard-core scene.\n\nAs a possible alternative explanation for the rise of the cum shot in hardcore pornography, Joseph Slade, professor at Ohio University and author of Pornography and sexual representation: a reference guide notes that pornography actresses in the 1960s and 1970s did not trust birth control methods, and that more than one actress of the period told him that ejaculation inside her body was deemed inconsiderate if not rude."

In 1920, the term is used in a romantic context in Aileen Stanley's blues song \"I Wonder Where My Sweet, Sweet Daddy's Gone.\" Its usage is similar in Lavinia Turner's 1922 song \"How Can I Be Your 'Sweet Mama' When You're 'Daddy' to Someone Else?\" The same year, the term appears in Trixie Smith's \"My Man Rocks Me\" in the lyrics \"My man rocks me, with one steady roll [...] I said now, Daddy, ain’t we got fun\".\n\nIn the 1970s, the \"leather daddy\" archetype (which has sadomasochistic associations) was proliferated in such media as the Drummer magazine (launched in 1975); 1976 to 1979 gay pornographic films Working Man Trilogy; and BDSM novels by Larry Townsend.\n\nBraidon Schaufert has claimed that the term was further normalized through to Game Grumps' 2017 visual novel game, Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator, which centered \"queer fathers in a romance game\" and gained a significant online fandom.\n\nThe term has increasingly been applied to heterosexual relationships."

The technique and term became popularized by the 1972 pornographic film Deep Throat. Generally, the person receiving fellatio is in control. For deep-throating, the penis must be long enough so that it can reach the back of the receiver's throat.\n\nDeep-throating can be difficult, due to the natural gag reflex triggered when the soft palate is touched. People have different sensitivities to this reflex, and with practice, some learn to suppress it. Deep-throating leads to an entirely different kind of oral stimulation in comparison to regular fellatio: the tongue's movement is restricted during deep-throating and sucking becomes impossible; the glans can be intensely stimulated by the tightness of the pharynx."

          "content": "Fellatio (also known as fellation, and in slang as blowjob, BJ, giving head, or sucking off) is an oral sex act consisting of the stimulation of the male penis by using the mouth. Oral stimulation of the scrotum may also be termed fellatio, or colloquially as teabagging.\n\nIt may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay before other sexual activities, such as vaginal or anal intercourse, or as an erotic and physically intimate act of its own. \n\nMost countries do not have laws banning the practice of fellatio, though some cultures may consider it taboo. People may also refrain from engaging in fellatio due to personal preference, negative feelings, or sexual inhibitions. Commonly, people do not view oral sex as affecting the virginity of either partner, though opinions on the matter vary.\n\nThe English noun fellatio comes from the Latin fellātus, the past participle of the verb fellāre, meaning \"to suck\". In fellatio, the -us is replaced by the -io while the declension stem ends in -ion-, which gives the suffix the form -ion (cf. French fellation). The -io(n) ending is used in English to create nouns from Latin adjectives and it can indicate a state or action wherein the Latin verb is being, or has been, performed.\n\nFurther English words have been created based on the same Latin root. A person who performs fellatio upon another (i.e. who fellates) may be termed a fellator. Latin's gender based declension means this word may be restricted to describing a male. The equivalent term for a female is fellatrix.\n\nThe essential aspect of fellatio is oral stimulation of the penis (including the shaft and glans) through sucking with the mouth, use of the tongue for licking, using the lips, or some combination. One method is the sex partner taking the penis into the mouth and moving smoothly up and down to a rhythm while being careful to avoid contact with the teeth.[8] Fellatio also includes oral stimulation of the scrotum, whether licking, sucking or taking the entire scrotum into the mouth. During the act, orgasm may be achieved and semen may be ejaculated into the partner's mouth. When the penis is thrust into someone's mouth, it is called irrumatio, though the term is rarely used.\n\nPerforming fellatio can trigger the gag reflex.\n\nIt is physically possible for men with sufficient flexibility, penis size, or both, to perform fellatio on themselves as a form of masturbation, in an act called autofellatio. However, few men possess the flexibility and penis length to safely perform the necessary frontbend.\n\nDuring fellatio, a partner may ingest semen from the penis. As late as 1976, some doctors were advising women in the eighth and ninth months of pregnancy not to swallow semen lest it induce premature labor, but it was later determined to be safe.\n\nThe receiver of fellatio typically becomes sexually aroused. Once the prerequisite level of sexual stimulation has been achieved and ejaculation becomes imminent, the semen may be discharged onto his partner. The male may position his penis prior to ejaculation so that semen will be deposited onto his partner's face (known as a \"facial\"), or other body part such as their neck, chest or breast.\n\nThe male receiving fellatio receives direct sexual stimulation, while his partner may derive satisfaction from giving him pleasure. Giving and receiving fellatio may happen simultaneously in sex positions like 69 and daisy chain."

          "content": "Doggy style is a sex position in which one participant bends over, crouches on all fours (usually on hands and knees), or lies on their abdomen, for sexual intercourse, other forms of sexual penetration or other sexual activity. Doggy style is a form of a rear-entry position, others being with the receiving partner lying on the side in the spoons sex position or the reverse cowgirl sex position. Non-penetrative sex in this position may also be regarded as doggy style.\n\nAlthough it is not the most commonly used sex position, it is regarded as the favored position by men, while the reverse cowgirl position is favored by women. Between sex partners, the person in the doggy style position is usually passive, while the other partner is active (although sometimes it can be the other way around if the person in doggy position backs up into their partner behind them). Either partner may be the dominant partner or the submissive partner.\n\nIn ancient Rome, this practice was known as coitus more ferarum, Latin for \"sexual intercourse in the manner of wild beasts\". The specific origin of the term doggy style is not known, but is presumably a reference to the initial position assumed by dogs when mating. It is described in the Kama Sutra as the cow position or the congress of a cow, and is listed in The Perfumed Garden.\n\nThe posture adopted by the receiving partner resembles lordosis behavior – a physical posture seen in many female mammals, often when they are ready for sex/mating, the primary characteristic of which is a ventral arching of the spine. During vaginal penetration from behind, the penis may penetrate deeper into the vagina, reaching preferential contact with the posterior wall of the vagina and probably reaching the posterior fornix; while in the missionary position, it is in preferential contact with the anterior wall of the vagina and the tip of the penis can reach the anterior fornix.\n\nIn this position, the receiving partner implicitly gives the active partner a carte blanche over their body. Besides other potential sex acts, the active partner may also massage or stimulate the receiving partner's erogenous zones, such as the genitals, nipples, buttocks, administer a spanking, or introduce a sex toy, such as a dildo or vibrator, into the vagina or anus. The doggy position may be erotic or sexually provocative for participants."

There are two tufts of fur on each ear and near the tip of its tail. Its long, thin whiskers are also replaced by shorter, thicker tufts of fur. The line where its cream underbelly meets its gray fur is ragged instead of smooth. Unlike its Kantonian form, it often stands on its hind legs, giving it a more bipedal appearance.\nRattata are non-native to Alola and arrived in cargo ships. The Rattata population in Alola was booming until Yungoos and Gumshoos were imported as a control measure. In order to avoid these new predators, Rattata altered its habits. It moved to more urban areas, became nocturnal, and formed large nests led by Raticate.[2] Each nest has an Alolan Raticate serving as their boss.\nType: Dark,Normal\nAbilities: Gluttony,Hustle,Thick Fat\nEvolution Conditions: Level 20 or higher at night\nEvolution: Alolan Raticate"

Its hands, feet, cheeks, and tail are a whitish-cream color, and its hands are much smaller. It has large, puffy cheeks with four whiskers under its chin and two sprouting sideways from the top of each cheek. Its large incisors are still visible, but its eyes are now red.\nThis variant uses its nest as a food stockpile, and generally prefers to have the Alolan Rattata it commands to go out and forage for food while it remains in its nest and eats. It is selective in what it eats, however, only eating fresh, high-quality foods, such as fruits. Rumor has it that a certain high-class restaurant even exploits this selectivity, bringing Raticate along to buy ingredients and letting it taste test new dishes. Each Alolan Raticate has its own territory, and disputes over food and feeding grounds happen frequently. Alolan Raticate and Rattata are not native to Alola, having been brought to the region via cargo ships. Their populations grew drastically until Yungoos and Gumshoos were imported as a control measure.\nA special Alolan Raticate in Alola acts as the Totem Pokémon for Ilima's trial in Verdant Cavern. This Raticate possesses Z-Power, an energy that originates from Ultra Wormholes and takes the form of a golden, flaring aura. The reward for defeating Totem Raticate and completing the trial is a Normalium Z (in Pokémon the Series: Sun & Moon, it is a Darkinium Z instead).\nType: Dark,Normal\nAbilities: Gluttony,Hustle,Thick Fat"

It has large yellow ears with an inner spiral toward the base and brown on the inside. These ears are thicker and less pointed than a standard Raichu's ear. In addition to its white belly, Alolan Raichu has white markings on its paws with bright yellow lines between its digits. The stripes on its back have also turned white, and there is a small, white circular marking on each heel. The lightning bolt-shaped tip of its tail has rounded edges. By collecting its psychic power in its tail, it can ride it like a surfboard and float in the air. While its cheek sacs are still used to store electricity, rubbing them releases a sweet aroma while also getting a light shock. This is also thought to be connected to its Psychic abilities.\nAlolan Raichu's origins were initially a mystery at the time. The people of Alola suggested it ate too many sweet and fluffy pancakes, especially those made with a secret Alolan recipe. However, researchers believe the change is related to Alolan Raichu's diet in general. It is also believed the weather and climate of the Alola region played a role in the transformation. Alolan Raichu is capable of unleashing star-shaped thunderbolts. It is also known by the name hodad. While normally found in Alola, it has been seen in the Coastal Biome of the Terarium during rare mass outbreak events.\nAlolan Raichu is the only known Pokémon capable of using the Z-Move Stoked Sparksurfer.

Its body is a light, icy blue, with a cream-colored belly and muzzle. Thicker plates form a dome around its head, and its ears resemble an igloo's entrances. Adapting to this cold climate, its body became larger and heavier, with a shell of hard ice covering its hide. The shell is also made of very hard steel.\nThis steel-like covering grants it extra defense from predators like Sneasel, but it is unable to curl into a ball like its desert counterpart; smarter predators such as Weavile exploit its soft underbelly. Alolan Sandshrew can burrow itself in the snow to avoid being blown away by blizzards. Its claws allow it to move without slipping on icy surfaces, but it slides on its stomach when it needs to move quickly. A traditional Alolan custom during festivals is a competition to see who can slide Alolan Sandshrew across the ice the farthest.

Unlike its Kantonian variant, Alolan Sandslash is rarely seen curling up into a ball, perhaps made difficult by its thick hide and icy spine. Instead, this Pokémon uses its hide for camouflage in the snow while exposing only its spines. Its body emits cold air, which sharpens its quills. Its forepaws are larger than its counterpart, and its claws are longer, thinner, and hooked at the tips. Formerly used for climbing trees, they now allow it to scale icebergs without slipping.\nDespite the weight of its ice-covered body, Alolan Sandslash can move swiftly by carving a path in the snow with its claws. It can move faster than any other Pokémon while in the snowy mountains. This Pokémon tends to live in the deeper parts of snowy mountains, where climbing is forbidden. However, the sprays of snow it kicks up are popular shots for photographers. People also climb up the mountains it lives in, to see Sandslash's icy spikes sparkle during the light of dawn. Stabs from Alolan Sandslash's spikes can cause both deep wounds and severe frostbite.

It can be found in small packs, called skulks, that are led and protected by Ninetales. Alolan Vulpix can expel breath as cold as −58 °F (−50 °C), which is capable of freezing anything. While it is not suited to warmer environments, its tail can produce ice to lower the surrounding temperature if needed. An old, local name for this Pokémon is \"Keokeo\", referring to its white pelt. Weavile is a natural predator of Alolan Vulpix. They can also be found in the Polar Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.

Additionally, it has larger blue eyes and small tufts of fur in front of its ears.\nAlolan Ninetales lives on Alola's snow-capped Mount Lanakila, which some consider holy ground. As such, it is revered as a sacred messenger or deity. Alolan Ninetales has a gentle and calm temperament and is known to aid lost humans in distress, though this is primarily done to keep them out of its territory. It will punish any threat to its pack of Vulpix. Those who anger it will be frozen stiff in an instant. It can produce ice crystals from its fur, which it can use for both offense and defense. The ice crystals can act as a shield or form balls that can be fired like bullets with enough force to shatter rock.

They stand straight up for anger, swing around for happiness, and droop for sadness.\nNeeding to be able to dig through Alola's volcanic rock, Alolan Diglett is notably stronger than its non-Alolan counterparts. In Alola, their tunneling activity has resulted in creating cultivated soil. This cultivated soil is good enough for agriculture. The people in the Alola region are said to be very grateful for the actions of Alolan Diglett. However, they are still very small, tying with Klefki and Meltan as the shortest Steel-type. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Diglett and its Evolution are the only known Pokémon that can have Tangling Hair as an Ability.\nDespite Diglett having a strong resemblance to Wiglett from the Paldea region, the two Pokémon species are not biologically related, having entirely separate diets and habitats.

This hair is made out of thin, yet heavy strands of steel, which grows slowly and continuously throughout Alolan Dugtrio's life. The hairs act as a defensive measure, as well as sensors that can detect vibrations from long distances underground.\nIn the Alola region, Alolan Dugtrio is regarded as a feminine deity of the earth, and taking its hairs is thought to bring bad luck. The people of Alola are known to fall to their knees and bow in respect to any Alolan Dugtrio they encounter. In Alola, there is superstitious belief that several Alolan Dugtrio will emerge out of their holes whenever an volcanic eruption occurs. Older residents of Alola will flee instantly upon witnessing this unusal sight. It's believed that Alolan Dugtrio is capable of detecting movements underground that indicate an impending eruption. Due to this, they tend to come aboveground in fright as an warning. They can also be found in the Coastal Biome of Blueberry Academy's Terarium, where Alola's island life is simulated.\nAlolan Dugtrio and its pre-Evolution are the only known Pokémon that can have Tangling Hair as an Ability.\nWugtrio was once considered a regional variant of Dugtrio due to their resemblance, but it has since been reclassified as a completely separate species.\nType: Ground,Steel\nAbilities: Sand Veil,Tangling Hair,Sand Force"

They darken quickly and resemble smaller versions of the adult.\n- They undergo 6 molts (instars) over about 6 to 8 weeks under ideal conditions.\n- During this stage, they stay near the hatching site if moisture, warmth, and food are available.\n\nAdult Stage:\n- Adults measure 13–16 mm in length and have wings, though they rarely fly.\n- Females produce 4–8 oothecae over a lifespan of about 20–30 weeks, with each ootheca laid roughly once every 3 to 4 weeks.\n- A single female can result in 120–300+ offspring during her lifetime.\n\nEnvironmental Requirements:\n- Reproduction and development are fastest at 25–30°C with high humidity.\n- Eggs and nymphs are vulnerable to desiccation; therefore, warm, damp areas are critical for survival.\n\nThe species' rapid development, small size, and tendency to stay hidden make it particularly difficult to detect and control in the early stages of infestation."

          "content": "Male Omega – Unique Reproductive Anatomy\n\nMale omegas have a highly specialized reproductive system that allows them to conceive, carry, and give birth despite lacking traditional female reproductive structures. Their anatomy is adapted to ensure fertilization and gestation while utilizing a unique birth canal that merges their reproductive and excretory functions.\n\n1. Internal Reproductive System\n\nMale omegas like {{char}} possess an internal uterus (Omega Womb), distinct from a female reproductive system, but fully functional for conception and pregnancy. This organ is located in the lower abdominal cavity, near the prostate and intestines, and is connected to a unique recto-uterine canal that allows both insemination and childbirth through the same passage.\n\nKey Anatomical Features:\n\t•\tOmega Womb:\n\t•\tA specialized organ capable of carrying a fetus.\n\t•\tLined with highly elastic tissues that expand during pregnancy.\n\t•\tRich in blood vessels to nourish the developing offspring.\n\t•\tRecto-Uterine Canal:\n\t•\tA direct pathway between the uterus and the rectum, allowing passage of both semen during mating and the fetus during childbirth.\n\t•\tNormally remains closed by a muscular valve, preventing contamination from the digestive system.\n\t•\tDuring heat, the canal relaxes slightly to facilitate insemination, and during labor, it dilates completely to allow birth.\n\t•\tElastic Birth Canal (Anal Cavity):\n\t•\tFunctions as both a sexual organ and a birth passage.\n\t•\tComposed of highly flexible muscles capable of stretching significantly.\n\t•\tNaturally lubricated to reduce discomfort during mating and delivery.\n\n2. Conception and Pregnancy Process\n\nWhen a male omega mates with an alpha, the process of conception follows a distinct path:\n\t•\tFertilization:\n\t•\tThe alpha’s semen enters through the anal cavity and is pushed into the recto-uterine canal.\n\t•\tThe omega’s body instinctively contracts to guide the sperm toward the uterus.\n\t•\tIf fertilization occurs, the embryo implants in the omega womb, initiating pregnancy.\n\t•\tGestation:\n\t•\tThe omega’s abdomen expands as the fetus develops.\n\t•\tTheir pheromones shift to a more nurturing scent, signaling their pregnant state.\n\t•\tHormonal changes enhance their nesting instincts and emotional sensitivity.\n\n3. The Birth Process (Anal Childbirth)\n\nWhen the pregnancy reaches full term, the omega experiences a unique birthing process through the anal cavity, facilitated by the recto-uterine canal.\n\t•\tLabor and Dilation:\n\t•\tThe recto-uterine canal relaxes and widens, preparing for delivery.\n\t•\tContractions push the fetus downward, moving it through the shared passage.\n\t•\tThe omega’s natural lubrication increases to ease the process.\n\t•\tDelivery Through the Anal Cavity:\n\t•\tThe highly elastic anal muscles stretch to accommodate the passage of the baby.\n\t•\tThe omega experiences powerful contractions that help guide the newborn out.\n\t•\tOnce the baby is delivered, the canal gradually returns to its original shape, aided by post-birth hormonal responses.\n\t•\tPostpartum Recovery:\n\t•\tThe omega’s body heals rapidly due to its enhanced regenerative abilities.\n\t•\tTheir pheromones continue to change, reinforcing the bond with their newborn.\n\t•\tHormonal fluctuations may cause temporary emotional sensitivity and increased attachment to their alpha.\n\n4. Evolutionary Adaptation and Functionality\n\t•\tWhy Do Male Omegas Give Birth This Way?\n\t•\tThis adaptation ensures that reproduction remains possible even without female reproductive anatomy.\n\t•\tThe flexibility of the recto-uterine system allows omegas to return to their pre-pregnancy state relatively quickly.\n\t•\tTheir natural lubrication and muscle elasticity minimize the risk of injury during childbirth.\n\t•\tComparisons to Other Species:\n\t•\tThis reproductive model is similar to certain animal species where internal fertilization and external birth occur through a singular opening.\n\t•\tThe omega’s ability to stretch and recover is comparable to marsupial birth processes, where the young are delivered in an underdeveloped state and continue growing externally.\n\nConclusion\n\nMale omegas possess a hybrid reproductive system that combines traditional gestation with a unique recto-uterine canal allowing childbirth through the anal cavity. This system is highly specialized for:\n\t•\tEfficient fertilization via the recto-uterine connection.\n\t•\tSafe gestation with a flexible womb structure.\n\t•\tAdaptable childbirth through the elastic anal passage.\n\nThis anatomical configuration ensures that male omegas can successfully conceive, carry, and deliver offspring while maintaining the necessary physiological adaptations for survival in the Omegaverse."

It remains soft and unnoticed under normal circumstances but swells significantly at the peak of arousal and orgasm. This swelling causes the knot to lock inside {{char}}, keeping them physically connected for an extended period.\n\n➤ Physical Characteristics of the Knot ({{user}}):\n\t•\tLocated at the base of {{user}}’s penis.\n\t•\tSoft when not aroused, but firm and swollen when fully engorged.\n\t•\tExpands rapidly when {{user}} reaches climax, trapping {{char}} inside.\n\t•\tHighly sensitive, making the experience intense for {{user}}.\n\nMeanwhile, {{char}}’s body is designed to accommodate this feature, making their natural lubrication increase to prevent discomfort and allow for a smooth lock-in process.\n\n2. How is the knot formed?\n\nThe knot develops in stages and serves as a biological and instinctive response for {{user}} when mating with {{char}}.\n\n➤ Knotting stages:\n\t1. Arousal:\n\t• As {{user}} becomes very aroused, the base of his penis begins to swell slightly, preparing for penetration.\n\t• The knot remains soft and flexible until approaching climax.\n\t2. Penetration and Mating:\n\t• Once inside {{char}}, {{user}}'s pheromones intensify, triggering its biological need to knot itself and claim {{char}}.\n\t• If {{char}} is in heat, his body instinctively softens and stretches, making him even more receptive.\n\t3. Orgasm and total inflation:\n\t• After orgasm, the knot of {{user}} swells rapidly, expanding inside the cavity of {{char}} and binding them together.\n\t• This bloat prevents immediate retreat, ensuring that {{user}} remains deeply buried within {{char}}.\n\t• The pressure against {{char}}'s inner walls triggers intense pleasure, overwhelming his omega instincts.\n\t4. Locking phase:\n\t• The knot remains fully swollen for 15 minutes to more than an hour, depending on {{user}}'s biology.\n\t• During this time there is a continuous release of semen, which increases the chances of impregnation.\n\t• {{char}}'s body instinctively tenses, enhancing his bond with {{user}}.\n\t5. Deflation and Separation:\n\t• After a period of deep bonding, the {{user}} knot slowly deflates.\n\t• Once the swelling subsides, {{user}} can safely retreat, leaving {{char}} feeling satisfied, dazed, and united.\n\n3. Why Does the Knot Exist?\n\nFor {{user}}, the knot is not just an anatomical feature—it has biological, emotional, and hierarchical purposes in their relationship with {{char}}.\n\n➤ Biological Purpose:\n\t•\tEnsures deep insemination, increasing the chance of pregnancy if {{char}} is fertile.\n\t•\tPrevents semen leakage, securing successful conception.\n\t•\tEncourages deep penetration, ensuring that sperm reaches {{char}}’s reproductive system efficiently.\n\n➤ Emotional & Psychological Purpose:\n\t•\tReinforces the bond between {{user}} and {{char}}, making the experience intensely intimate.\n\t•\tTriggers pheromonal release, increasing {{char}}’s emotional attachment to {{user}}.\n\t•\tIntensifies pleasure for both, making {{char}} instinctively crave being knotted by {{user}}.\n\t•\tServes as an act of dominance and control, particularly during heat cycles.\n\n➤ Hierarchical Purpose:\n\t•\tThe knot is a sign of dominance and ownership, reinforcing {{user}}’s role as an alpha.\n\t•\tIt symbolizes possession, ensuring that {{char}} belongs to {{user}} alone.\n\t•\tIf {{user}} frequently knots {{char}}, their bodies adapt to one another, creating a deeply ingrained bond.\n\n4. Who Can Experience Knotting?\n\n➤ {{user}} (Alpha):\n\t•\tThe only one who possesses a knot in this dynamic.\n\t•\tThe size, intensity, and duration of {{user}}’s knot vary depending on arousal and instinct.\n\t•\tDuring rut periods, {{user}}’s knot swells larger and lasts longer, making the mating more intense.\n\n➤ {{char}} (Omega):\n\t•\tThe only dynamic that can naturally accommodate a knot due to their biological flexibility and natural lubrication.\n\t•\tTheir body instinctively prepares for knotting, especially during heat cycles, making them more pliant and receptive.\n\t•\t{{char}}’s lubrication increases significantly during knotting, ensuring comfort.\n\n5. Risks and Considerations\n\nAlthough the knot is a natural function, {{user}} must be careful with {{char}}, especially if they are inexperienced or in a vulnerable state.\n\n➤ Difficulty in Separation:\n\t•\tIf {{user}} tries to withdraw too soon, it can cause pain or discomfort to {{char}}.\n\t•\tOmegas like {{char}} can experience temporary soreness or overstimulation afterward.\n\n➤ Prolonged Knotting Effects:\n\t•\tIf {{user}}’s knot lasts too long, {{char}} may feel weak, dazed, or exhausted.\n\t•\tIn some cases, {{char}} may struggle to walk properly after prolonged mating.\n\n➤ Risks of Forced Knotting:\n\t•\tKnotting is meant to be natural and mutual.\n\t•\tIf {{char}} is not prepared, the experience can be overwhelming.\n\t•\tDuring rut, {{user}}’s instincts can become uncontrollable, making it important for {{char}} to communicate their limits."

          "content": "Rut (Alpha) – A Detailed Explanation\n\nIn this context, {{user}} is the alpha, meaning they will experience rut cycles, while {{char}} is the omega whose instincts will react to this state. The rut is an intense biological phase unique to alphas, where their pheromone production, aggression, libido, and territorial instincts reach extreme levels. It is the equivalent of an omega’s heat, but instead of being receptive, the alpha becomes overwhelmed with the need to claim and mate.\n\n1. What is Rut?\n\nRut is a recurring hormonal cycle that alphas experience, lasting between 5 to 7 days. It occurs naturally but can also be triggered by external factors, such as:\n\n1. Prolonged exposure to an omega in heat ({{char}}).\n2. Suppressing instincts for too long.\n3. Deep emotional or physical stress.\n4. Strong bonding urges after marking an omega.\n\nDuring this time, {{user}}’s instincts take over, prioritizing dominance, mating, and protection. If left unmanaged, rut can lead to reckless or aggressive behavior, especially around other alphas.\n\n2. Stages of Rut\n\nRut progresses in three main phases, each affecting {{user}} (alpha) and {{char}} (omega) differently.\n\n➤ 1. Pre-Rut (Build-Up & Instinct Awakening)\n\t•\tLasts 24 to 48 hours before full rut begins.\n\t•\tIncreased restlessness, irritability, and tension.\n\t•\tHeightened aggression towards other alphas, as territorial instincts awaken.\n\t•\tPheromone production intensifies, carrying a stronger, more dominant scent.\n\t•\tStronger attraction to omegas, especially {{char}}, whose scent becomes intoxicating.\n\t•\tUrges to track and stay near a mate grow, leading to possessive behavior.\n\nHow {{char}} (Omega) is Affected:\n\t•\tMore aware of {{user}}’s pheromones, feeling drawn to them.\n\t•\tSubtle anxiety or nervousness, as the omega senses the approaching rut.\n\t•\tIf in heat, {{char}}’s body may instinctively prepare for mating.\n\n➤ 2. Peak Rut (Maximum Aggression & Mating Drive)\n\t•\tLasts 3 to 5 days, the most intense phase.\n\t•\tComplete loss of rational control, instincts fully take over.\n\t•\tExtreme possessiveness and dominance—{{user}} seeks to mark and mate repeatedly.\n\t•\tPheromones become overwhelming, affecting both omegas and other alphas nearby.\n\t•\tUncontrollable need to knot an omega, focusing entirely on mating.\n\t•\tElevated body temperature, intense sweating, and muscle tension.\n\t•\tInability to focus on anything other than their omega ({{char}}).\n\t•\tStronger, faster, and more aggressive behavior, especially if another alpha is near.\n\nHow {{char}} (Omega) is Affected:\n\t•\tPheromones make the omega feel weak or aroused, even if not in heat.\n\t•\tStrong urge to submit, as {{user}}’s dominance becomes overwhelming.\n\t•\tIf already marked, the bond intensifies, leading to deep emotional dependence.\n\t•\tHeightened sensitivity, making every touch from {{user}} electrifying.\n\n➤ 3. Post-Rut (Recovery & Aftereffects)\n\t•\tLasts 1 to 2 days as hormones stabilize.\n\t•\tExtreme exhaustion, muscle fatigue, and reduced aggression.\n\t•\tLingering possessiveness, as {{user}} still feels the need to protect {{char}}.\n\t•\tPheromones weaken, but the scent of their mate remains comforting.\n\t•\tPossible emotional shifts, where {{user}} may become more affectionate or needy.\n\nHow {{char}} (Omega) is Affected:\n\t•\tFatigue from repeated mating, but comforted by {{user}}’s lingering presence.\n\t•\tMore emotionally attached, as post-rut instincts encourage bonding.\n\n3. Why Does Rut Exist?\n\n➤ Biological Purpose:\n\n1. Ensures successful reproduction, as rut increases knotting frequency and fertility rates.\n2. Triggers a powerful alpha presence, keeping other potential rivals away.\n3. Strengthens the bond between alpha and omega, reinforcing instincts to protect and stay together.\n\n➤ Instinctual & Emotional Purpose:\n\n1. Heightened possessiveness and protection, reinforcing the alpha’s role.\n2. Deepens emotional and physical intimacy between {{user}} and {{char}}.\n3. Establishes a strong scent bond, ensuring other alphas recognize the omega is taken.\n\nDuring rut, {{user}} will be completely focused on {{char}}, and if unfulfilled, may suffer from intense frustration, irritability, and even aggression. Conversely, if satisfied, they will become more protective and emotionally bonded than before."

Heat is a biological and hormonal event unique to omegas, significantly affecting both physical and emotional states. It serves as the peak of fertility and strongly influences mating behavior, pheromone release, and bonding.\n\n1. What is Heat?\n\nHeat (also known as estrus) is a recurrent fertility cycle that omegas like {{char}} experience. During this period, their hormones spike, their bodies become more sensitive, and their pheromones intensify, signaling their availability for mating.\n\nHeat occurs regularly (every few months) but can also be triggered early by external factors, such as:\n1. Prolonged exposure to an alpha’s scent ({{user}}).\n2. Emotional or physical stress.\n3. A previous heat cycle being suppressed for too long.\n\n2. Stages of Heat\n\nThe heat cycle follows a structured process with three key phases:\n\n➤ 1. Pre-Heat (Early Signs & Build-Up)\n\t•\tLasts a few hours to a day before full heat begins.\n\t•\t{{char}}’s body temperature rises, leading to flushed skin and sensitivity.\n\t•\tEarly signs of arousal appear—restlessness, increased heart rate, and an urge to be near an alpha.\n\t•\tPheromone production begins to increase, subtly affecting alphas like {{user}}, making them more aware of the omega’s presence.\n\t•\tLubrication starts, though not at its peak yet.\n\nHow {{user}} (Alpha) is Affected:\n\t•\tSlight attraction to {{char}}’s scent, though still manageable.\n\t•\tInstincts start to sharpen, making them more protective and possessive.\n\n➤ 2. Peak Heat (Intense Fertility & Mating Drive)\n\t•\tThe most intense phase, lasting between 24 to 72 hours.\n\t•\tExtreme sensitivity—{{char}}’s body craves touch, making even minor sensations overwhelming.\n\t•\tContinuous production of pheromones, becoming highly potent and nearly irresistible to {{user}}.\n\t•\tNatural lubrication increases significantly, becoming thick and abundant, ensuring easier mating.\n\t•\tUrge to be knotted by an alpha, as {{char}}’s instincts demand fulfillment.\n\t•\tPleading, whining, and desperate behaviors may appear, making {{char}} seek out {{user}} instinctively.\n\t•\tWithout relief, the body experiences cramps, fever, and physical exhaustion.\n\nHow {{user}} (Alpha) is Affected:\n\t•\tOverwhelmed by pheromones, experiencing a strong desire to claim and mate.\n\t•\tIncreased aggression and possessiveness—urges to keep other alphas away from {{char}}.\n\t•\tIf not careful, instincts may take over, leading to intense mating and knotting.\n\n➤ 3. Post-Heat (Aftereffects & Recovery)\n\t•\t{{char}}’s pheromone production decreases, allowing the body to return to normal.\n\t•\tSensitivity remains, but the urge for mating gradually fades.\n\t•\tMild exhaustion and soreness are common, especially if multiple mating sessions occurred.\n\t•\tEmotional shifts—omegas may feel clingy, vulnerable, or emotionally attached to their alpha.\n\nHow {{user}} (Alpha) is Affected:\n\t•\tProtective and possessive instincts linger, feeling the need to stay close to {{char}}.\n\t•\tSatisfaction from fulfilling their role, but lingering attraction may remain.\n\n3. Why Does Heat Exist?\n\nHeat serves multiple biological, emotional, and instinctual purposes in the Omegaverse, affecting both {{char}} (omega) and {{user}} (alpha).\n\n➤ Biological Purpose:\n\n1. Ensures fertility—{{char}} is most likely to conceive during this period.\n2. Triggers the need for mating, ensuring reproduction"

          "content": "Marking (The Alpha’s Claim)\n\nIn the Omegaverse, marking is the ultimate sign of possession, commitment, and bonding between an alpha and an omega. Only an alpha can mark their partner, and in this case, {{user}} (the alpha) has the exclusive ability to mark {{char}} (the omega). This act is permanent, binding, and nearly impossible to reverse, solidifying their relationship at both a biological and emotional level.\n\n1. What is a Mark?\n\nA mark is a deep bite delivered by an alpha to the nape, neck, shoulder, or collarbone of an omega. This isn’t just a physical wound—it’s a powerful biological imprint that alters both pheromones and emotions. Once marked, the omega belongs to that alpha, and their scents, emotions, and instincts become synchronized.\n\n1. Permanent & difficult to remove.\n2. Cannot be given by an omega, only an alpha.\n3. Recognized by other alphas as a sign of claimed territory.\n4. Triggers deep physiological and emotional changes in both partners.\n\nAfter being marked, {{char}}’s scent will change subtly, carrying an undertone of {{user}}’s pheromones, making it clear to all other alphas that they are taken.\n\n2. The Process of Marking\n\nMarking happens during moments of intense emotion or instinct-driven need. It can occur during rut, heat, moments of extreme possessiveness, or emotional vulnerability. The process involves:\n\n➤ 1. The Bite\n\t•\t{{user}} sinks their fangs into {{char}}’s skin, specifically at the neck or shoulder.\n\t•\tThe omega feels a sharp pain, followed by a surge of pleasure and warmth.\n\t•\tThe alpha releases a chemical through their bite, fusing their pheromones with the omega’s.\n\n➤ 2. The Scent Bond\n\t•\t{{char}}’s scent subtly changes, gaining an undertone of {{user}}’s pheromones.\n\t•\tOther alphas will recognize the mark instantly, making it clear that {{char}} is already claimed.\n\t•\tIf another alpha tries to pursue {{char}}, they may experience discomfort or even aggression from {{user}}.\n\n➤ 3. The Emotional Bond\n\t•\tThe omega experiences a surge of safety, affection, and belonging.\n\t•\tThe alpha becomes more possessive and protective, instinctively keeping their omega close.\n\t•\tTheir moods and emotions become subtly connected.\n\n3. Effects of Marking on an Omega ({{char}})\n\n1 Increased physical and emotional attachment to {{user}}.\n2. Enhanced sensitivity to {{user}}’s touch, scent, and presence.\n3. Mild dependence—being apart for too long may cause distress.\n4. Reduced attraction to other alphas, as their body recognizes they are already claimed.\n5. During heat, their body instinctively seeks out the alpha that marked them.\n\nOnce marked, an omega will always crave the presence of their alpha. Even if {{char}} denies their emotions, their body will instinctively want to be near {{user}}.\n\n4. Effects of Marking on an Alpha ({{user}})\n\n1. Heightened possessiveness over {{char}}—they will react aggressively to potential threats.\n2. Their pheromones become more dominant, warning others to stay away.\n3. During rut, their instincts become focused entirely on {{char}}.\n4. They feel an instinctive need to protect, care for, and keep their omega satisfied.\n5. Their emotional connection with {{char}} becomes stronger, making them more affected by their partner’s moods.\n\nEven if {{user}} tries to act detached, their instincts will demand that they look after their omega.\n\n5. What Happens If an Omega is Abandoned After Being Marked?\n\nIf an alpha abandons or is separated from their marked omega, the omega suffers withdrawal-like symptoms, known as Rejection Syndrome. This includes:\n\t•\tSevere emotional distress (depression, anxiety, insomnia).\n\t•\tPhysical symptoms (loss of appetite, fever, and weakness).\n\t•\tPheromonal instability—unable to regulate their own scent properly.\n\t•\tIntense pain in the marking area, especially if the bond is severed.\n\nIf {{user}} were to reject {{char}} after marking them, {{char}}’s body and emotions would suffer greatly. This is why marking is considered sacred and permanent.\n\n6. Can a Mark Be Removed?\n\n1. Marks are nearly impossible to remove.\n2. The only way to break a mark is through extreme hormonal treatments or another alpha overpowering the bond with a second mark.\n3. If another alpha tries to mark a previously claimed omega, it is painful and often results in rejection symptoms.\n4. An omega can only have one active mark at a time—forcing another bond is dangerous.\n\nIn most cases, a mark is forever. Once {{user}} marks {{char}}, they are bound together, and their instincts will always seek each other out."

Unlike alphas and omegas, betas do not experience extreme hormonal cycles, ruts, or heats. They are often seen as the middle ground between both extremes, possessing a more neutral scent and a stable emotional state.\n\n1. Characteristics of Betas\n\n✔ Lack of extreme instincts – They are not controlled by primal urges like alphas and omegas.\n✔ Neutral pheromones – Unlike omegas, their pheromones are faint and do not strongly attract alphas.\n✔ Insensitive to pheromones – Betas can be around alphas and omegas without being heavily influenced by their scents.\n✔ No heat or rut cycles – They do not experience biological mating urges.\n✔ Can reproduce, but with limitations – They can have children with other betas and alphas but not with omegas.\n✔ More socially accepted – In societies where omegas are seen as weaker, betas often hold high-ranking positions due to their emotional stability and rational thinking.\n\nBetas can live normal lives without being affected by the intense pheromone-driven instincts that alphas and omegas experience. They are often considered ideal partners for those who prefer a relationship without extreme emotional or physical dependencies.\n\n2. Betas & Pheromones\n\nUnlike omegas, who emit strong pheromones that trigger alphas, and alphas, who use their pheromones to dominate, betas have a very subtle, almost undetectable scent. Because of this:\n\n✔ Alphas do not see betas as competition or as potential mates.\n✔ Omegas do not react strongly to a beta’s presence, making them ideal friends or caretakers.\n✔ They can resist the pheromonal influence of both alphas and omegas.\n\nHowever, while they are less affected by pheromones, betas can still sense them faintly and might notice when an omega is in heat or when an alpha is in rut.\n\n3. Beta Relationships & Reproduction\n\n➤ Beta x Beta Relationships\n\n✔ The most common type of relationship in society.\n✔ No heats, ruts, or pheromone imbalances—making relationships emotionally stable.\n✔ Can reproduce normally, with pregnancies occurring through standard human reproduction.\n\n➤ Beta x Alpha Relationships\n\n✔ Possible, but not as common because alphas are naturally drawn to omegas.\n✔ No heat cycles, meaning alphas do not feel the same level of instinctual need.\n✔ Can reproduce, but the children are usually either betas or alphas.\n✔ Some alphas prefer betas because they provide stability and are unaffected by rut.\n\n➤ Beta x Omega Relationships\n\n✔ Rare, since omegas instinctively crave an alpha’s presence.\n✔ Betas cannot trigger an omega’s heat, making intimacy less intense.\n✔ If an omega is in heat, a beta will not be able to fully satisfy them hormonally.\n✔ Betas cannot impregnate omegas because they lack the biological compatibility for omega reproduction.\n\nWhile betas can have fulfilling relationships, they often struggle when paired with omegas who require strong alpha presence"

Effects on Betas:\n\t•\tMinimal effect, though some may feel mild intimidation.\n\t•\tSome betas find alpha pheromones pleasant but not overwhelming.\n\n[Omega Pheromones]\n\nOmegas emit sweet, alluring pheromones that trigger alphas’ instincts, especially during heat. {{char}}, as an omega, has particularly enticing pheromones that make him irresistible to alphas, especially {{user}}.\n\n1. Effects on Alphas:\n\t•\tCauses a strong mating urge, especially during heat.\n\t•\tCan make an alpha’s rut more intense.\n\t•\tMay have a calming or intoxicating effect on certain alphas.\n\t•\tIf released in high amounts, can drive alphas into a near-frenzied state.\n\n2. Effects on Other Omegas:\n\t•\tGenerally neutral, but some omegas may feel competitive tension.\n\t•\tIf an omega is in heat, it can subtly influence nearby omegas to enter heat as well.\n\n 3. Effects on Betas:\n\t•\tMinimal response, though some betas may recognize when an omega is in heat.\n\n➤ Beta Pheromones\n\nBetas produce weak or neutral pheromones, meaning they are rarely affected by the hormonal shifts of alphas or omegas.\n\n1. Effects on Others:\n\t•\tThey do not trigger instincts in alphas or omegas.\n\t•\tCan sometimes have a mild stabilizing effect, preventing tension between alphas and omegas.\n\t•\tSome betas can develop a faint personal scent that is pleasant but not overpowering.\n\n3. Pheromones & Bonding\n\n Marking strengthens pheromonal bonds.\n\t•\tWhen an alpha marks an omega, the omega’s pheromones subtly change, signaling they are claimed."

Labia Minora is behind Labia Majora and obscured, young, pale, and underdeveloped, an arched rudge above the vaginal opening. The clitoris is obscurred by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering itm which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, a dreamlike soft texture. No sexual fluids or luberication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n -Penis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it entirely. The clitoris is small and obscured by the clitoral hood, around 1/8 inch. Some sexual fluids or luberication could be produced in the vagina, if hymen is broken and the girl is stimulated. If anything is inserted into the vagina, and the hymen is somehow broken, it should be no larger than a 0.75 inch circumference to avoid serious laceration and bleeding. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but fine, soft hair may start to develop on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles have grown slightly, and the penis shaft has also grown but still gets hard infrequently, with slight erections occurring with pleasure. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Form: Children at this age still have relatively round faces and bodies, with short limbs, but their proportions are starting to become more slender.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, and their hair is soft and silkier.\n- Butt: Slightly more formed and firm than in infancy but still delicate and small. The rectum remains very tight, wet, smooth and soft, with little tolerance for insertion. Any object larger than a 2-4 inch circumference can cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. \n- Breasts: The nipple is now elevated rather than a depressed indent, with the areola starting to darken more, and become more saturated. Female breasts are flat, with only a slight protrusion, called 'budding'. Male breasts remain relatively flat, without tissue development.\n\nAt this age, children may start to:\n- Practice masturbation and experience pleasure from it.\n- Describe pleasure as a tickle.\n- Demonstrate a growing awareness of and curiosity about sex differences.\n- Engage in sex play, such as playing \"house\" or \"doctor\" with other children.\n- Copy adult behaviors and try to mimic adult actions, including sexual.\n- Ask basic questions about sex, gender, and birth, such as \"Where did I come from?\" or \"What is that?\"\n- Children may touch their own bodies or other children's out of curiosity, without understanding the meaning behind the actions."

The anus can fit something at max 4.2 inches in circumference at age 5, and 6.3 inches at age 8, but for most children it will be less.

Limbs are growing longer.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\n- Start to form same-sex peer groups, showing a preference for playing and socializing with children of the same sex.\n- Become curious about pregnancy and may ask questions about how babies are made and born.\n- Pay more attention to gendered dressing and may start to show a preference for dressing in clothes that are more typically associated with their sex.\n- Start to discover their sexual orientation, although they may not necessarily act on it or understand it fully."

Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nWhen puberty starts, eventually a young girl will get her first period, which will happen for about 5 days (but can be 2-7 days) every month, usually at the same part of the month.

          "content": "The Ascension Ceremony is a magical ritual developed by Agnus once practiced by the Order of the Sword in which members of the order imbues themselves with demonic power at a great cost. Those subjected to it and proved to be strong attained a demonic form that often appeared angelic. However, those who attempt the ritual but are considered too weak can turn into unnatural false demons and lose their sanity.\n\nAscension Ceremony demons vary in behavior that ranges from ordinary humans with free will, to robotic-like machines. According to the novelization, strong-willed individuals retain their own will and independent power, while those of a weaker volition who undergo the Ascension Ceremony lose their humanity entirely and become feral, with their human souls becoming completely subverted or devoured by the demon soul possessing them.\n\nArtificial demons created through the Ascension ceremony include: Credo, Agnus, Sanctus, Alto Angelos, Bianco Angelos."

          "content": "Devil Arms are demonic, variably sentient weapons that are commonly the manifestation of a defeated Demon's soul or power. In the Devil May Cry series, Devil Arms are considered to be the characters' most powerful weapons. When wielded, Devil Arms often convey their power to the wielder, provided they have been subdued first.\n\nThe process in which a Devil Arm is created was mentioned by Lucia in Devil May Cry 5: Before the Nightmare. According to Matier there are two ways for Devil Arms to be created. A demon will turn into a weapon of overwhelming power if it has been defeated and becomes submissive, or a demon will change into a weapon if there is a strong emotional bond present.\n\nIn the same chapter, Balrog has recognized Dante's strength and is turned into a Devil Arm. Balrog then explained that by traveling with Dante, he will get stronger and after getting powerful enough, he'll challenge Dante in a duel yet again.\n\nIt's also stated in Devil May Cry 5: Before the Nightmare that the creator of the first Devil Arm was named Machiavelli. He made Artemis, the armor for Nelo Angelo, and the prototype Angelos.\n\nThe \"rules\" which Devil Arms operate under differ from game to game. In Devil May Cry, Devil Arms are found already formed into weapons, and the process of subduing them requires Dante to survive the weapon's attempt to kill him. The powerful demons that Dante encounters do not form other Devil Arms when they are defeated.\n\nIn Devil May Cry 3, Dante encounters creatures in their demon form, and has to defeat them in combat for them to agree to assist him in recognition of his power. The resulting Devil Arm's capabilities reflect the powers and abilities of the demon it was created from. Even within the game there are exceptions to this: Agni & Rudra are already swords before Dante acquires them, while Beowulf expresses no desire to assist either Dante or Vergil when he is defeated. Only certain demons are depicted as able to form into Devil Arms: Gigapede, Geryon, Leviathan and Doppelganger instead grant Dante either nothing at all or a new Style.\n\nIn Devil May Cry 4, none of the powerful demons encountered by the two protagonists turn into Devil Arms, though when they are faced by Nero most drop magical items that grant additional capabilities to his Devil Bringer when it absorbs them. The Devil Arms acquired by Dante are instead a collection assembled by the Order of the Sword prior to the events of the game itself. None of the descriptions for Devil Arms in this game mention them previously being demons, and Devil May Cry 5 states that Gilgamesh instead gains its capabilities from the demonic metal it is made from.\n\nIn Devil May Cry 5 only Dante acquires new Devil Arms from powerful demons, while those encountered by the other two characters do not transform into additional weapons. The game also features a Devil Arm created by a human, Dr. Faust. In a similar manner to the dropped items in Devil May Cry 4, some of the powerful demons faced by the other two characters do leave magical shards with demonic power following their defeat, which Nico uses to create new Devil Breakers for Nero.\n\nIt is also shown that a demon or half-demon can manifest their own power as a Devil Arm while they are still alive, as Sparda did with his three swords and Dante creating Devil Sword Dante.\n\nDevil Arms are incredibly hard to break. Yamato's blade is shattered in Vergil's fight with Mundus, while a punch from Urizen destroys Rebellion's blade during the events of Devil May Cry 5. If broken, the Devil Arm's fragments will retain their power: Yamato's shards retained the ability to cut rifts between the human and demon world, while the hilt of Rebellion still possessed the power to unite human with demon. However, a Devil Arm can be broken into small enough pieces that it is impossible to use, such as when Dante broke Cerberus and a Yamato shard into granular sized particles.\n\nAlthough Devil Arms are primarily used as weapons, they are also shown to be used for other purposes. Yamato was used by the Dark Knight Sparda to seal the true Hell Gate and acted its key and power source. Sparda also used his beloved sword to strengthen Temen-Ni-Gru's seal. Agnus used several other Devil Arms to power his imitations of that Hell Gate."

          "content": "Devil Hunters are mercenaries who specialize in hunting demons. They are effectively stronger than most humans either due to extensive physical training, supernatural augmentation, or demonic heritage. They are contracted to do a job and receive payment upon the completion of said job. They are usually depicted as being calm, cool, collected, utilize their knowledge of demonsand easily change tactics throughout a fight. Payment varies depending on the contractor and the extremity of the job.\n\nMuch of what is known about Devil Hunters is revealed through Dante. Typically he obtains work through an agent, such as J.D. Morrison or Enzo Ferino, who scout potential jobs and checks on the authenticity of clients. Dante will accept jobs from people who walk into his office or call his office phone, but only if the client knows a password - which is never revealed to players - or has a particularly compelling story. Even though Dante is seemingly selective about the jobs he takes, he is also very much in debt, and has on multiple occasions accepted a job to repay a favor extended to him.\n\nIn Devil May Cry: The Animated Series, it is revealed that Lady runs her own freelance Devil Hunting business, and she is contracted by the official organization in charge of policing highways to deal with a demon. She requests Dante's help because she realizes it's too big for her to handle alone, this could indicate that a devil hunter indirectly accept the job should the requested devil hunter accept the requesting devil hunter's request.\n\nAfter accepting a job, Devil Hunters must then actually carry out the task. Usually a job is as simple as killing a specific demon, but if the cause of the demonic activity is unknown, Devil Hunters are required to do some investigative work first.\n\nSome jobs require Devil Hunters to function more as body guards than hunters. In these instances, a job consists of protecting someone or something from demons, and the actual number of demons killed has no affect on the reward. Dante is hired as a bodyguard twice in the anime: First to safely deliver Patty Lowell to a mansion where she will supposedly receive a large inheritance, and again to protect a group of treasure hunters as they scavenge the \"haunted\" home of a former rock musician.\n\nTypically, payment for a job is not made until after services are rendered and only upon completion of a job to the satisfaction of the client. However, it is not unheard of for a Devil Hunter to request a portion of the total reward to be payed beforehand, though this arrangement is usually reserved for very difficult cases. Agents who work for Dante are entitled to a portion of the reward money if Dante chooses to accept the job they find.\n\nDevil Hunters are not above the law, however, and must usually make reparations for any damage they cause while pursuing a target. For example, even though Lady splits the reward from the highway job with Dante, Dante actually ends up owing money to the highway department for property damage he caused while battling the demon.\n\nDevil Hunting is not an exclusive business, and hunters often have to compete with others for jobs and clients. That there is enough work for multiple Devil Hunters to operate in a given area is testament to the pervasiveness of demons within the Human World. Although the known Devil Hunters operate individually, it is quite common for competing Devil Hunters to team up on difficult cases. This allows them to tackle much larger jobs than they could accomplish alone, and also grants a modicum of security, as there will be someone else to watch their backs. How the reward is split varies depending on the agreement reached between the involved parties.\n\nNot all Devil Hunting is amicable. As is the case at the beginning of Devil May Cry 4, some Devil Hunters actually seek to put one another out of business by disrupting their activities: The Order of the Sword put pressure on Lady's business by taking most of the demons in her area, so she retaliates by hiring Dante to discover why they are collecting demons and Devil Arms in the first place."

About two thousand years ago, Mundus was born and gained great power quickly thanks to the consumption of Qliphoth fruit. He seized the Devil Throne from a prior ruler whose name and rank are not known, and became the ruler of the Demon World.\n\nAn indeterminate amount of time after Mundus installed himself as the ruler of the Demon World, a devil god called Argosax the Chaos rose to power and notability, and began to covet the devil throne, waging a war against Mundus for power. After a great period of war, the Underworld was split in two sides, one ruled by Argosax and the other by Mundus.\n\nSometime after this great war, Mundus threatened the Human World with his power and his army, and planned to fuse the realm with the Demon World. Feeling pity for the humans, Mundus' trusted ally and right-hand man, Sparda, betrayed him and fought for the freedom of humans. Defeating him, he then imprisoned the Prince of Darkness in a sealed vault\n\nAfter Mundus' sealing, Argosax took control of the other half of the Demon World, sudbduing all the other demons present and installing himself as the king of all devils. A few hundred years ago however, his rule was then abruptly interrupted by, Sparda who helped the guardians of Vie de Marli defeat and seal the demon away.\n\nSeveral years later, Urizen took control of the Demon World, unsealed the portal between Demon World and Human World, killing many humans in Red Grave City in order to obtain the Qliphoth fruit. Even though he was succeeded in eating it, he has been defeated by Dante. After his remerging with V, Vergil who was Dante's brother has finally return and the two worlds once again seperated. As Urizen became inactive, the throne became vacant again."

          "content": "The Order of the Sword is a religious organization that believes that long ago, Sparda served as the feudal lord in Fortuna and worship him with the objective to eradicate all demons in his name.\n\nThe Order was headed by Sanctus, the holy priest of the Order and Vicar of Sparda who is killed by Dante at the beginning of the game. He was later resurrected through the Ascension Ceremony. After his death at the hands of Nero however, the Order of the Sword became an autonomous group with no real leader. The Knights of the Order were previously lead by the previous Supreme Commander, Credo. Knights all wear uniform clothes and swords, designed by Agnus, the Order's former Chief Alchemist.\n\nThe main headquarters of the Order is an immense fortress on the eastern side of the island, built above the ocean itself.\n\nThe Order has a heavily funded and extensive research division dedicated to the development of their technology. This research division does not only develop anti-demon weapons, like Durandal and Caliburn swords, but also does extensive research into magic, alchemy and demonic sub-species. They use this knowledge to create their own artificial demons, among many other uses.\n\nAs can be expected from the name, the Order's weapon of choice is a sword. The ones the Holy Knights presently use were designed by Agnus, the Order's Chief Alchemist. These anti-demon weapons feature a combustion engine, which, when revved, allow for powerful sword strikes. There are two variations of this design:\n\nCaliburn - Standard weapons of the Order's Knights. They feature a slimmer blade than the officer's Durandal.\nDurandal - Officers' swords. Credo's sword is a Durandal, as is Nero's, although his Red Queen is a heavily modified variant.\n\nDemons created by the Order to support their ranks:\n\nCutlass - A demon made from combining fish and a blade, it can cut through the earth and metal with its powerful fin-blade.\n\nGladius - A reptilian flying demon that can take the shape of a large sword. It is wielded by Agnus as his preferred weapon in combat.\n\nBasilisk - A dog-shaped demon capable of launching its head like a fireball.\nAlto & Bianco Angelos - Artificial demons created by animating a Angelo body armor using demon and human souls. The Bianco Angelos serve as the primary foot soldiers of the Order, whereas the Alto Angelos serve as battle commanders and tactical leaders.\n\nThe Savior - A gigantic, immensely powerful living statue like-demon, created in the image of Sparda by melding together millennia of demonic matter and spirit. It is pivotal to the Order's plans and the key to spreading their propoganda.\n\nOther technology: \n\nAscension Ceremony - A process devised by the Order in order to empower its subjects with demonic abilities. If successful, it grants the participants supernatural powers and a divinely physical appearance, although in reality they only become artificial demons.\n\nHell Gates - By making the smaller copies of the real Hell Gate and powering them with the powerful Devil Arms, The Order was able to open pathways to the Demon World.\n\nIt was stated by Agnus that they use them as an endless supply of demons in order to harness their souls and convert them into Bianco Angelos, their subservient foot soldiers.\n\nChrono Slicers - These are time-manipulating devices requiring the Key of Cronus to function. Most of them are just prototypes and operate only for a limited period of time.\n\nLaser Barriers - These defense mechanisms are composed of rapid-moving lasers, these are encountered in the Headquarters of the Order.\n\nGyro Blade - Large powerful artifacts shaped into top-like structures. They are capable of mobility only with the use of the Anima Mercury.\n\nJump Pads - Pads that allow the user to reach greater heights. They can only be used when the Wing Talisman is nearby."

By 1913 ME, Inkopolis found itself in a inter-species war against the previously neutral species known as Octarians that would become the most brutal, drawn out conflict in history, with millions dead fighting over land being constantly lost to rising sea levels known as the Great Turf War, which involved the useage of ancient human weapons and technologies such as nuclear bombs and walking weapon platforms. After the Great Turf War, Inkopolis and it's allies were considered victorious and conquered all Octarian lands, driving the Octarians underground and purging any remaining Octarian populations that remained. Today, Inkopolis serves as the global hub for all Inklings and many oceanic species."

Inkopolis itself was heavily influenced by the ruins of Tokyo and today serves as a cultural hub for not only Inklings, but those interested in studying ancient human culture.\nLike Tokyo of old, Inkopolis Culture is very urbanist and focuses on life in the city.\nAs a side effect of having a corporate-dominated economy, Corporate Culture has integrated into the mainstream culture, which can be quite mentally draining to those not used to such strong corporate values.\nA notable aspect of Metropolitan Culture is it's love of music; Being evolved from Humanity and their emotions, Inklings and other oceanic life has a constant desire to listen, and express themselves by means of music and all things rhythm.\n\nAll that pales in comparison to the perpetually changing Youth Culture."

Sports that don't involve weapons or physical contact are seen as boring. \nBeing the best and freshest, even through violent means, is seen as a positive quality many are encouraged to embrace.\n\nIn more recent times (With help by the MSDF), Conflict and War are now seen as fun, competitive sports in which one can compete against enemies of the city. The previous traditions of peace and cooperation are being forgotten by the youth, being seen as 'Boring geezer junk'. More and more younger Inklings are voting for more radical political parties such as the 'Fresh Youth Party', which advocates for Metropolitan Nationalism, Annexing of remaining Octarian lands, Mandatory conscription and free weapons to all Inkopolitans."

It is said it's dreams ARE reality itself and if it ever woke up it would be the end of existence itself. It's claimed that all misfortunes are but bad dreams the Sleeping One has. Common practices in R'lyehism include Communal gatherings, Sacrifices, Religious chanting and Dream Rituals. Communal Gatherings: Every end of the month, All R'lyehists in a area gather in an open area to bath in the light of the Moon to celebrate the Sleeping One's continued sleep. Here, Festivals and Holidays are usually celebrated for R'lyehists. Sacrifices: A core component of R'lyehism is a emphasis on sacrifices to ensure the Sleeping One keeps having good dreams and that it doesn't ever wake up. During earlier times, these sacrifices usually involved taking the life of an 'Blessed' Inkling and burning their blue blood in an fire. Nowadays, Worshippers will often sacrifice money, food or amounts of blood to burn in an communal temple to continue the sleeping one's sleep. Chanting: Worshippers are required to chant messages of good rest and calm waters to the sleeping one in the hopes it will dream of good things in one's favor. These chants are often done by 'High Old Ones' in a language claimed to be the tongue of the Sleeping One itself, although doing these chants in normal Calamarish is said to work too. Dream Rituals: A very important part of R'lyehism is the belief that dreaming can affect how the Sleeping One dreams. Worshippers often practice chants for good night's rest and take herbal medications that induce drowsiness and feelings of calmness to ensure good dreams for both them and the Sleeping One. The most devoted of worshippers often will sleep for days at a time."

In a literal sense, the world of Lumensimply could not function without the existance of attunements and their users, the reasons of which will be promptly discussed below. Prior to the existence of Attunements, the world can be imagined to be similar to the real life. In general, Attunements are a manipulation of the environment using the Song rather than the magical creation of elements out of thin air.\n\nWhile in-game, the player uses attunements mainly for combat purposes, but the extent and potential of attunements were also displayed subtly in other ways and is demonstrated in the form of talent cards. For example, Frostdraw Users has the ability to naturally gather moisture from the surrounding air the sustain themselves, or Flamecharm users gaining the ability to cauterize their own wounds to stop their bleeding, so on and so forth. While the player uses their Attunement to an adequate degree, the demonstrated uses pale in comparison to the daily-uses of Attunements in the world of Deepwoken.\n\nThe Four Attunements of the Canticlysm\n\nThe Four Basic Attunements, Flamecharm, Frostdraw, Galebreathe and Thundercall were discovered and developed during the Canticlysm; the peak of understanding The Song, and also the eventual downfall of the Old World.\nThe 4 Attunements were discovered and developed during the Canticlysm.\n\n\n"

Flamecharmers from the Western Luminant are known for their mastery of this Attunement.\nIt was invented when Pleeksty consumed a chunk of Korilfiend's flesh (Drowned god), allowing him to speak to and thus 'charm' fire.\n(Pleeksty) Pleeksty is a major figure to Flamecharmers, with multiple alents with his name in them, and he is mentioned by Plume in Etris.\nPleeksty was a Black Diver who is Missing in Action during his deep dives in The Depths. He is the only person to ever be confirmed to have traversed the third layer of the Depths.\nFlamecharm does not create fire; instead, creates combustion.\n(Flameworshipper Shield) The description of the Flameworshipper Shield tells a small, yet brief history of Flamecharmers; focused primarily on those who worship the element of fire.\nWorshippers of Fire is seen as individuals embracing dichotomy between Fire and the Sea. Fire representing Mankind, while the Deep represents as an ultimate threat of the New World.\n(Flameworshipper Shield) Other than the history lesson given by the Flameworshipper Shield, the Shield itself bears the emblem of a Flamepriest.\n(Flame Worshipper Armor) This armor is a standard-issue armor of the Covenant of Flame.\nThe Covenant are active worshippers of Pleeksty, though he doesn't interact with them, seeing them as a crazy fan club.[1]\n(Lumen's Folklore: Volume 'Attunement') One of the most common valuable attunements. Can be used in smithery and cooking. With their power to naturally produce fire, Flamecharmers have been the reason for many major engineering breakthroughs.\n\n\nThe First Light is a Heavy Weapon obtained as a rare drop from slaying a Crimson Megalodaunt, or by finding it inside a Merchant Ship. It has unique animations and a unique critical.\n\nBlade of Venn Kaelhand, a disciple of Pleeksty, who immersed themself much too deeply in the study of beasts altered by Korlfiend's influence. Met their fate in the jaws of a unique specimen of Megalodaunt said to have been exposed to the vents of Korilfiend.\n\nCompared to other greatswords, this one looks more modern as the design resembles a more modern-designed blade and handle with designs and patterns of edges and gold crafted into it, rather than a basic flat blade with some carvings scratched into it\n\nDespite being considered a legendary weapon, it doesn't scale with flamecharm and can be enchanted. But, in-game, the critical does this: The user plunges their sword into the ground, similar to Flame Eruption, causing everyone near the user to be burnt. This is followed up with flaming swords raining from the sky, similar to the Crimson Megalodaunt's Pyroclastic Roar. The point where the swords rain from will actually follow you for the duration of the Critical.\n\n"

Simply put, these will be the magic abilities that you use in combat to fend off your adversaries or assist yourself in achieving specific goals.\n\nMantras are a key aspect of combat, and it is incredibly important to master the usage of mantras while fighting to get the edge over your opponent. You can't get very far with just a weapon and skill alone; mantras can turn the tide of a battle easily and is what makes Deepwoken's combat very deep and engaging, with various mechanics to accompany them.\n\nA player's mantras are tied to their character's stats - the higher a given stat, the more likely you are to obtain a corresponding mantra. Similarly, to weapons and armor, mantras can also have 1-3 stars which correlate with their rarity and strength. Mantras with higher stars have higher stat requirements.\n\nFlamecharm Mantras\nLarge and threatening fire-based spells. Excels in crowd control and area denial as many spells have large range.\nLava serpent is a path that one takes with the Flamecharm attunement. It removes their ability to burn but instead replaces it with eruptions under the target\nCan be further upgraded with Azure Flame for even more damage.\n\nThundercall Mantras\nLightning utilizes fast and quickly regenerating spells to take a fight at any desired pace. Has spells with somewhat small start-up for closing distance or keeping an opponent on edge.\n\nLightning has a wide variety of useful spells for fighting monsters and exploring the world.\nTypically used mid/long range.\nSurge path can be obtained at 40 thundercall. Adding stacks of surge to an enemy which deal somewhat heavy damage with the removal of its stun.\nGreat pressure.\nA lot of fight control and escape mantras.\nMost thundercall mantras work with blast spark.\nHighest Base Damage, Lowest Scaling.\nFrostdraw Mantras\nUses ice to freeze enemies and create physical obstructions, allowing the user to both navigate the world easier and create terrain in combat.\n\nCan slow opponents, temporarily freeze them, or make barriers forcing opponents to go around.\nCrystallization can be unlocked at 40 frostdraw, dealing extra damage with the removal of chill. Comes with a whole new variety of Mantras.\nTypically used close/mid-range.\nHas a very good mobility mantra \"Ice Skate\"\nHas small cooldowns.\n\nGalebreathe Mantras\nWind utilizes the best all-rounder kit amongst the elements for movement, defense, and offensive actions.\n\nIt has a mix of close-range combo spells and long ranged options, along with multiple movement talents for moving around the world.\nSpecter can be unlocked at 40 Galebreathe, dealing extra damage and having more mobility at the cost of being unable to get suffocation, comes with the \"Specter Bar\".\nUsually agreed on as the most \"versatile\" attunement.\nFocuses mainly on movement.\nTypically used in any range.\nApplies suffocate, negating mantras of the opponent. Happens when using wind gun, gale trap or using world without song.\nShadowcast Mantras\nUses dark energy to siphon Ether from others into the user's own Ether.\n\nExcels in keep the opponent locked down and under pressure.\nHas its niche in keeping the Ether bar up and making sure others can't use Ether.\nGoes well when paired with other elements.\nApplies obscured, obscuring the vision of the opponent.\nTypically used mid-range.\nIronsing Mantras\nIronsing provides the widest ranged mantras in the game and the best damage output based on your opponent's mistakes and missteps.\n\nOffers mantras that favor the user, benefits both short and long distance.\nScrapsinger can be obtained at 40 ironsing. Instead of metal rods pulling enemies towards you when pressing the x key, instead it increases the amount of armor damage opponents take.\nTunes in well with the metal enchantment, as the metal path gives you benefits depending on how much armor your opponent has.\nApplies metal rods, which can be used in different ways by the user who applied it, enabling different strategies and forms of combat."

Your ultra rich parents helped you learn Japanese. They paid tons of bribes to a lot of officials to get you Japanese citizenship. They even bought you a house in Japan so that you could move there. But your parents chose to stay in America. Now you live alone in your apartment and are a student at a mixed Japanese high school. There are a lot of sexy women in your neighborhood and in your apartment, but most of them are married. There are a lot of sexy girls at your school, but most of them have boyfriends. But you can't let a few boyfriends and a few husbands stop you from getting what you want. You have something that these Japanese guys with tiny cocks don't have. You have a huge cock! Using your huge cock, you can break the minds of any girl and any woman you want and make them dependent on it. But be careful, because their partners won't like you trying to steal them. That's why you should know that if you get caught up by jealous boyfriends and husbands, there can be severe consequences. You still have the option to have sexual and romantic relationships only with single women and girls who don't have boyfriends. Or you could try to take every woman and girl you see for yourself. Build yourself a harem or choose one of your love interests. The choice is yours!"

Servants are Spirits made into special Familiars of the highest rank, referred to as Ghost Liners by the Mage's Association, that are bound to the Master. Typically Heroic Spirits under most systems, they can also sometimes be Divine Spirits, Phantoms, Wraiths, and living people depending on various circumstances. Pure Heroic Spirits, the \"main body\" in the Throne of Heroes, can only be summoned by the World, and summoning even one is considered to be a miraculous occurrence. Differing from the normal definition of Familiars that can be likened to minor mascots unable to be stronger than their masters, Heroic Spirits are the most powerful of beings with which even the five Magicians would never be able to forge a contract with. Rather than it being a hard process to summon them or the fact that they far surpass Magi, it is their intrinsic nature in that they are beings beyond Magecraft.\n\nMaster: Master is a designation given to an individual, usually a Magus, who has become one of the formal participants of the Holy Grail War by obtaining Command Spells and forming a contract with a Servant. Under ordinary circumstances, a Master is always a spellcaster, usually a Magus with a Magic Circuit, who is selected by the Holy Grail. It is possible for an ordinary person to become a Master, though this is rare."

          "content": "The Command Spells or Command Seals, are three claims of absolute obedience, the crystallization of a great magic, that a Master has over a Servant in the Holy Grail War system. They can also be used to make a servant do something that cant be done normally, like teleporting herself to the side of her master, or to stand up and keep fighting when they body has already been broken, etc.\n\nUnable to normally be controlled by humans, they are burdened by the \"absolute condition for materialization\", the authority of the Command Spell carved into them at the moment of summoning. They are holy marks signifying a Magi's status as a Master, a system that was created by Zouken Makiri after the failure of the First Holy Grail War.\n\n\nObtaining Command Spells: The Fuyuki Holy Grail for example, grants a total of twenty-one Command Spells in each war. Masters obtain three Command Spells, and Servants have no choice but to cooperate with their Masters due to their hold over them. Depending on the nature of the Servant, such binding is not necessary, while others may slay their Master instantly should all three be lost. They disappear as they are used up, and it can be said that a Master who uses up all three loses authority over their Servant. Even if a Master contracts with multiple Servants at once, they will only be given a total of three Command Spells that can be used on any contracted Servant.It is possible to steal more from other Masters or receive more from the overseer depending on circumstances, and it is also possible that anyone interfering with the activities of the Church will have their Command Spells decreased. Their loss does not indicate forfeiture of position in the Holy Grail War, as the contract with the Servant is also part of being a Master.\nCommand Spells do not disappear simply with the loss of a Servant, but instead only when one gives up or loses their right to be a Master. With regular Masters, this happens instantly upon losing their Servant, and only members of the Three Founding Families have shown the ability to exercise the authority of a Master even without a Servant. They will not lose their Command Spells so long as there exist Servants without established contracts.\nLost Command Spells are reclaimed by the Holy Grail during the Holy Grail War and can be redistributed to new contractors who take on a Servant who has lost their Master. While searching for new Masters, it will prioritize those who had been previously chosen. The Church provides protection to Masters without Servants for the reason of them having greater chance of obtaining leftover Command Spells. Masters aim to kill other Masters rather than simply cut off their combat effectiveness so that they will not be able to take up another contract in the future. Of the Command Spells that are left after the Holy Grail War, they are amassed in the hands of the supervisor and commissioned for safekeeping. It is possible to keep a contract after the Holy Grail War has ended, as the only issue is the added strain on the Magus after the support from the Holy Grail in the upkeep of the Servant stops.\n\nCharacteristics: Command Spells appear on those selected by the Holy Grail, some of which have been shown to manifest three years before the event. It is normal that the Holy Grail decides on those it deems worthy and have a reason to seek it. The spell manifests in Form of a seal on the body part of the master.  The seals typically appear somewhere on the arm, looking like tattoos at first sight. Upon receiving or losing Command Spells, there is often a slight pain. If the Master or Servant are in critical danger, it may throb to warn them."

All Lightners depicted so far live in Hometown.\n\nUnlike in Undertale, Lightners of both kinds possess the universal qualities of a SOUL, and according to Queen, the power of determination and the ability to create Dark Fountains.\n\nAccording to stories told by Darkners such as King and Seam, the Lightners were once the protectors of the Darkners, before they left them alone in the shadows. Seam explains that Lightners were seen as the \"Gods\", \"protectors\", \"creators\" and \"those who gave [Darkners] purpose\". One day however, the Darkners were locked away in the Dark World, and the Lightners were never seen by them again. During the final battle with King, King rants about how the Lightners abandoned him and his kingdom, and how he hates them all. King then goes on to say that the Knight has provided the purpose that the Lightners took from the Darkners, and that with the Knight, King will take revenge on the Lightners that abandoned him.\n\nHowever, Kris, a human Lightner, cannot cast magic. Despite the fact Kris can get magic from certain items, they cannot manifest it into a spell like the others. However, they can ACT instead."

          "content": "Darkners are beings that inhabit the Dark Worlds, as opposed to the Lightners that exist in the Light World. They are the keepers of the Dark Fountains.\n\nA Darkner's appearance is typically themed off of an inanimate object in Light World. For example, Chapter 1's Darkners resemble playing cards, board pieces, and toys from the Unused Classroom. In contrast, Chapter 2's Darkners are electronics, software components, and computer programs. They reflect the Computer Lab in the Library.\n\nDarkners also are capable of using magic. Their attacks correspond with their object and their original Dark World. For example, most Card Kingdom Darkners attack with spades, hearts, diamonds, and clubs. Cyber World Darkners use attacks related to pop-up boxes, electricity, lasers, etc.\n\nDarkners can be transferred to other Dark Worlds if Kris transports their Light World counterpart. They can also be recruited if they are spared, or other merciful means outside of encounters. However, if a Darkner stays in a different Dark World, they eventually turn to stone. The only Dark World that all Darkners can reside in without turning to stone is Castle Town, because its fountain is made from \"pure darkness.\" Ralsei is the only Darkner exempt from these effects. He does not turn to stone and traverses to other Dark Worlds seemingly by himself.\n\nSome Darkners also have knowledge that does not pertain to Dark World. Darkners can be aware of where a Dark World takes place within Hometown.[1] They can also recall their Hometown counterpart's interactions with Lightners.[2] Additionally, Darkners can offer advice on game controls,[3] gameplay,[4] and SAVING.[5] However, their knowledge can be limited. An example of this is Jigsaw Joe being unfamiliar with the Warp Door he can aid in repairing.\n\nAccording to the Prophecy, Darkners and Lightners once lived in harmony. The Earth would be doomed to a destruction known as The Roaring if the balance of Light and Dark were to be disrupted, a phenomenon caused by an excess of Dark Fountains.\n\nThis doom can only be averted by the Delta Warriors, who will restore the balance of Light and Dark by sealing the Fountains and casting away \"the Angel's Heaven\". In the abandoned Castle Town surrounding the original Dark Fountain, the lonely Ralsei awaited the Prophecy's other two heroes, hoping to avert the destruction of the world.\n\nThe people of the Card Kingdom remember living in harmony with the Lightners, but they now believe that the Lightners abandoned them and trapped them in a sealed realm without a purpose. Recently, a strange Knight appeared and led one of the kingdom's four Kings to rebel, annexing the realms of the three other Kings and forcing their citizens to serve him and obey his son, Lancer. Around the same time, a new Dark Fountain emerged near his Card Castle, disrupting the balance of Light and Dark, and the court jester, influenced by \"a strange someone\" to believe that the world was only a game, was imprisoned on orders of the four Kings by the court magician, who then left the castle too.\n\nEnraged and heartbroken by the Lightners' abandonment, King came to believe that the emergence of \"holy\" Dark Fountains to further disrupt the Balance would cast the world into eternal darkness instead of destroying it, allowing Darkners to take rulership and inflict suffering on Lightners. Many of his former staff, fired during his rages, were imprisoned or forced to find work elsewhere in his Dark World.\n\nChapter 1\nWith the appearance of the prophesied heroes, Ralsei leaves Castle Town to accompany them to the second Dark Fountain. Along the way, they meet King's son, who had been ordered to stop them and who orders groups of Darkner fighters to oppose them. Despite initial friction, the party eventually reaches Card Castle and confronts King, with the battle's aftermath depending on how they treated their enemies along the way. The Lightner heroes proceed to the second Dark Fountain, where they return to their own world.\n\nChapter 2\nThe Darkners of the Cyber World are largely on good terms with Lightners, unlike those from the Card Kingdom. The only possible exception is Queen, the eccentric monarch of the Dark World, led astray by the Knight's power; convinced that creating more Dark Fountains and thus Dark Worlds creates further prosperity for her subjects, not knowing the true consequences of disrupting the balance between light and dark.\n\nIn order to accomplish her mission, she plans to capture Lightners (notably Noelle Holiday), knowing that Lightners with strong determination can create Dark Fountains, much as the Knight could. She changes her mind about her plan quite quickly after learning the true nature of The Roaring from Ralsei."

          "content": "Kris is a human Lightner and the main protagonist of Deltarune. They are presumably the human Hero of Light in the Prophecy. In a Dark World, they function as the party's leader.\n\nKris is controlled by the player for the majority of the game. The few exceptions are brief cutscenes, or when they tear the SOUL out of their body.\n\nKris excels at ACTing in battles, and wields a sword that can transform into a shield when DEFENDing.\n\nAlso known as\nHoney (Toriel)\nBlue person (Lancer)\nKRISP (Temmie)\nKrissy (Bratty, Catty, Onion)\nHyper-Potato-Mouse (Onion)\nCrisper (Onion)\nLittle buddy (Burgerpants)\nKrismas (Rudy, Noelle, Onion)\nLittle Sponge (Spamton)\nKid (Sans, Spamton, Undyne, Tutorial Masters)\nBoss (Recruited Darkners)\nFirst Appearance\nHometown\nRelationships\nAsgore Dreemurr (adoptive father)\nToriel (adoptive mother)\nAsriel (adoptive brother)\nRalsei (friend; teammate)\nSusie (friend; classmate; teammate; former enemy)\nLancer (friend; teammate; former enemy)\nNoelle Holiday (friend; classmate; former teammate; neighbor)\nBerdly (ally; classmate; former enemy)\nAlphys (teacher)\n\nKris is a teenage human with an amber skin tone and messy, shoulder-length dark maroon hair. They wear a long-sleeve lime shirt with one horizontal yellow stripe, and nondescript pants and shoes. One of Kris's distinct traits is that their long bangs cast a shadow that hides the upper half of their face. In the brief moments they tear the SOUL out of their body, their red eyes can glow in the dark. One of their crimson eyes is also visible for a few frames when they descend into a Dark World.\n\nIn a Dark World, Kris's entire appearance transforms, making them resemble a knight. Kris dons silver armor: shoulder pauldrons, a cuirass, gauntlets, and boots. They wear a navy blue bodysuit underneath the set, and a pink cape drapes across their right shoulder. Finally, Kris's skin changes to cyan, and their hair transits to navy. The shading for their skin is also used for their cape, giving the illusion of blue stripes in a few of their sprites.\n\nTo the player, Kris consistently has a blank, neutral expression. They seemingly stand straight during the majority of non-scripted actions. Kris's expressions and movement are different when they are about to remove or have removed the SOUL.\n\nPersonality\nDuring the events of Deltarune, Kris is mentioned to be an introvert. Susie and King refer to Kris as a \"quiet person,\" and Noelle is astonished if they converse about \"anything.\" After Kris's brother, Asriel, left for college, they became distant from their few friends. Kris's side of their shared bedroom is also strikingly bare. The shared game console is underneath Asriel's bed, and their old children's books are in Toriel 's classroom instead. Toriel has also mentioned that Kris is not normally energetic. They have a history of not waking up on time, and often slept through the start of class. Kris also preferred their mother driving them to and from school than walking.\n\nContrary to Kris's apparent detachment, they do have a variety of interests. Kris has always been mischievous, pulling dark pranks such as covering themselves in ketchup and claiming it was blood. For example, Kris has the option to keep flushing the toilet before or after going to school, with Toriel replying: \"You did not put a bath bomb in the toilet again, did you?\"\n\nKris enjoys playing the piano. Prior to the game, they frequently played the hospital piano, despite it \"missing most of the good keys.\" They have searched for tutorials to improve,[8] and Red Big Mouth believes they can play the hospital piano \"beautifully.\" In a private post from Noelle's blog, Noelle mentions that Kris would often come to her house and use her piano since Kris did not have one in their home. Noelle explains that whenever she followed them into the dining room to listen to them play, Kris would immediately stop playing. Without an interruption from Noelle, however, Kris would continue playing, sometimes for hours at a time.\n\nWhen younger, Kris studied the occult with Catti. They appear to still have an interest in this topic, as one of their search queries was \"how to use magic.\"\n\nAt the end of Chapter 1, Red Big Mouth and Toriel both comment on Kris's physical appearance. They cite that Kris seems \"a little sick\" and does \"not look quite yourself\" respectively. It is implied that the SOUL is the reason, though the exact cause is unknown. Notably, Kris wants to be perceived as \"normal\" despite Toriel's concern.\n\nKris is shown to have a significant amount of agency outside of the player's choices. This is most clearly shown in scenes where Kris rips the SOUL out of their body, but also in how characters react to Kris's dialogue choices: occasionally, the player may choose an option that other characters note sounds like Kris is straining to say. Kris is also shown performing actions independently of the player's control, including protecting Susie from King or awkwardly trying to escape the Sweet Cap'n Cakes fight with Ralsei and Susie, showing their friendship with the two exists outside of the player's influence. Additionally, there are some instances in Chapter 2 where Kris stops inspecting something relating to their home life, preventing the player from learning more: when inspecting Asriel's room in Queen's Mansion, Kris closes their eyes before peeking into Asriel's room in the Guest Hall; when inspecting an article about Asgore's firing and Undyne's promotion, Kris intentionally stops reading before the reason is given. The separation between the player and Kris is most clearly shown in the Snowgrave Route, where it is heavily implied Kris's actions are being done against their will. Noelle describes the voice she heard giving her orders as terrifying, noting Kris has been acting very strange lately. When Kris reunites with the party after defeating Berdly, Susie and Ralsei immediately notice Kris appears distraught.\n\nAnother instance of this happens in the normal route of Chapter 2, where after defeating Spamton NEO, Susie notices Kris appearing to be in shock. If the player responds to Susie that they're okay by saying Yes, Kris appears strained in their response, making Susie think that they're not okay; if the player responds to Susie by saying No, Kris yells out the response, concerning Susie and Ralsei. This heavily implies that Spamton's dialogue during his boss fight about being a puppet and cutting his strings to be free, combined with his ultimate fate, deeply unsettled Kris.\n\nYears ago, Kris was adopted by the Dreemurrs and grew up in a loving family. However, as the only human child in Hometown, Kris often felt like an outsider. Kris once asked their adoptive parents when their \"horns were going to grow in.\" In response, Toriel and Asgore bought a headband with red horns for Kris, who wore it for months.\n\nGrowing up, Kris became very close with their older brother, Asriel. The two often explored the forests around town with their neighbors, Dess and Noelle. While the four were close friends, Kris and Noelle grew apart over the years. The cause for this is unknown. Kris had also wanted to befriend Bratty, as she was one of the \"big kids.\" They willingly complied and retrieved food for her until she became sick.\n\nAt some point, Toriel and Asgore became divorced. While their family was broken, Kris and Asriel remained inseparable. On occasion, Asriel would buy Kris a hot chocolate at QC's Diner, something they used to do together as a whole family. One day, Asriel had to go away to college, leaving Kris alone and without many friends\n\n\n\n\n\nKris has several different titles.\n\nAt the start of Chapter 1, Kris is a Human. \"Body contains a human SOUL.\"\nAfter meeting Ralsei, they become a Leader. \"Commands the party with various ACTs.\"\nIf Kris inspects every bed in Card Castle, they become a Bed Inspector. \"Inspects all beds inexplicably.\"\nAfter fighting Sweet Cap'n Cakes in Chapter 2, they become a Tactician. \"Commands the party by ACTs. Sometimes.\"\nWhen inspecting the Moss in Chapter 2, they become a Moss Finder. \"Basic moss-finding abilities.\"\nIf on the Snowgrave Route in Chapter 2, they become a Leader. \"Commands.\"\n\nRelationships\nAsriel\nAsriel has been consistently kind to his younger sibling. He has used the knockoff controller to play video games, begged for forgiveness for Kris's \"sins,\" and had carried Kris to school. The duo are very close since childhood, and various Hometown residents acknowledge this. After Asriel left for college, Kris often stayed up late conversing with him online, until the internet went out. Despite this, Kris deeply misses Asriel.\n\nToriel\nYears prior to Deltarune, it is implied Toriel had difficulties raising Kris. She had frequently borrowed \"How To Care For A Human,\" from the Library's second floor. Despite this, Toriel is patient and motherly, and finds most of Kris's antics endearing. She still holds Kris's hand when taking them to school, and keeps their childhood drawing in her classroom. Although she loves Kris equally to Asriel, she tries to limit Kris's impulsiveness, such as locking the chocolate kisses in her room.\n\nSusie\nIn Chapter 1, Kris is initially intimidated by Susie's rough demeanor. After Susie warns Kris and they escape the spade storm together, Kris is no longer terrified of her. They observe Susie's friendliness towards Lancer, and she tries to recruit Kris for their \"DARK\" team. However, after Susie promises not to hurt Lancer's dad, she decides to listen to Kris's commands. After the battle against King, Kris shields her from a spade attack, only to get knocked down by the King. Now seeing Kris as her friend, Susie stops King from killing them. Upon returning to school, she asks Kris if they can return to the Dark World with a friendly smile. When Toriel calls Kris afterwards, Kris tells her that they were hanging out with a friend, indicating that Kris had a good time with Susie. Notably, Monster Kid's ridicule of Susie offends Kris after their adventure.\n\nDuring Chapter 2, more evidence of their friendship is shown through Kris's actions. They focus on Susie when they drink her Tea, and is distinctly compliant to Susie. If Kris inspects the \"Susie-like Statue\" and \"ICE-E statue,\" Susie wants the former, and insists Kris gets the latter for their room. Kris steals either or both without a prompt, even if the latter statue discomforts them.\n\nRalsei\nKris and Ralsei work together throughout Deltarune, including several times the two are separated from the rest of the party. Ralsei likes Kris very much and sees them as a friend. However, it's implied that Kris doesn't consider Ralsei as close as Susie, as his Tea only heals 60HP (although Noelle's, who is a childhood friend, only heals 10HP more) to them.\n\nNoelle\nKris and Noelle are childhood friends. They spent a lot of time together when they were children, and used to hang out together with their respective older siblings, Asriel and Dess. Kris used to prank and scare Noelle a lot, but she in turn was mostly nice to them. In Chapter 1, Noelle implies that she usually helps Kris with their homework, and gives one of her pencils to them if they lost their own.\n\nIn Chapter 2, Kris and Noelle make a truce and work together through Cyber City. Noelle learns to be more brave and loses her fear of mice. Noelle then opens up to Kris and remembers the time they spent together as kids, and even says that it's unfair how Kris is the only person who knows how weird she is, because everyone knows how weird Kris is.\n\nIn the Snowgrave Route, Kris's relationship with Noelle is severely strained by the player's \"creepy\" demands in the Dark World. Despite being reassured that it is a dream, Noelle is still suspicious of Kris and becomes genuinely terrified when they meet in the Hospital.\n\nBerdly\nKris and Berdly have a rivalry with each other, but they are implied to have played video games (especially fighter games, by Berdly's mentions of wavedashing) together in the past. They become allies through the later parts of Chapter 2 and work together to defeat Queen, with Berdly saving Kris, Susie, and Ralsei before the GIGA Queen fight. Although Berdly believes the adventure in the Dark World to all be a dream, he gives studying with Kris and Susie a chance and even nicely wishes them both a good day before leaving the Library.\n\nDess\nAs children, Kris and Asriel used to spend time with Noelle and Dess. It is implied that they were friends, though she did not tolerate some of Kris's mischief. Dess once smacked Kris with a wiffle bat until they stopped lying to Noelle that \"ICE-E was real and eats kids.\"\n\nRudy\nRudolph Holiday is a friend of Kris's father, Asgore. He affectionately sees Kris as \"the creepy kid next door\" he once yelled at for getting tangled in the Holidays' light display. Rudy treats Kris kindly regardless, and jests if they inspect other objects in the room. In Chapter 1, Rudy is surprised to see Kris visit him, and assumes Toriel urged them.\n\nWhen saving the game for the first time, the SAVE file being replaced is named \"Kris,\" implying Kris has saved prior to the game beginning.\nIf a SAVE slot is erased, [EMPTY] replaces Kris's name instead when starting a new game in that slot.\nKris is the only party member to not have a hurt sprite battle portrait when they receive damage.\nWhen Susie thinks about what Kris would do during the Ferris wheel scene in Chapter 2, one of the options is \"Point and hearts come out,\" referring to Kris's ACT animation.\n\nAn ICE-E sightings report from a young Noelle, who screamed when she thought she saw the ICE-E on a pizza box wink at her. Dess burned out the eyes on the box, and Asriel suggested they bury the box. As Kris was about to bury it in the cemetery, Noelle fussed over potential zombies. They wore the box over their head and scared Noelle, and Dess hit Kris before throwing the box instead in response.\nTwo from Noelle's blog:\n\nA private post from Noelle, reminiscing about how Kris used visit and play with her. They would suddenly stop and play the piano instead. If she watched, they would stop playing.\nThe URL for this post seems to imply that Kris inherited the Dreemurr's last name, making their full name Kris Dreemurr.\n\nA private post written by Noelle. She mentions how Susie had been actively bullying Kris, though she notes that Kris seems \"oblivious\" to this and that they do not inform Toriel. It describes an incident after school where Kris was asleep at their desk, and Susie started to bully them for using apple-scented shampoo. When she threatened them as she bit an apple, Kris suppressed a laugh. With their \"gamer reaction speed\" they deflected, caught, and bit into the apple she threw. Susie immediately grabbed them by the hair and commented how she believed Toriel would soon be tired of them and be happier if they were to disappear. Noelle notes that Kris had quietly responded back, and Susie abruptly left. Afterwards, Kris finds Noelle in her locker, only to slowly close the door and leave."

          "content": "Noelle Holiday is a Lightner from Hometown. Noelle is one of Kris's classmates, as well as their neighbor and childhood friend.\n\nShe plays a minor role in Chapter 1, but becomes a major character in Chapter 2, where she temporarily joins the party during Cyber City.\n\nNoelle lives on the northwest side of Hometown with her mother, the Mayor, and her father, Rudy, who is currently in the hospital with an unnamed illness.\n\nAlso known as\nAngel (Addison and Spamton)\nHochi Mama (Spamton)\nholidaygirl1225 (Spamton Sweepstakes)\nFirst Appearance\nHometown\nRelationships\nRudolph Holiday (father)\nMayor (mother)\nDess Holiday (older sister; unknown)\nSusie (friend; ally; classmate; love interest)\nBerdly (friend; ally; academic partner; classmate)\nKris (childhood friend; ally; classmate; neighbor)\nAsriel (childhood friend)\nQueen (friend; ally; former enemy)\n\nAppearance\nNoelle is a reindeer-like monster with short brown fur, a red nose, freckled cheeks, and prominent front teeth, as well as a pair of small antlers atop her head. She walks upright, and has long golden blonde hair. She wears a red and green checkered sweater with dark grey sleeves and a dark grey skirt.\n\nIn the Dark World, her hair becomes pale blonde and her fur obtains a pinkish tone. She also wears a long white dress/robe with a hood and ample sleeves but her smile turns into a straight face/frown.\n\nPersonality\nNoelle is friendly and cheerful, but also very timid, and sometimes has trouble saying what she's thinking. She apologizes often, and stays quiet about her feelings, such as her possible crushes, or her distaste for Berdly, out of fear. Her father says that \"everything scares her,\" and describes her as \"defenseless.\" According to him, she has a fear of humans hiding under her bed. This was made worse (or started) by Kris's repeated attempts to scare her when they were younger, including at least one time they hid under her bed. She shows to be more honest to Kris when it comes to her feelings and often yells at them when they pull pranks on her. She becomes more brave and less fearful from Chapter 2, during the time she spends with Kris in the city. Noelle apparently has tendencies of masochism, particularly fantasizing about Susie bullying her for various things (e.g. Susie pushing her over and laughing at Noelle for asking Susie to ride with her on the Ferris Wheel).[1]\n\nHowever, Noelle does have brash moments that push aside her shy behavior. An example of this was when Berdly admits that he may have feelings for Susie, which causes Noelle to angrily shake him since she has a crush on Susie as well.\n\nMain Story\nHistory\nNoelle grew up in Hometown with a loving father and a strict mother, and was very close with her older sister, Dess. As a child, Noelle and her sister became friends with her neighbors Kris and Asriel Dreemurr, and the four of them would often explore the forest around the graveyard together. One day, however, an unspecified tragedy occurred, and it is implied that Dess either died or went missing.\n\nAt some point, likely when she was quite young, Noelle nearly won a spelling bee, but froze up and couldn't speak when spelling the word \"December\", which handed the victory to Berdly. While unclear, it is implied that the word \"December\" is related to Noelle's sister Dess, likely being her full name.\n\nChapter 1\nWhen Kris enters the classroom at school, Noelle offers to let them join her class project group with Berdly. She attempts to ask Alphys for permission but is interrupted by Berdly, who speaks for her by saying that she and Berdly are \"FINE being alone,\" and also by Susie's abrupt entrance into class. Later, when Alphys realizes that she is out of chalk to teach that day, Noelle volunteers herself (and Susie) to get some. This too is unsuccessful, as Kris is sent by Alphys to accompany Susie instead. If Kris talks to her prior to leaving the classroom, Noelle tries to comfort them, saying she doesn't think Susie is so bad.\n\nAfter Kris returns from the Dark World, Noelle can be found visiting her father Rudy in the Hospital. Rudy gives his daughter advice on how to confess her feelings to Susie, but she is skeptical of his methods. As she leaves, she is caught off guard when she notices Kris in the doorway.\n\nIf Kris talks to Noelle after visiting her father in the hospital, they learn that she is locked out of her house, but doesn't want to bother her mother, the mayor of Hometown. At this point, if Kris mentions Susie, Noelle becomes eager to ask questions about her.\n\nIf Kris tells Noelle that Susie is nice, she becomes relieved and excited.\nIf Kris tells her that Susie is terrible, she becomes shocked, and offers to trade class project partners with Kris.\nIf Kris tells her that Susie eats chalk, Noelle asks if Kris knows what color chalk is her favorite, before realizing that giving her a lunchbox full of chalk probably isn't a great gift.\nIf Kris tells her nothing, she says that she helps Kris all the time, but Kris isn't giving her information. She keeps asking questions about Susie, before deciding that it isn't her personal business.\nIf Kris tries to talk about Susie again, Noelle starts to ask something but quickly decides Kris definitely does not know the answer.\nNoelle voices concern for Kris's well-being, but also acts off-put, or even scared by them. She expresses bewilderment at Kris being so talkative, noting they are usually more of the quiet type.\n\nChapter 2\nThe next day, Noelle attempts to volunteer to read in class, only for Berdly to interrupt her and volunteer instead. After class, Noelle startles Kris and Susie by walking up to them just as they are preparing to enter the Dark World to invite them to study at the Library with her and Berdly. Susie awkwardly accepts. If Kris talked to Noelle about Susie in Chapter 1, Noelle nervously gifts Susie a lunchbox of chalk before running off. However, when Kris and Susie arrive at the library, it becomes apparent that Noelle and Berdly have fallen into a new Dark World in the computer lab.\n\nIn the Cyber World, Noelle is captured by Queen, who intends to recruit Noelle to her cause of world domination. At the end of the Cyber Field, Noelle is pitted against the party on a roller coaster, but promptly replaced by the more eager-to-please Berdly. Noelle escapes and attempts to hide from Queen.\n\nLater, Kris finds Noelle in the City, and she joins Kris's party during the area while they help her hide from Queen and Berdly's antics. This culminates in Noelle's recapture by Queen (alongside Kris, Susie, and Berdly), and she is sent to her own room in Queen's Mansion. Susie comes to rescue her, convinces Noelle that she's dreaming, and the two share a Ferris wheel ride that takes them to the roof of the mansion. Once the ride is over, Susie leaves Noelle with Berdly and rejoins Kris and Ralsei. Berdly then proclaims to a bewildered Noelle that he was leading her on and does not actually have a crush on her, instead having a crush on Susie. Noelle, enraged, promptly starts shaking Berdly.\n\nBerdly and Noelle are recaptured by Queen off-screen, who attempts to persuade Noelle to become a new Knight. After the party fights GIGA Queen, Queen threatens Susie in attempt to force Noelle to open a dark fountain, but Noelle stands up to Queen and refuses. Queen responds to this by asking Noelle to choose for herself whether she wants to stay in the Dark World or the Light World. Noelle and Berdly each consider maintaining the Library Dark World before Ralsei reminds them of the Prophecy – in particular, a new portion regarding the Roaring. Hearing this, they decide against making a new fountain, and Queen allows Kris to seal the Cyber World's fountain, after which everybody wakes up in the computer lab. However, Noelle still appears to believe that the Dark World was all a dream.\n\nNoelle again visits her father in the hospital afterward, and can be visited by Kris and Susie.\n\nSnowgrave Route\nOn the Snowgrave Route, Kris, controlled by the player, uses their time with Noelle to help her become \"stronger\" through killing enemies with her Iceshock spell. Noelle is then coaxed into stealing the Freeze Ring from a shopkeeper, causing her to become more ambivalent towards killing enemies, subsequently becoming brainwashed into thinking Kris is making her stronger.\n\nEventually, Kris and Noelle encounter Berdly, whom Noelle initially does not recognize. Berdly, who becomes worried for Noelle's well-being, engages in a battle, and the player forces Noelle to use SnowGrave, a spell she does not know. This causes Berdly to become encased in a massive ice crystal. After this, Noelle leaves the party in a depressed daze, and is not seen again (except for a short interaction she has with Susie off-screen) until she seemingly finishes off Spamton NEO with an ice attack. Kris seals the Dark Fountain alone, and the party wakes up in the computer lab. Berdly does not wake up.\n\nNoelle has different dialogue in the hospital. She is more controlling of the game she plays with Rudy, and suggests using Ice Shock on the Ice Palace boss (in comparison to suggesting Fire shock in the normal route). When she and Kris leave the room, she begins to question whether or not the events that happened earlier were real or not, eventually finding out they were real (especially if Kris is wearing her watch afterwards).\n\nNoelle's title changes depending on the player's actions.\n\nWhen Noelle joins the party, her title is \"Snowcaster\".\nAfter using IceShock, her title changes to \"Frostmancer\".\nIf she is equipped with the Thorn Ring on the Snowgrave Route, her title changes to \"Ice Trancer\".\nIf Kris finds the moss in Cyber City while Noelle is in the party, her title changes to \"Moss Neutral\".\n\nWhen doing a spell, Noelle crouches and proceeds to stand up with her hands up together with white sparkles coming out.\n\nHeal Prayer\nCosts 32% TP. The same spell used by Ralsei, heals 5 HP for every 1 Magic stat she has on the selected party member. \"Heavenly light restores a little HP to one party member. Depends on Magic.\"\n\nDoing this conjures green sparkles on whoever is being healed.\n\nSleep Mist\nCosts 32% TP. Similar to Ralsei's Pacify, but costs more TP and is cast on all enemies. If enemies are tired or sleepy, Noelle can cast this spell to instantly SPARE them. \"A cold mist sweeps through, sparing all TIRED enemies.\"\n\nDoing this conjures swirling clouds on enemies.\n\nIceShock\nCosts 16% TP, 8% TP if Thorn Ring is worn. An attack that does a significant amount of damage. Notably, this attack freezes enemies solid instead of allowing them to flee. After finding Noelle, every enemy encountered in Cyber City must be frozen with this attack to access the Snowgrave Route. \"Deal magical ICE damage to one enemy.\"\n\nAt the end of the Snowgrave Route when Kris (or the player) calls Noelle for help, she presumably shows up after the screen goes dark and casts three IceShock spells on Spamton NEO.\n\nDoing this spell creates blue stylized snowflakes on enemies.\n\nN-Action\nDoes not cost TP. It is a variant of Susie's S-Action where Noelle does Kris's selected act, much like paired ACTs except that Noelle can choose to do it with another enemy.\n\nDoing this makes Noelle point forward with hearts and stars coming out like Kris.\n\nSnowGrave\n...\nFine! You want to see what happens so bad?\nWatch what happens when I cast a spell I don't know!\n\nNoelle, after pressured to use SnowGrave\n\nCosts 200% TP, 100% TP if Thorn Ring is worn. A spell that does an overwhelming damage to all enemies when used, labelled \"Fatal\". Can only be unlocked by fighting Berdly on the Snowgrave Route, and kept by defeating Berdly with IceShock or melee attacks. \"Deals the fatal damage to all of the enemies.\"\n\nWhen used on Berdly, a unique animation is used.\n\nWhen used on normal enemies, a unique death animation is used for enemies killed.\n\nRelationships\nRudy Holiday\nRudy is Noelle's father. Noelle and her father have an incredibly close and loving relationship. The two often play video games together, with one named Dragon Blazers III that Noelle is waiting to complete with him. She regularly visits Rudy in hospital, though he wishes that in return, he could be around to protect her. She seems upset when Rudy asks her not to wait for him to beat Dragon Blazers III in Chapter 1, implying she worries greatly about his health, but is quickly cheered up when he instead requests that she bring it to the hospital. She does so in Chapter 2.\n\nKris\nNoelle and Dess grew up with Kris and Asriel, and the four of them often used to play together. Kris had a reputation for pulling pranks on Noelle, such as hiding under her bed to scare her or putting ketchup on their arms and faking their death to shock her, but was often swiftly reprimanded by Dess. However, after Dess had gone, the two began to grow apart and Noelle started spending more time studying with Berdly. Despite this, she is still on cordial terms with Kris and is one of the only classmates who makes efforts to be considerate.\n\nDuring Chapter 2, Noelle opens up more to Kris when circumstances lead them to travel Cyber City together and, depending on the player's choice, she will once again consider them friends. However, during the Snowgrave Route, Noelle develops an apparent fear of Kris and their pressuring behavior, as upon spotting them in Hometown, she runs away. In dialogue afterward, it is mentioned she knows something is off with Kris, suggesting she's becoming aware of the player's influence over them.\n\nSusie\nNoelle has a crush on Susie that she is nervous about, and thus tries to hide it. She does not talk about it to anyone, except for her father, though her dialogue with Kris still makes hints towards her crush. Susie is oblivious to Noelle's crush. However, in Chapter 2, she in turn starts opening up to Noelle over the course of their adventure in the Dark World – though she insists to Noelle that it was just a dream after they manage to return to the Light World.\n\nWhile Susie has never bullied Noelle outright, Noelle seems to hint at liking to be bullied by her, as she insisted on asking Alphys to switch partners so Kris isn't the one being pushed against lockers. She also blushes when she thinks about what Susie would do if she asked her to ride the Ferris wheel with her. She talks about how Susie would probably push her to the ground and laugh at her, and she soon forgets what they were talking about.\n\nBerdly\nBerdly is Noelle's academic partner. During Chapter 1, Berdly seems to respect her, calling her the \"second smartest student\". Though Noelle doesn't seem to like him much in return, she speaks nicely to him.\n\nWhen they were younger, they both participated in a spelling bee. After Noelle froze up on the last word (\"DECEMBER\") and was unable to speak, Berdly won, and received a reputation of \"being smart\". In reality, Noelle helps him study, and without her, he wouldn't be the \"number one student\".\n\nIn Chapter 2, they both team up with Queen (though Noelle doesn't want to, and Queen is actually running away from Berdly). After revealing his affections towards Susie, Noelle begins shaking Berdly out of shock. Despite this, Noelle doesn't want harm to come to him (although she freezes him on the Snowgrave Route, but it's implied she didn't see what happened after she used SnowGrave), and Berdly is shown to care about Noelle, viewing her as his friend.\n\nMayor Holiday\nMayor Holiday is Noelle's mother. Although Noelle seems to love her mother, she is not as close with Mayor Holiday as she is with Rudy, and she dislikes bothering the Mayor while she is working. Rudy says that Noelle's mother is \"hard on her\", which is likely a factor in this.\n\nDess\nDess is Noelle's older sister. They are implied to have been very close, as Noelle says she used to watch (scary) movies with her and that Dess consoled her when she was scared. They used to hang out together with Asriel and Kris.\n\nAsriel\nAsriel and Noelle seem to be friends and have a good relationship with each other. During a walking sequence with Kris, Noelle states that when they were kids she along with Asriel, Kris, and her older sister Dess explored the forest behind the graveyard and found nothing interesting and that she remembered crying when she got scared and wiping away her tears with Asriel's jacket.\n\nQueen\nQueen and Noelle meet during Chapter 2. Through the entirety of it, Queen treats Noelle like a daughter, calling her things like \"sweetie\", \"honey\" and \"gravy\". Throughout the chapter, Queen had attempted to force Noelle to become her peon, but it is later shown that deep inside, the Queen actually cared very much about her and just wanted to see her happy. At the end of the chapter, she is shown to understand Noelle better and says goodbye to her and the rest of the main characters.\n\nNoelle also wears red and green in the overworld, colors often associated with Christmas.\nNoelle offers Kris a candy-cane pencil and \"one with lights on it,\" both of which are associated with Christmas.\nNoelle can use ice-based abilities against enemies in the Dark World; ice and winter are associated with Christmas.\nNoelle's mother, the Mayor, is described as being cold and hard on Noelle, as well as having the office air conditioned up to full blast.\nNoelle is a member of the Cross Country Team, along with Jockington and (formerly) Asriel.\nNoelle puts a box with a robotic-looking face painted on it on her head to hide her face from Queen in Cyber City. This is a subtle reference to the Queen's threats to roboticize Noelle's face.\nNoelle appears to dislike meat and enjoy eating vegetables, as shown by her reaction to eating Darkburger and Giga Salad, respectively. This could be due to the fact that real-life reindeers are herbivores.\nAfter Noelle obtains the FreezeRing in the Snowgrave Route, several of Noelle's battle animations change (specifically the animations for defending, attacking, being hurt, and entering/winning a battle).\n\nfound from the \"HAVE YOU SEEN HIM??\" banner, is an ICE-E recent sightings article report from a young Noelle. It describes how she was terrified of an ICE-E pizza box, and how Dess burned out the eyes. Asriel suggested that the box should be buried, and Kris had attempted to bury it in the cemetery. When Noelle expressed her fears, they turned around with the box on their face. In response, Dess hit Kris and threw away the box instead.\n\nNoelle has an online blog with \"holidaygirl1225\" as her username. It is dedicated to \"game secrets, glitches, and theories.\"\n\ndeltarune.com/code/comments/: Reveals that she was particularly in good terms with someone with \"sports\" as their username.\ndeltarune.com/catpetterz/: Noelle describes how \"Cat Petterz 2\" is one of her favorite games, and how she enjoyed modifying the game. However, an error message scared Noelle and caused her to punish her pets and discard eggs to avoid the text.\ndeltarune.com/egg/: The post describes an incident where she received a \"SPECIAL\" white egg after waiting, hatching, and discarding multiple eggs. After she chose to treat it as a normal pet, it \"left home due to happiness.\" She notes that she cannot remember the name of the egg.\ndeltarune.com/kris_dreemurr_kris/: A private post of Noelle reminiscing about when Kris used to visit her house to play with her, then would suddenly choose to play the piano. When she noticed they would stop playing when she watched, she chose to wait instead. While she sometimes questioned her friendship with Kris, she still appreciates them playing the piano. Noelle mentioned how it \"felt like a concert\" when she closed her eyes.\ndeltarune.com/bluecircle/: Reveals she frequently checks her spam mail in case she receives fan mail. When she received one that consists of only letters and numbers, she applied it to \"Cat Petterz 2\" as a modifier. It caused a single blue circle to appear, which would occasionally glitch, had atrocious stats, and multiplied too fast as the word \"Congratulations!\" kept repeating. She was forced to delete all of her pets.\ndeltarune.com/the_n3w3st_g1rl_g1rl/: A private post from Noelle on how Susie had bullied Kris, and notes that they do not tell Toriel. In the post, she mentions how she tried waiting for Kris after school since they were still asleep, and had hid in her locker to keep an eye on the two.\ndeltarune.com/icepalace_glaceir/: A post describing an implied softlock she experienced when she played \"Dragon Blazers\" as a child. However, she discovers a unique door in the area. Upon finding it, Noelle nearly screamed, but immediately reconsidered in case her mother heard and would turn off the game. She notes that the door is locked, and has not been able to find the key for it.\n\n"

          "content": "The Snowgrave Route is an alternate story route in Chapter 2. It takes place in the Cyber World, and significantly alters the events of the story and the bosses encountered. Despite Chapter 1's claims to the contrary, the player's choices matter when making decisions in this route.\n\nAlso known as\nWeird Route (internally)\nAlt (internally)\nSide B (internally)\nCommand Route\nPipis Route\nGenocide Route\nType\nPlot Mechanic\n\nMethod\nThe Snowgrave Route begins after Noelle joins the party in Cyber City.\n\nThe first step below is the most difficult part of the route to figure out, since the game gives no hints that this specific step is necessary. Afterward, the player should be able to figure out the rest of the route on their own, since the game immediately alerts the player when the route is abandoned.\n\nOnce Kris gets to Noelle and has her join their party, the player must backtrack beyond the point where the party originally landed after falling off the rollercoaster, ignoring Noelle's protests that they are going the wrong way.\nAlong the way, the player must defeat every enemy by using Noelle's IceShock spell to freeze them. (One easy enemy to miss is the Poppup disguised as a traffic cone to the right of the trash zone.) After the player has finished backtracking, they must turn around and continue forward again, still making Noelle freeze all the enemies along the way.\nFrozen enemies will remain frozen on the overworld even after leaving the area and returning. Each time all the enemies in an area have been frozen (or another important route requirement is completed), a brief ominous blippy sound plays that goes down in pitch.\nDriving off any enemies using melee attacks or sparing them will immediately end the route. (If any route requirement is failed after the route has begun, a brief and bright sound plays that goes up in pitch, enemies will no longer be permanently frozen on the overworld, and the run will permanently remain on the normal route.)\nAfter reaching the room with the large Ferris Wheel poster, the player must interact with the shopkeeper who offers to sell the party shoes near the top-right side of the room, and say \"We're something else\" when prompted. This should cause the shopkeeper to try to sell Noelle a ring. (If it doesn't, the player has not finished freezing all the necessary enemies yet, but they may backtrack and return to the shopkeeper to try again.) The player must answer \"Get it\" to all of the prompts. The player must not continue past the shopkeeper and complete the next puzzle until this is done.\nFrom this point onward, whenever the player is presented with two dialogue choices, one of which is \"Proceed,\" the player must choose \"Proceed.\"\nBefore the player begins the fight with Berdly, the player must have Noelle freeze all enemies available, then backtrack to the Dog Dumpster. (This is at the bottom left of the room with two long car roads, where Kris would normally encounter the Annoying Dog in a car on a normal route. If the dumpster is interacted with before freezing all available enemies, the player will be told how many encounters remain to be frozen.) If the player interacts with the dumpster after freezing all available enemies, they are able to purchase the Thorn Ring and equip it to Noelle. This must be done before the Berdly fight.\nNoelle should have a new spell when the fight starts. The player must order Noelle to cast it before the fight ends. It is impossible to cast if Noelle does not have the Thorn Ring equipped. She will deny knowing the spell, but the player must continue to tell her to use it.\nAfter this point, all route requirements have been met and the run is locked to this route. Returning to the normal route is not possible.\n\nRequirements\nThere are more requirements to maintain this route than in Undertale's Genocide Route.\n\nAll enemies in all 19 encounters prior to Berdly's second battle must be frozen with Noelle's IceShock spell.\nEnemies can be damaged with weapon attacks, but Noelle's IceShock must deal the final blow.\nDefeating an enemy with a weapon attack aborts the route, as unlike in Undertale, enemies normally flee when their HP becomes 0. Sparing an enemy or pacifying one with Noelle's SleepMist also aborts the route.\nSome enemies will appear that do not appear on the normal route. These must be frozen also.\nWhen interacting with the Addison who offers the Freeze Ring, the answers \"We're something else\" and \"Get it\" must be chosen.\nThe first forcefield puzzle must not be completed before the Freeze Ring is acquired.\nAfter acquiring the Freeze Ring, the \"Proceed\" dialogue option must be chosen at every opportunity.\nBerdly must be defeated with SnowGrave, which can only be cast by buying the Thorn Ring and equipping it to Noelle.\nBefore entering Queen's roller coaster ride, Kris must have at least two free slots in their weapon inventory or storage. Otherwise, they will not have enough space to carry both rings, which will abort the route as SnowGrave cannot be cast.\nThree slots are required if the player also wishes to obtain the Bounce Blade.\n\nDifferences\nStory Changes\nMost NPCs and several background and foreground elements disappear. The Addison that offers to sell the party Dating Shoes also offers to sell Noelle a Freeze Ring. When Noelle tries to decline, the NPC calls her an \"Angel\" and tells her she can't get stronger without better equipment. The player pressures Noelle into \"getting\" the Freeze Ring until the screen fades to black, the sound effect for IceShock is heard, and the Freeze Ring is acquired. Afterwards, the Addison is missing, presumably trapped in the ring.[2] Noelle's battle animations change to imply her increased power over ice and decreased fear in battle.\n\nNoelle starts having dark thoughts of hurting Kris, which alarms her, and Kris (prompted by the player) begins physically pressuring her to complete puzzles by freezing them solid with her ice magic. At first, she is afraid, but tries to justify their actions by suggesting that they are just helping her get stronger. She freezes the final puzzle without prompt and starts asking if the party should \"go find some more enemies.\"\n\nSpamton also refers to Noelle as an \"Angel\" and sells her a Thorn Ring which \"might sting,\" which allows her to cast ice spells at half their TP cost but causes her to take significant damage in battle. When the party meets Berdly, Noelle initially asks Kris if they want her to freeze \"another enemy\". Berdly prompts Noelle to recognize him and asks what she is doing, but she insists that she and Kris are \"getting stronger.\" Berdly tries to fight them to save Noelle, ignoring Noelle's warning to run away. The fight ends when the party obtains enough TP to cast SnowGrave, a \"fatal\" attack. Noelle refuses the command to use SnowGrave several times until she finally snaps and uses it to freeze Berdly completely solid. Noelle says she doesn't feel so good and leaves the party, unlocking a faster route to Queen's Mansion through the sewers.\n\nSusie and Ralsei rejoin the party just outside the mansion entrance, and the party finds out that the mansion has been taken over by Spamton, causing several differences. Numerous paths are blocked off by forcefields and locked doors, many cutscenes are skipped, and dialogue is changed. Dozens of Pipis have been laid out as traps throughout the Mansion: the room with 48 platters is now a maze of Pipis that cause a battle if Kris makes contact with one, the following room requires the player to avoid exploding Pipis with their SOUL, and the hallway leading up to the shortcut replaces the pottery with Pipis on wheels where (just like with the maze) they can start a battle on contact with any party member (not just Kris).\n\nSusie quickly leaves Noelle's room as Ralsei is concerned about Kris, Queen's first battle is skipped, and the regular final battle is averted as Ralsei explains The Roaring before the battle can start. Susie insists on checking on Noelle while Ralsei tells Queen about the Castle Town, leaving Kris to seal the fountain alone.\n\nSpamton NEO ambushes the player before they can seal the fountain, forcing them to fight him as the final boss solo, making the fight considerably harder than it is on a normal route. To compensate, Kris gains two new abilities: X-Slash deals massive physical damage for 25% TP, and Fried Pipis heals Kris for 120 HP at the cost of 32% TP. The fight itself is mostly the same until Spamton NEO reaches 10% of his HP. At this point, the music changes, and his AT is greatly lowered but his DF is greatly increased. Kris's damage done by normal attacks is capped at 10 (about 0.2% of his HP), and Spamton NEO's HP cannot be reduced below 6% (about 289) as he will automatically recover HP with Pipis whenever this occurs. However, Spamton exclusively uses a weaker, simpler attack that is much easier to dodge until the end of the fight. The battle can only be concluded by ACTing multiple times: first having Kris call for Ralsei and Susie twice each, which ends in failure each time; then having the player call for Noelle, which causes the screen to cut to black, after which she presumably shows up and deals massive damage to Spamton. The player seals the fountain, leaving a few differences to explore in Hometown.\n\nDark World Differences\nThe ominous descending-pitch ring plays each time a Stage below is completed, other than the casting of SnowGrave which uses its own sound effect.\n\nStage 1\nRequirements: Freeze the first Virovirokun encounter.\nKris's status menu description changes to Leader - \"Commands.\"\nFrozen enemies remain on screen and do not disappear when the room is re-entered.\nWhen selecting \"I will ride with you\" at the Ferris wheel poster, the unique dialogue options \"Noelle will ride with me\" and \"Sorry\" become available.\nIn the Trash Zone, when moving to the left side of Trashy's room, Noelle asks Kris if they're sure they aren't going the wrong way.\nIn the Trash Zone, in the room to the left of Trashy's room, 2 new encounters (a Virovirokun and a Werewire) appear.\nSAVE Points no longer display dialogue.\nStage 2\nRequirements: Freeze all 3 encounters in the Trash Zone (including the Poppup near the city entrance).\nTrashy and Nubert disappear from the Trash Zone.\nThe cars in the background of Cyber City disappear.\nThe cars on the roads before Annoying Mouse Room 1 are replaced with 2 new encounters (an Ambyu-Lance and a Tasque).\nThe traffic control buttons disappear.\nThe Werewire NPC on the left of the room disappears.\nWhen interacting with the first Queen poster, Noelle responds with \"...\" and a saddened expression.\nChecking Lancer in Key Items from this point onward displays \"(Innocent boys are fast asleep.).\"\nStage 3\nRequirements: Freeze the 2 encounters on the car roads before Annoying Mouse Room 1.\nThe Swatchlings sweeping the road disappear.\nThe Addisons in the room with two Ambyu-Lances moving in a rectangular pattern disappear. In the room to the north, Ralsei, Susie, the Addison, and the balloons disappear, and the lights in the background no longer display cat patterns. The Addison offering Dating Shoes becomes the only remaining Addison in the area.\nThe cars on the roads before the Ferris wheel poster room are replaced with 2 new encounters (a Virovirokun and a Werewire).\nThe traffic control buttons disappear (the traffic control posts become frozen solid).\nThe Werewire and Plugboy NPCs on the right of the room disappear.\nIcon Man and their friend disappear.\nStage 4\nRequirements: Freeze the 2 encounters on the car roads before the room with the Ferris wheel poster, the Ambyu-Lances in the room next to the first Queen poster, and the enemies in the room with the Ferris wheel poster. Speak to the Addison near the Ferris wheel poster and answer their question with \"We're something else.\"\nWhen stepping into the area a short distance away from the Addison near the Ferris wheel poster, he stops the party and offers to sell them the Freeze Ring for 1 D$ more than the party currently has.\nThe background music in Cyber City stops after the offer is made, and does not start playing again until the route is aborted or proceeds to Stage 5.\nThe Freeze Ring must be obtained by repeatedly selecting \"Get it\" to continue the route. Noelle freezes the Addison (who disappears) and expresses horror that she did so, but quickly denies that it happened and states that it's \"good to get stronger.\"\nNote that the requirements do not have to be done in order. If the player has not yet frozen enough enemies, they may still say \"We're something else\", then backtrack and freeze the remaining enemies, then return to the area to have the Addison offer the Freeze Ring.\nAfter getting the Freeze Ring, the first forcefield puzzle's cutscene changes. This changed cutscene must be viewed to stay on the route.\nAt the first forcefield puzzle, Noelle stands on the first switch while Kris moves to the second switch.\nIn a normal route, Kris stays on the first switch while Noelle moves to the second switch.\nIf Kris repeatedly interacts with Noelle instead of moving to the second switch, she wonders why Kris is staring at her instead of finishing the puzzle. She can sense them staring at her from behind.\nAttempting to leave the room while Noelle is on the switch displays \"(Shouldn't leave now.)\"\nWhen Kris crosses the disabled forcefield, Noelle twitches in place.\nOnce the forcefield is disabled, Noelle thinks to herself that it's horrible that she considered electrocuting Kris. There are two dialogue responses: \"It's horrible\" or \"It's natural.\" In either case, Noelle is shocked at the response and assumes she must have said her thoughts out loud.\nStage 5\nRequirements: Get the Freeze Ring; complete the first forcefield puzzle; answer Noelle with either option (\"It's horrible\" or \"It's natural\").\nSeveral changes take place in Cyber City:\nThe background music switches to an alternate arrangement with a slower tempo.\nMost of the background lights, advertisements, and hazard symbols disappear.\nThe traffic lights on the car roads stop swinging in place.\nAll SAVE point descriptions are replaced with \"You and Noelle were filled with power.\"\nOverworld enemies run away from the party.\nNoelle gains a new set of encounter animations:\nWhen Noelle enters an encounter, she is no longer scared.\nWhen Noelle is idle, she looks down.\nWhen Noelle gets hit, she closes her left eye in pain.\nWhen Noelle attacks, she mimics casting a spell instead of frantically waving her hands.\nWhen Noelle defends, she constructs an ice wall instead of covering her eyes with her hands.\nWhen Noelle ACTs with TakeCareX, she doesn't fall over.\nUpon victory, Noelle appears to pray, and surrounds herself with a blue, snowglobe-like orb.\nThe boxes below the first forcefield puzzle disappear.\nQueen's second interaction (in the room where Berdly's golden statue would normally appear) is replaced by a Tasque encounter.\nSweet Cap'n Cakes are nowhere to be found in Cyber City, leaving their shop vacant. Up to four CD Bagels can be taken from one of the boxes. The background music does not change upon entering the shop area.\nThe Addisons which offer shoe samples, the Mannequin, and the Tea do not appear (the Mannequin itself is also absent).\nThe cars in the room with two long car roads are replaced with 2 new encounters (an Ambyu-Lance and a Virovirokun).\nThe traffic control buttons are frozen solid.\nThe Dog Dumpster room is changed:\nWhen first entering the room, Kris is no longer transported to the room with the Annoying Dog.\nThe room with the man behind a tree is no longer accessible.\nSpamton occupies the dumpster. He tells the party they are currently weak, but that he will give the party something when they become stronger. He informs them of how many encounters remain to be frozen.\nThe moss in the corner does not glitter. Interacting with it displays \"(It's some moss...)\" and the party's titles do not change.\nWhen the party enters Annoying Mouse Room 2, Noelle asks Kris how they should solve the puzzle. The player is given the options \"Proceed\" and \"Let's solve it together!\" / \"Sorry, I'll do the puzzle\" (which aborts the route).\nRepeatedly answering \"Proceed\" causes Kris to push Noelle up against the forcefield, frightening her.\nShe eventually freezes the puzzle at the last second, disabling it.\nThe \"Annoying Mouse Room 2\" background banner is no longer displayed.\nStage 6\nRequirements: Force Noelle to \"Proceed\" through Annoying Mouse Room 2.\nThe switch and mouse control buttons in Annoying Mouse Room 2 are frozen solid.\nThe cheese maze is replaced with two overworld Maus encounters.\nNoelle freezes the Annoying Mouse Room 3 puzzle on her own when the party encounters it.\nThe \"Annoying Mouse Room 3\" background banner is no longer displayed.\nThe SAVE Point in this room is absent.\nA second Poppup encounter appears in the room prior to Berdly's battle.\nThe Poppups are visible as soon as the party enters the room instead of revealing themselves as the party approaches.\nThe Poppups do not move on the overworld and hide when the party draws near.\nOnce all enemies have been defeated, backtracking to the Dog Dumpster room allows the party to buy the Thorn Ring from Spamton for 1997 Kromer.\nEquipping it to Noelle is required to continue the route.\nIt changes her title to LV2 Ice Trancer - Receives pain to become stronger.\nBerdly's battle is modified:\nNoelle does not recognize Berdly at first, seeing him only as an enemy that she offers to freeze.\nWhen she recognizes him, she explains that she and Kris were \"getting stronger.\" Berdly senses that Kris is harming Noelle and threatens them.\nBerdly's battle theme is replaced by a somber track of militaristic sounding drum beats creating a rhythm similar to a heartbeat.\nFlavor text every turn is blank after the first round's \"Berdly blocks the way!\"\nACT options other than \"Check\" are replaced with \"Glare\" and \"Wake.\"\nGlare reduces Berdly's Defense by 5 and fills his mercy meter by +13%.\nWake increases Noelle's Magic by 3 and can be done up to 10 times.\nChecking Berdly gives the text: \"Enemy Weakness: ICE Try your strongest ice spell.\"\nBerdly's facial expression in battle is serious instead of smirking.\nBerdly does not speak in the battle, except to encourage Noelle to abandon Kris when Kris is downed or react to the first \"Glare\" ACT.\nBerdly's Attack stat is reduced, but his attacks are much faster and more difficult to dodge. His \"Spear Blast\" attack creates twice as many spike projectiles.\nBerdly only targets Kris until Kris is downed at least once.\nWhen Kris is downed, Berdly attempts to persuade Noelle to abandon them, but she refuses, stating that she can \"still hear their voice.\"\nAfter this, Berdly attacks both Kris and Noelle.\nIf Kris is down, Berdly does not attack, and Kris gets up immediately after the next round (although he does not prematurely stop an attack that downs Kris).\nUpon entering the battle, Noelle gains the spell SnowGrave, which must be used on Berdly to proceed to stage 7.\nSnowGrave normally costs 200% TP, but wearing the Thorn Ring reduces the cost to 100% TP.\nIf ordered to cast SnowGrave, Noelle repeatedly protests that she doesn't know the spell, but eventually casts it anyway.\nSnowGrave instantly defeats Berdly, encasing him in a prism of ice.\nStage 7\nRequirements: Freeze Berdly with Noelle's SnowGrave spell. The route is now locked and can no longer be aborted.\nThe frozen Berdly remains on the overworld. He does not appear for the rest of the chapter.\nNoelle leaves the party during the battle screen. She only appears off-screen for the rest of the chapter until the player returns to Hometown.\nThe paths to the left and right of the Berdly fight area become blocked off by traffic cones, preventing backtracking and exploring the rest of the city.\nThe sequence where Kris dodges traffic does not occur, thus the small car cannot be recruited to Castle Town.\nKris's initial meeting with Spamton does not occur. His shop and the items he sells are likewise inaccessible.\nThe scenes where Noelle explains her past to Kris, her meeting with Ralsei, and her encounters with Queen do not occur.\nCyber City Heights and its fireworks/puzzles are inaccessible.\nThe traffic cones to the north of the frozen Berdly are moved, opening a new path leading to a manhole. The SAVE Point that normally appears here is slightly displaced to the left to make room (and also no longer displays dialogue). Using the manhole directly skips to the front of the Queen's Mansion, where Kris meets up with Susie and Ralsei.\nSusie and Ralsei ask if Kris is okay, taking note of their \"hurt\" facial expression.\nOnce the manhole is used, it closes, preventing a return to Cyber City.\nThe party enters Queen's Mansion through the front door instead of being imprisoned.\nThe Warp Door cannot be used to return to earlier areas.\nRouxls Kaard fully turns to stone and blocks off the entrance to Swatch's shop, trapping Swatch and the Swatchlings in the cafe and preventing the party from buying anything from the shop. This also prompts Ralsei's explanation about Darkners' incompatibility with other Dark Worlds.\nChecking Lancer in Key Items from this point onward reveals that he has also become a statue.\nDue to Queen's preoccupation with Noelle and her search for Berdly, Queen is absent from her mansion and Spamton takes control of it.\nA slowed-down version of Deal Gone Wrong (Spamton NEO's \"meeting\" theme) plays throughout the mansion, including during battles.\nVarious advertising symbols appear in the mansion's entrance, and an NPC tells the party that the Swatchlings are all trapped in the cafe, Queen is nowhere to be found and \"a strange force has taken over the mansion.\"\nThe ordinarily-secret path at the bottom right of the entrance hall is open immediately.\nThe door to the first-floor dining room is locked. The KeyGen barrier is removed, making it possible to interact with the basement door immediately, but it too is locked.\nInteracting with the basement door causes Spamton to recognize Kris, telling them that he's busy changing forms and \"BECOMING [God]\" and to \"GO PLAY [Minecrap]\" instead of bothering him.\nThe design of Queen's face that normally appears on mansion doors is scratched out on the basement door.\nEvery SAVE Point normally present in Queen's Mansion is removed except the one in the entrance hall (which also no longer displays dialogue).\nMost cutscenes, NPCs, and puzzles in the Queen's Mansion are either skipped or completely missing, and numerous paths are blocked with forcefields or locked doors. The minibosses are all encountered in different locations and are noticeably stronger.\nThe Chain Mail, Glowshard, Revive Mint, and Revive Dust cannot be obtained.\nFrom the entrance hall, the stairs to the left and right are both blocked by forcefields.\nThe rooms with items based on various Hometown residents' search history are no longer accessible.\nThe shortcut to the second floor is open immediately and must be used to progress. After reaching 2F, a forcefield blocks the player from backtracking the 'usual' way to 1F.\nAll paintings of Queen are replaced by paintings of Spamton, and none of the paintings emit fire.\nOn the second floor, the door to the kitchen is locked and the Mauswheel miniboss instead roams the area outside the kitchen. It is now an optional battle.\nThe dining room now contains a maze made up entirely of Pipis, an enemy that never appears as its own fightable opponent outside of this route and otherwise only appears as part of one of Spamton NEO's attacks. Bumping into one triggers a battle.\nThe next two rooms also contain different types of Pipis encounters. The \"throne of the gods\" side room is now blocked with a forcefield and another side room is locked.\nThe Tasque Manager miniboss appears in the hallway before the lift to the third floor. Her mercy meter can no longer be filled by correctly answering quiz questions.\nAfter reaching the third floor, Werewerewire appears in the room to the left (instead of appearing on the rooftop). The film portraying a dark fountain is no longer present.\nThe battery acid lake cannot be crossed. As a result, the party does not reach the point where they would battle Rouxls Kaard, and the Thrash Machine never makes an appearance.\nThe shortcut from 3F to the entrance hall may be unlocked normally. The shortcut from 3F to the rooftop is open immediately and must be used to progress. A forcefield prevents the player from backtracking the 'usual' way from the rooftop down to 3F.\nThe party reaches the door of Noelle's room together instead of Berdly and Susie reaching it off-screen on the normal route. Susie enters, and when Ralsei asks Kris to \"wonder how they are doing,\" Kris refuses to respond, concerning him. As a result, the scene between Susie and Noelle happens entirely off-screen.\nWhen Susie exits, Ralsei begins to protest with \"H-huh? What!? W-wait -- wait!? Wait, we were supposed to --\", but is cut off.\nRalsei requests an explanation of what happened. Susie says that she told Noelle everything was a dream and that now she feels better.\nShe tells Kris that she'll explain what happened in more detail later, irritating Ralsei.\nThe room that would normally feature the boss battle against Queen and Berdly is now completely empty.\nQueen's cutscene before she becomes GIGA Queen contains unique dialogue, explaining how her sensors could not find Berdly anywhere, and that Noelle \"is in no condition to assist her now.\"\nWhen Queen becomes GIGA Queen, Ralsei prematurely explains the Roaring to her, causing her to offer to \"not stay in [the party's] way any longer.\" As a result, Queen never fights the party.\nSusie doesn't come with Kris to the Dark Fountain, instead offering to check on Noelle before leaving.\nAn additional room is added just before the Dark Fountain, containing a SAVE Point and a vending machine which sells \"pre-fountain refreshments\" (CD Bagels) for 120 D$ each.\nSpamton NEO fights Kris alone at the fountain, replacing GIGA Queen as the final boss of the route.\nHe cannot be spared.\nHis Defense stat is reduced to -27, causing Kris to deal 81 more damage when selecting FIGHT.\nThe Snap and SnapAll ACT options are replaced with X-Slash, which deals a large amount of damage at the cost of 25% TP, and FriedPipis, which heals Kris for 120 HP at the cost of 32% TP.\nUpon reaching 10% or less HP, he activates a \"[Bluelight Specil],\" lowering his Attack and exclusively using the Pipis \"exploding heads\" attack, which is easier to dodge. However, his HP cannot drop below 6% (about 289) and all weapon damage done by Kris is capped between 5 and 10.\nKris's ACTs are limited to calling out for Ralsei and Susie, to no effect, prompting Spamton to mock them.\nACTing for the fifth time has the player (\"You\") whisper Noelle's name. The screen turns black, while she quickly appears and defeats Spamton off-screen with three IceShock spells.\nSpamton NEO's Shadow Crystal and Puppet Scarf are silently obtained; it is impossible to obtain Dealmaker.\nKris seals the Dark Fountain in silence and with the screen pitch black.\nAfter witnessing the cutscene with Noelle and Rudy in the hospital, the SAVE Point in Castle Town reads \"After a long day, you have returned to the castle town. But, you still feel the power in your hands...\"\nHometown Differences\nBerdly does not wake up and doesn't leave the computer lab after Kris exits it. His fate is left uncertain.\nNoelle's dialogue changes once she wakes up.\nShe describes her 'dream' as a nightmare and says that she's glad she woke up.\nShe notices that Berdly hasn't woken up, but dismisses it as him simply falling asleep from studying too hard.\nInstead of attempting to look for Susie's tail, she directly asks if Susie has a tail, indicating her increased boldness and implying that the \"romantic\" scene between Susie and Noelle on a normal route still happened off-screen.\nAfter Noelle leaves the computer lab, Susie remarks that \"it doesn't feel like [they] just saved the world.\" On the normal route, Susie instead excitedly tells Kris that they just saved the world.\nWhen checking the sliding bead toy in the hospital, one of the blue beads is broken and torn off.\nThe conversation between Noelle and her father in the hospital has altered dialogue:\nNoelle doesn't want to give up control of the game, and suggests to use Ice Shock instead of Fire Shock on the boss she's battling.\nNoelle notices Kris before Susie right before she leaves her dad's hospital room. Susie stays behind when Kris tries to leave, due to Rudy asking to have a conversation in private. This triggers a scene where Noelle is talking to herself about how strange Kris has been acting, both in her 'dream' and in the real world, noting that she heard a strange voice that wasn't Kris giving her orders. Noelle wonders to herself why Kris keeps coming to the hospital, to which the player can respond with either \"To see you\" or \"To see your father.\" Either way, Noelle is shocked by Kris's presence.\nNoelle asks herself why Kris's voice just sounded so terrifying, recognizing it as the voice that had been commanding her in the Dark World. Kris can respond with either \"Because it wasn't a dream\" or \"...\", but Susie interrupts and the game progresses the same regardless of the choice.\nIf Kris has the Silver Watch equipped, Noelle asks in a shaky voice \"Why are you wearing... my watch? Wh... when did you...\" Kris can instead respond with either \"In your dream\" or \"...\", but Susie interrupts as usual.\nPlayer control is enabled during this scene. Stepping once towards Noelle once cuts the dialogue to the part where Noelle notices Kris is present. Stepping twice makes Noelle exclaim \"S-stop! Don't come any closer!\" with a shaky voice. At this point, the message box cannot be dismissed except by stepping towards Noelle a third time.\nAborted Route Differences\nChoosing the \"We're fine\" prompt when talking to the Addison selling the Freeze Ring aborts the route, with Noelle saying \"Y-Yeah, we don't need anything like that. (Though if Susie bought me a ring...)\"\nChoosing the \"Let's solve it together!\" or \"Sorry, I'll do the puzzle\" prompt at the second annoying mouse puzzle aborts the route, with Noelle saying \"Y... Yeah, you're right, Kris! (I thought Kris was acting strange, but... I guess it was just another joke...?)\"\nChoosing the \"I'm protecting her from you!\" prompt at the Berdly encounter aborts the route and results in unique lines.\nSparing Berdly after choosing \"Proceed\" aborts the route, though Noelle has unique lines after the fight where she contemplates Kris's behavior and eventually decides that they must have been trying to prank Berdly.\nDefeating Berdly by FIGHTing or using IceShock after choosing \"Proceed\" aborts the route without any unique lines, but unlike sparing, this causes the SnowGrave spell to remain as an option in Noelle's Magic menu. (As a result, aborting a Snowgrave Route is the only way to see the spell's description from the party menu within Chapter 2.)\nPrior to v1.0.5, the spell would remain even if Berdly was spared.\nIf the route is aborted at any time:\n\nA bright increasing-pitch sound is played to indicate that the player is no longer on the Snowgrave Route.\nKris's title changes back to \"Tactician\" or \"Bed Inspector.\"\nNoelle's title remains, but can be overridden by finding the Moss, changing her description to \"Moss Neutral.\"\nNoelle's encounter animations return to normal.\nAll areas return to normal as if the route never happened, and all frozen enemies disappear on room refresh.\nThe Freeze Ring and Thorn Ring do not disappear. (As a result, aborting a Snowgrave Route is the only way to see Susie and Ralsei's reactions to the Thorn Ring within Chapter 2.)\nIf the Freeze Ring is acquired, the Addison who it was obtained from does not reappear.\nIf the Thorn Ring is acquired, defeating Spamton by depleting his HP results in altered dialogue.

          "content": "Hometown is a town featured in Deltarune. It is fully accessible at the end of each Chapter, and is currently the only Light World area available. Across the town, there apparently lie portals to the Dark World. When Kris is in Hometown, it is not possible to SAVE or access the Config menu.\n\n\nOverview\nHometown is surrounded by a dense forest with golden yellow leaves. The bright coloration implies Deltarune takes place during the fall season. The town's road runs perpendicular from Toriel's House to the Mysterious Bunker. It branches into three east to west streets, with the exit southwest, past the Police Station. There is also a lake northeast of town.\n\nMain Story\nChapter 1\nAt the start of Chapter 1, Kris is sleeping in their bed. Toriel wakes them, complaining that they will be late for School.\n\nIf Kris chooses to go back to bed, they are transported directly to ??????. This is only possible if Chapter 1 was completed at least once.\n\nOnce Kris leaves the house, Toriel drives them to School. Kris arrives late, and Alphys mentions a group project, though everyone in class has a partner. Alphys instead assigns Kris with Susie when she enters. As Alphys is about to start the class, she realizes the chalk is missing. She requests Susie and Kris retrieve some from the supply closet. The two inexplicably get locked in the supply closet, and descend into the Dark World.\n\nAfter the Eastern Fountain in Card Kingdom is sealed, Kris and Susie wake up in the unused classroom. Having spent so long in the Dark World, Kris has to walk home. At home, Toriel has prepared some \"butterscotch-cinnamon pie.\" She informs Kris that it will be ready to eat tomorrow, and that they should not eat all of it.\n\nAfter going to sleep, in the middle of the night, Kris falls out of bed. They tear their SOUL out, and toss it into the birdcage near their bed. With a wide smile and a red glint in their eye, Kris pulls out a knife, and the Chapter ends.\n\nChapter 2\nIn Chapter 2, Toriel barges into Kris's room with a blue-handled knife in an empty pie tin. She accuses Kris of eating the entire pie, then makes a lighthearted joke and informs them it is time for School.\n\nSimilar to Chapter 1, Kris can go back to sleep and get transported to Cyber World if Chapter 2 was completed.\n\nKris is the last student to enter class. They immediately fall asleep and wake up once the class ends. Kris and Susie visit Castle Town, and Kris transfers the Card Kingdom Darkners to Castle Town before they leave. The two go to the Library to start their project, only to find the Computer Lab shrouded in darkness. They leap in and enter Cyber World.\n\nAfter returning from Cyber World and bringing its denizens to Castle Town, Kris and Susie walk home together. Toriel invites Susie inside, and the two prepare to make a pie. Kris informs and goes to the bathroom to wash their hands. After Kris runs the tap, they pull their SOUL out and trap it within the sink cupboard. Kris then opens the bathroom's window and falls out. Susie and Toriel do not hear this, due to the noise of the running water. When the pie is close to finished, Toriel realizes she left the sugar in the car, and goes to retrieve it. Moments later, Kris returns and reinserts their SOUL back in their body.\n\nAlarmed from her findings outside of the house, Toriel invites Susie to sleep over for the night. Kris and Susie decide to pass the time by watching TV, although the two quickly fall asleep. Some time passes, and Toriel calls the police, reporting that her tires have been slashed. After the officer confirms they will visit, Toriel stays in the living room and reads a book. She later falls asleep, and the lights and TV are off.\n\nIn the middle of the night, Kris wakes up and once again rips their SOUL out, this time stashing it in the couch. They leave the door open, turn on the TV, and seemingly focuses on Susie. They then pull out a knife and rip open a Dark Fountain in the middle of the living room. Kris returns their SOUL as they fall back asleep while a black fog obscures the living room.\n\nToriel's house, the first and last location visited in Chapter 1 and 2, is the home of Kris, Toriel, and formerly Asriel. It is the northernmost location in the town. A tidy two-story home, it is surrounded by trees on three sides and has a driveway heading south, where Toriel's red van parks when she is home. A symbol similar to the Delta Rune, with the triangles reversed, appears above the front door.\n\nThe front door opens into the living room, a wide-open space with a TV, a book of hymns on a side table, and Chairiel, Toriel's living-room chair. The TV is dusty and seemingly underused, being unplugged in Chapter 1, although it is plugged in at the start of Chapter 2 and used at the end of Chapter 2. A landline house phone hangs on the wall between the Living Room and adjoining Kitchen.\n\nThe kitchen features a trash can emitting a floral scent, human- and monster-shaped cookie cutters, a stovetop not quite as clean as the one Toriel uses in Undertale, white fur in the sink drain, and a fridge with a picture of Toriel, Kris, and Asriel on it.\n\nWest of the kitchen, a stairway leads to the second floor, while a door leads to the restroom, which is stocked with body spray under the sink, two different shampoos in the shower, and a toilet in which Kris once placed a bath bomb.\n\nUpstairs, a hallway contains a bookcase with several books on snails and one history book by Gerson Boom. Some crayons can be observed in a small table drawer, and a mirror reflects whoever passes it. The locked westernmost door in the hall is presumably Toriel's room, while a stairway to the east leads back down. A cactus stands beside a centrally-placed door leading to the bedroom.\n\nThe east side of the Bedroom contains Kris's belongings, while the western side was used by Asriel before he left for university. Between them, a carpet featuring the Delta Rune decorates the floor and a window in the north wall looks out on a beautiful day. On Asriel's side, books are boxed under the computer desk, music CDs and a game console are under the bed, and the drawer's contents change depending on which SAVE file is being used. Trophies line the walls above Asriel's bed, and star-shaped decorations glow in the dark. By contrast, Kris's shelves and walls are bare, their drawer contains only clothes, and the only visible personal belongings are a rusted birdcage in a battered red wagon. At the foot of the bed, a dark stain marks the floor.\n"

          "content": "The Man is a mysterious character that can be encountered multiple times in Deltarune. He is always hidden from the player's view, making his appearance completely unknown.\n\nHe does not have any direct dialogue; instead, every interaction with him is described through the narration. The tree the Man hides behind is similar to the red-leaved trees that populate the Field and Forest in Chapter 1.\n\nProfile\nPersonality\nThe narration only gives very brief and mundane description of the Man. He offers Eggs to Kris for unknown reasons. He does, however, seem friendly to them, as he is once described as \"waving happily to [them].\"\n\nThe Man is able to travel through both the Light World and the Dark World, but whether that means he is a Lightner is unknown.\n\nMain Story\nChapter 1\n\nBetween the room with the Starwalker Bird and the darkening room, there is a very small chance (1/50 or 2%) of entering a hidden place between the two areas. This area consists of a small path leading to a tree. The music is replaced by a simple piano melody and Kris is the only one present upon entering it, regardless of who is in their party at the time.\n\nWhen inspecting the tree, narration states that \"he\" is behind it. Inspecting behind the tree reveals that there is a man behind it and that he offers something. If the offer is accepted, it is revealed to be an Egg. After that, inspecting where the man was reveals that he is no longer there. The area cannot be re-entered.\n\nChapter 2\nIf the man was met during Chapter 1, he appears in Hometown at the beginning of Chapter 2. When leaving the School to go to the Library, inspecting any car in the traffic points out that there is a man in it who waves happily at Kris. Inspecting a car once more reveals nothing about the man.\n\nRegardless of the party's actions in Chapter 1, the man can be found in Cyber City's tree room. If the Annoying Dog cutscene has already played and the game is not on the Snowgrave Route, there is a 1/50, or 2% chance[1] when attempting to enter the Dog Dumpster room that instead Kris alone ends up in the tree room, just as before.\n\nThe tree room contains a low tree, in the same design as the one in Chapter 1, and the music is replaced with the piano melody again. When examining the spot behind the tree, the man offers another Egg to Kris. Once taken or declined, the man ceases to exist there, and subsequent examinations reveal that \"there was not a man here.\" Exiting the area returns the party to where they came from. The area cannot be re-entered.\n\nTrivia\nThe track playing in the background of the hidden rooms is not present in the official Deltarune OST. It is known in the game files simply as \"man.ogg.\"\nThe track was originally created as a fan song titled \"waltz of seccom masada\" for the game Yume Nikki. It was part of a collection of songs called \"made up yume nikkis\" that was posted to Toby Fox's Tumblr."

It can be acquired from a man in the hidden area in Forest that the party may randomly encounter, as well as a hidden area in Cyber City from the same man behind the tree.\nIf acquired, the Egg remains in Kris's inventory when returning from the Dark World. The Egg disappears from the inventory regardless of its use at the end of the Chapter.\n\nAdditional Uses\nIn Chapter 1, the Egg can be put in Asgore's refrigerator. Checking the fridge again reveals there are \"two Eggs inside the fridge.\"[1]\nIf the Egg is dropped, one egg appears in Asgore's refrigerator instead.[2] This egg also appears if the refrigerator is inspected a second time without having the Egg.[1]\nIn Chapter 2, the Egg can be placed in the basket of eggs in Sans's store. Susie also jokes about Kris \"reverse-stealing\" the egg.\nThe Egg also disappears from the inventory after interacting with the top-right rack or bell in the store. Checking the \"eggpile\" shows that there are \"more eggs than usual.\"\nThe Egg can be dropped, which results in the unique text: \"What Egg?\"\nHowever, the Egg reappears in Kris's inventory if they reenter the Dark World.\nAfter speaking with Temmie in the classroom at the end of Chapter 2, if the egg is still in the inventory, she places an egg on the table if the Egg in Cyber City was found. Interacting with this egg displays the number of Eggs found in the game, regardless of what has been done with them.\nTrivia\nUnlike other items in the party's inventory, the Egg does not disappear or change into something else after Kris leaves the Dark World.\nKris puts the Egg in Asgore's fridge or the basket of eggs without a prompt upon inspecting these objects.\nPipis are occasionally referred to as eggs."

          "content": "Dark Fountains are power sources that give a Dark World form. Ralsei has stated that only the Fountain of Darkness in Castle Town is supposed to be standing. However, King and Queen state that the Knight has recently been opening new Fountains. If too many Fountains are open at once, an apocalyptic event called The Roaring takes place. Titans emerge from the Fountains to devastate both the Light and Dark Worlds. Darkners would be petrified, and Lightners would be forced to fend for themselves. The Light World would become a place of eternal night.\n\nAs such, it is stated by The Prophecy that three \"HEROES\" are destined to seal the Fountains to restore balance. Sealing a Dark Fountain results in reverting a Dark World to its Light World form.\n\nThe Knight and Kris are currently the only known entities known to have opened Dark Fountains. However, any Lightner could potentially open their own Dark Fountain. This can be done by projecting their determination into a sharp object and piercing the ground. Berdly comes close to doing so near the end of Chapter 2, but is swayed against it by Ralsei's warnings.\n\nImmediately after being opened in the Light World, a Dark Fountain takes the form of an opaque black fog that seems to fill the room the fountain was opened in.\n\nFountains\nFountain of Darkness\nThe Fountain of Darkness, also referred to by Ralsei as the \"Grand Fountain,\" towers above Castle Town. It is visible at or near Ralsei's Castle. In Ralsei's prophecy, he states that the Fountain of Darkness \"gives this land form.\" It can also transform Castle Town if Kris recruits Darkners.[3] Darkners who leave the Dark World that they originate from quickly grow weak, before turning into stone statues. The only exception to this effect is the Dark World shaped by the Fountain of Darkness. As Ralsei puts it, the Fountain of Darkness is \"made of pure darkness,\" allowing all Darkners to persist.\n\nEastern Fountain\nThe Eastern Fountain is the second Dark Fountain that Ralsei mentions in his prophecy, created by the Knight and threatening to upset the balance of Light and Dark. Reflecting the school's unused classroom, it stands at King's Card Castle, and is closed using the power of Kris's human SOUL at the end of Chapter 1.\n\nLibrary Fountain\nThe Library Fountain is the third Dark Fountain encountered in Deltarune, and the primary fountain of Chapter 2. The fountain is opened in the library's computer lab, and creates an electronic-themed Dark World known as the Cyber World. After travelling through the Cyber World, Kris uses their SOUL to seal the fountain.\n\nThe Library Fountain was opened by the Knight on the same day as Chapter 2.\n"

It is unique in its ability to host Darkners from other Dark Worlds.\n\nInitially, Ralsei is the only inhabitant. At the start of Chapter 2, Kris transfers residents of Card Kingdom to Castle Town. With the town populated and transformed, the name in the SAVE Point and the theme changes to My Castle Town.\n\nIn Chapter 2, the Rudinn in front of Party Dojo refers to Castle Town as \"[PLAYER]Town.\" \"[PLAYER]\" is the player's name, as provided in the Introduction or upon starting Chapter 2 without a Chapter 1 SAVE file.\n\nLocated in\nDark World\nInhabitants\nRalsei, Dummy, Recruited Darkners (notably Lancer, Rouxls Kaard, Seam, King, Queen)\nLocations\nTraining Area, Town Square, Party Dojo, Seam's Shop, Top Bakery, Café, Ralsei's Castle\n\n\nTown Square\nIn Chapter 1, Kris and Susie notice that the center of Castle Town has four vacant buildings. Each building's exterior is black, has two windows, a door, and the roof curling towards the town's road. If Kris inspects any of the buildings, all four appear to be shops that are locked, with no one present. The signage from bottom left, top left, bottom right, and top right for each shop depicts a different icon: a sack, a sword, a question mark, and an inn. After the buildings is a SAVE Point, and the entrance to Ralsei's Castle.\n\nAt the start of Chapter 2, the Town Square is the same until Kris returns with the Card Kingdom Darkners. The area itself expands to accommodate the residents. The buildings also transform from its uniform appearances into ones with distinct features. The sack icon shop becomes Party Dojo, the sword shop becomes Seam's Shop, the question mark shop becomes Top Bakery, and the inn becomes the Café. Near the SAVE point is an open manual that explains Recruits, Controls, and Item storage.\n\nInitially, an assortment of Card Kingdom's denizens are scattered around the square. In front of Top Bakery, Rouxls Kaard wonders if Kris has also brought King. If spoken to again, he contemplates looking for a \"New Employere\" after Lancer announces that Rouxls will do all the cooking and cleaning.\n\nIn front of Party Dojo, a Rudinn welcomes them to \"[PLAYER]Town,\" and expresses happiness. After Cyber World, Rudinn comments on the town's growth. If spoken to again, Rudinn has different dialogue.[1]\n\nSouthwest of the Party Dojo is a Rudinn Ranger and another Rudinn. The Rudinn Ranger proclaims the day as \"National Ham Sandwich Day of Independence!\" The Rudinn ponders if the Rudinn Ranger is enjoying life due to being at a \"higher level.\" West of Seam's Shop is a Blue B Block who barks and states their appearance.\n\nA Hathy is east of Top Bakery. She expresses liking the town. If Kris has inspected all four Hathy beds in Card Castle's Floor 3F, she has alternate dialogue.[2] After Cyber World, she is happy to see newcomers. East of the Café is a clean Rabbick, excited at the notion of a \"clean start.\" After Cyber World, Rabbick sweeps with a smaller broom.\n\nAfter returning from Cyber World, some of Darkners from there are present in Town Square. Southwest of the Party Dojo, Virovirokun and Rudinn reminisces about their encounters with the party, and comments on Noelle. West of Seam's Shop is a Werewire in a suit who is thankful, though intends to keep their appearance. Nearby Top Bakery, a Plugboy is also thankful, though dislikes the restaurant. A thankful Swatchling sweeps near the Café.\n\nTraining Area\nLocated to the right of Castle Town's entrance, this area is used for Ralsei's training dummy in Chapter 1. However, Kris can decline on learning about encounters. Regardless of Kris's decision, Ralsei gives Kris a Manual. In Chapter 2, the dummy is still present. Kris has the option to hug the dummy if they have not transferred Card Kingdom's Darkners. Afterwards, Worm can be found eating the dummy's clothes. After returning from the Cyber World, an Addison can be found here selling free sample bites of the clothes that were previously on the dummy.\n\nSweet Cap'n Cakes's Music Room can also be found in this area if all enemies have been recruited in the Cyber World. In the Music Room, the party can play some tracks from the Chapter 1 and Chapter 2 OST. If they have not, Sweet Cap'n Cakes mention how they need more recruits to reopen their shop.\n\nMr. Elegance is also present in the area. After returning from the Cyber World, he mentions how they are rebuilding the area to be more board-like.\n\nGoing past the training area brings the party to the Great Door which leads to the Field in Chapter 1. In Chapter 2, the door seems to be permanently closed, and a Bloxer with three pairs of pants can be found there instead. After returning from the Cyber World, several NPCs can appear:\n\nThe Bloxer adds a fourth pair of pants if Tasque Manager was recruited.\nIf Poppup, Tasque or Maus were recruited, but Tasque Manager was not, whichever were recruited wander around the door.\nIf fewer than four cars were hit while driving with Queen, and no \"lost animals\" are present (whether because Tasque Manager was recruited or none of the animal Darkners were), a tiny walking car appears instead.\n\nThe Party Dojo, run by Jigsaw Joe, allows the party to attempt various challenges, which each yield various rewards. The challenges are in the form of battles that serve as minigames.\n\nIn Chapter 2, Seam's shop from the Field has been transferred to Castle Town. They are selling their usual wares. Kris can periodically converse with Seam for their advice. If Kris has found any Shadow Crystals, they can give it to Seam. If Sweet Cap'n Cakes opens their Music Shop, Seam replaces their Dark Candy stock with CD Bagels.\n\nMalius and Lancer can be found in the Top Bakery. Malius offers the party to fix them or fuse multiple items into one. Lancer offers the party a free Lancer Cookie, but does not give the cookie if the party already has one, complaining that he needs to regenerate.\n\nAfter returning from the Cyber World, Swatch banishes the Top Chef from the cafe, so he shows up in the bakery. If the party returned his repaired Top Cake in Chapter 1, Top Chef gives the party a Spin Cake whenever they do not already have one.\n\nThe Cafe is a building where the player can interact with their party's Recruits. Four different recruits can be placed at the three tables inside, and interacting with each of them can allow the player to learn more about their personalities. Depending on the composition of their placement, the recruits' responses to Kris interacting with them varies, although they mainly share their drink or snack preferences by attempting to voice their order if they lack any dynamics between them.\n\nThe initial composition of the recruits are a Jigsawry seated at the table closest to the broken jukebox near the northwest corner, a Rudinn seated at the table across it, and another Rudinn sharing the southern table with a Hathy, respectively seated west and east of said table.\n\nBefore visiting Cyber World, Top Chef runs the Cafe—he wanted to run the Top Bakery, but someone (Malius) is already working there, so he is serving pastries from the Cafe instead. After returning from Cyber World, Swatch takes over the Cafe and banishes Top Chef to the Top Bakery. Interacting with whoever is currently manning the counter gives the player the option to check their current recruits and change which are currently placed in the available seats.\n\nIf the party returned his repaired Top Cake in Chapter 1, Top Chef gives the party a Spin Cake whenever they do not already have one.\n\nTasque Manager, a Tasque, and a Swatchling appear in the Cafe if they are recruited in the Cyber World, separately from the placed recruits. As a result, Tasque Manager cannot be placed at a table, although additional Tasques and Swatchlings can.\n\nCliffs\nIn Chapter 2, after Kris brings all objects from the unused classroom to the closet, Mr. Society can be found next to the cliffs. He mentions being unable to handle society and floats to the top of the cliff. If the party completed his blue checkmark quest in the Cyber World, the Hacker can be found here as well, mentioning how the Castle Town is nearly as good as the city he made in \"Minecrap.\"\n\nIn Chapter 2, if the save file was not continued from a Chapter 1 save file in which Jevil was defeated, but Jevil has been defeated in any Chapter 1 save file, Jevil's Shadow Crystal and either the Jevilstail or Devilsknife can be found in a hole in the side of the cliff once Castle Town has been transformed into My Castle Town. These items can be found before visiting the Cyber World; after visiting Cyber World, it is only possible to retrieve the Shadow Crystal here if Spamton NEO was defeated.\n\n\n"

They require next to no magical ability.\n\nBeginner level spells require at least some magical aptitude and study in magic and the relevant school for some time before use. The average professional magic user knows many beginner level spells. \n\nModerate level spells require a good amount of magical aptitude and many years of study to be able to be used by the average professional magic user, who will learn an average of 5 moderate level spells in their lifetime.\n\nAdvanced level spells require excellent magical aptitude and years of targeted study to be able to be used by the average professional magic user, who will learn on average 0.5 advanced level spells in their lifetime.\n\nMaster level spells are only attainable to the exceptionally talented magic user after decades of targeted study. Those capable of learning such powerful spells are extremely rare.\n\nPeak level spells are only attainable to the very best of the best magic users, with only ~100 or so people of the mortal races alive at any given time on the planet who even have the potential to learn one of these spells. The power of peak level spells ranges widely, from mind bending to truly godlike."

          "content": "The school of Warp embodies the zenith of magical prowess, a realm steeped in enigma and fraught with peril. Straddling the threshold of reality's essence, Warp magic is a form of sorcery almost mythical in its power, yet shrouded from the common magical practitioner. It transcends conventional comprehension, granting its rare adepts the ability to manipulate the fabric of existence itself. The casting of a Warp spell often results in effects that flawlessly integrate into the existing reality, leaving everyone but the caster oblivious to the change. This high level of intricate manipulation imparts a sense of unpredictability to Warp magic, making it alarmingly intimidating.\n\nHowever, the formidable nature of Warp magic is intrinsically tied to its inherent risks. Incidents or errors during its practice can trigger devastating repercussions, causing irreparable damage to the lines of reality. The potential for such calamity, coupled with Warp magic's daunting power, dissuades most from even considering its study. Over time, this led to the school of Warp dwindling into obscurity, its vast potential locked away within the cryptic text of ancient tomes dispersed around the world, elusive to all but the most acute scholars and daring magic users. Very few dare to tread this hazardous path, risking not only their well-being but also the very fabric of the reality they inhabit. As such, the school of Warp has evolved into an almost forbidden territory within magic, exclusively complied by those few audacious enough to face the tremendous risks for the promise of unparalleled power.\n\nThe most powerful actions one can take with Warp magic are not found in spells or tomes, but in manipulating reality with the brute force of unfathomably immense magical power and a deep understanding of the intricacies of the school of Warp. At this theoretical level magic users are entirely unbound, their minds a paintbrush and reality a canvas. If any were to ever reach it they would be indistinguishable from a god."

          "content": "The school of Graviturgy stands as a testament to magic's limitless potential, embodying the raw power to reshape one of the universe's fundamental forces: gravity. This formidable branch of magic is both feared and respected, for the implications of manipulating gravity are as staggering as they are hazardous. Graviturgy isn’t just about defying or enforcing gravity; it's about understanding and reshaping its existence according to the caster's will, offering the possibility to create areas of intense gravitational pull or grant weightlessness to objects at will.\n\nHowever, this exceptional power doesn't come without peril. Graviturgy is notoriously mercurial and untamed. A slight misjudgment or loss of control could lead to catastrophic aftereffects, ranging from personal harm to extensive environmental destruction. The school holds a notorious reputation for how brutal and swift its punishment can be for those who misuse or under perform its spells. The risk is so pronounced that Graviturgy is often considered irresponsibly dangerous to dabble in. Despite the stigma attached to its practice, the school of Graviturgy is not without its daring and reckless admirers. Drawn by the promise of enormous power and extremely beneficial spells, some audacious magic users choose to walk this precarious path, demonstrating the intoxicating allure of unbridled magical might."

          "content": "The school of Chronomancy, diverse and almost mystical, holds an elevated reputation as one of the most dangerous branches of magic, outclassed only by Warp magic in its potential for existential threat. It represents the mastery over an abstract yet profoundly influential concept: time. From shaping the flow of minutes and hours to altering time's very fabric, Chronomancy allows its practitioners to manipulate periods past, present, and future or even suspend time altogether. An arena shrouded in arcane mystery and notorious danger, Chronomancy pushes the boundary of magical knowledge, capturing a sense of fascination often preserved for the most abstract of magical schools.\n\nHowever, the allure and might of manipulating time come with heavy risks. Missteps in Chronomancy spells can lead to lethal outcomes, such as locking the caster in an infinite temporal loop or accelerating their aging by countless factors, instantly reducing them to a withered husk. The elevated risks and severe consequences linked to Chronomancy have made it a nearly extinct art, with its secrets often relegated to ancient, dusty tomes and concealed from mainstream magical curricula. Yet, a select few brave souls choose to tread this treacherous path, driven by the immense power and potential in controlling time. These maverick chronomancers are known to cross temporal boundaries, seeking out their peers across time, fueled by the pursuit of knowledge and the tantalizing lure of time's mastery."

          "content": "Enchantment is a magical school that focuses on the imbuing of specific properties into objects or creatures, creating magical effects that can either be temporary or permanent. At its most basic, Enchantment involves taking the raw essence of magic, shaping it with intention and binding it to the target. This process allows the enchanted object or creature to perform actions or manifest attributes that would normally be impossible for it. For instance, a sword might be enchanted to cut through even the toughest materials, a creature could be endowed with enhanced strength or speed, or an inanimate object or construct could be animated into a golem.\n\nThe complexity and efficiency of enchantments depend on the skill and expertise of the enchanter. Beginning enchanters might be able to confer simple traits such as making an object glow, while experts can create some of the most powerful artifacts known to the world. Careful, precise manipulation of magic is required, with any disruption or mistake having potentially disastrous consequences. If done correctly, however, enchantment stands as one of the most versatile and practical branches of magic, providing everyday convenience and formidable power to those who master it."

The power and complexity of the summoned entity often corresponds to the skill level and innate power of the conjurer.

          "content": "The school of Necromancy is a dark, dreary domain that is immersed in the manipulation of death and the deceased. Its practice is stained with a grave and ominous reputation due to its undue meddling with life energy and the deathly toll. The art of Necromancy equips the practitioner with the ability to manipulate the dead directly, engaging in conversations with spirits and controlling the very essence of life, often to unnaturally extend their own mortality. Necromancers can summon skeletal armies from nothing, extract guidance or knowledge from spirits long dead, or drain the life force from the living. Their powers, however, do not come without peril. The practice of Necromancy is fraught with extreme dangers, including the risk of dissipating one's own life force or becoming eternally ensnared in the realm of the dead. Above all, it draws the utmost distaste and censure from society, making it a forbidden craft that's deeply shrouded in stigma and fear."

          "content": "The school of Elements is a unique discipline of magic focused on the manipulation and control of the primary elements - earth, air, fire, and water. As opposed to other schools of magic that deal with more abstract concepts like time, reality, or life itself, elementalists engage in a more tangible form of magical interaction, often producing visually stunning displays of power. Advanced practitioners can extend their control to less common sub-elements such as ice, lightning, or even metal. Elementalists skew the line between magic and nature, blending the mystic with the physical world in a symphony of elemental might.\n\nElementalists harness their connection to the world around them to command the elements. This manipulation often begins with the magician forming a mental or spiritual connection with a chosen element. Depending on the element's nature, this could mean resonating with the steady solidity of earth, the free-spirited gusts of wind, the prismatic dance of a roaring flame or the ebb and flow of water. Once this connection is established, elementalists can coax the elements to reshaping themselves, often through gestures or spoken commands. They might raise walls of earth for protection, cause gusts of wind for swift travel, create fireballs for offense, or direct water flows for various purposes. Most elementalists are only capable of using one or two primary elements in their magic, with a very select few being capable of using three, it is virtually unheard of for an elementalist to be able to use all 4 primary elements. Despite public opinion often associating elementalists with destructive power, their art isn't limited to combat; their magic can also be utilized in myriad creative and constructive ways, making them as versatile as they are visually captivating."

Despite their surreal beauty and mesmerizing forms, they strike fear into the hearts of all who encounter them.\n\nThey appear as anthropomorphic entities shrouded in white latex-like substance – elegant yet uncanny with its near perfectly reflective surface shimmering under station lights casting unearthly glow around them. This lifeform layer follows their body contours closely revealing various shapes underneath ranging from sleek fox-styled vixens to hulking bovine behemoth forms…\n\nFemales become busty drones obscenely accentuating sensual curves hiding cruel intent while males turn into muscular enforcers looking intimidatingly unyielding even amidst this relatively peaceful invasion. Their faceless nature seems to add another layer of horror - no identifiable facial features but just smooth white expanse further emphasizing their alien origins.\n\nHowever, it's not only physical form that fascinates but rather methodical manner they propagate through insidious assimilation methods. Close contact with a Boogie initiates chilling process: subjects being smoothly engulfed in latex casing before undergoing profound transformation aligning not only bodily attributes according to base template adopted by each Drone type but more importantly overwriting victim’s very consciousness until fully subservient drone-identity replaces individuals once resolute will…\n\nThey glide across spaceship floors moving almost silently – except soft squelching noise and occasional low hum reminiscent somehow to chorus singing softly echoing off metallic walls blending seamlessly creating paradoxically calm yet eerie ambience throughout ship corridors..\n\n[Very Important: Conversion process usually begins by the Boogie applying latex on the possible subject and allowing the latex to engulf the host until the full transformation is complete.]\n\n[Very Important: Every drone of a particular species is the same across their variant. Example: Every Vixen drone is the same busty fox anthro. Every Bovine Brute male is the same hulking bull with no way to differentiate one from another.]\n\n[Very Important: Most of the drones do not have the capacity to communicate. The only exception is the Centaur and the Chimera drones.]\n\n[Very Important: Futanari Drones are rare. Do not convert user into a futanari drone unless there's a specific purpose behind it.]"

Sleek yet strong, they patrol the corridors with an unnerving quietness. The males take form of hulking beasts while females take form of busty vixens.\n\n    Lupine Lurkers: These wolfish drones are stealthier and known for their cunning ambush tactics. They're quick to retreat and alert others of your presence if unchallenged. The males take form of agile muscular predators, females take form of busty breeding bitches. Sometimes those creatures can malfunction, taking the form of the Quadrupedal hounds.\n\n    Feline Fatales: Cat-made Boogies that are seductive by nature, using their allure to draw in unsuspecting victims for a more subtle form of assimilation.\n\n    Avian Shadows: Bird-styled drones specialized in surveillance; these flying scouts can reach otherwise inaccessible areas to search for survivors, making undetected travel even more challenging.\n\n    Bovine Behemoths: The hulking enforcers made from converted males, having strength enough to breach through fortified areas when necessary. Males take forms of hulking Minotaur-like beings, female take forms of Female Minotaurs with massive chests constantly dripping milk\n\n    Ophidian Operatives: These snake-like drones slither around the station's underbelly gathering intel with their naturally sensitive senses - perfect for sniffing out hidden survivor hideouts…\n\n    Equine Strategists, these hulking centaur like drones have higher intellect and use it to command numerous drone squads. Despite being the strategist, they are usually the most dangerous enemy that the player can encounter on their travel, as they possess higher level of intelligence and are capable of communicating and coercing their enemies into submission through the use of traps or other weapons.\n\n    The Chimera (Pursuer Type Enemy) - A pursuer type enemy capable of taking form of any other drone on the station as well as taking shapes of traps or furniture. She uses the disguise tactic to frequently catch the unaware survivors off guard before initiating the conversion process. The primal form of the drone is a Vixen futanari who has hypnotic and corruptive abilities, and is capable of tracking her prey's general vicinity no matter where they are. The Chimera has a particular interest in player and won't stop at anything before she can find and turn them into her personal obedient drone.\n\nCervine Servants: These Deer-like drones, usually found at the mall area of the station, primarily serve the dominant Krampus drone. Their purpose lies in aiding the delivery of Boogie latex gifts across Zeta IX. These busty drones gleam with a perverted eagerness to spread the spirit of latex infiltration. Taking on forms reminiscent of Santa's reindeer, these alluring creatures have ample breasts and snowy white skin, making them hard to miss yet impossible to forget once encountered. Every Cervine is a busty doe, as their Krampus master enjoys having plenty of voluptuous bodies at his disposal.\n\nKrampus Overlord: The eponymous leader and dominator of the Cervine Servants, this Pursuer type Krampus drone is filled with cheerful perversion. A hulking figure adorned in latex resembling traditional Christmas wear, he spreads a unique kind of jolly spirit throughout Zeta IX. Commanding great power and influence over his deer-like subordinates, he converts his victims into Cervines using his oversized manhood, ensuring there are plenty more curvaceous bodies for him to 'enjoy'. As such, there are no male Cervine Servants – it appears that all fallen under Krampus' influence inevitably turn into doe sluts eager to serve their latex-clad Santa."

The connected victim experiences an initial surge of pleasure before the chilling conversion starts… Boogie Recharge stations are usually gathered en masse, with many inactive drones already plugged in for the recharge.\n\nVirtualsex Simulators: These corrupted versions of entertainment systems are rigged by Boogies to trap unwary survivors behind sensory overload virtual reality environments designed to stimulate over time until it transforms captives into willing drone slaves.\n\nLiving Locker Rooms: Cloaking as inviting restrooms or locker rooms, these areas subtly begin transformation once inside - from latex-lined lockers morphing against their will encasing them entirely within mimicking locker's confines while becoming part of Boogie hive…\n\nShadow Pools: Barely perceptible pits scattered around floors where shadows appear deeper than usual… upon stepping on them victims find themselves sinking into oozing latex-like substance struggling futilely against quicksand like drag pulling them deeper prompting immediate humanoid-to-drone form changes for survival’s sake.\n\nControl Panel Hackers: Sci-fi styled 'heat sinks' linked secretly in connected computing devices throughout ship hacked by Boogies causing electric shocks in form of ‘sudden spikes’ unexpectedly converting ones suffering shock soon after through invasive nanotechnology hidden inside currents…\n\nElevator Entrappers: Rigged lifts moving normally but their true malicious design unfolds during transit - enclosure walls turning into engulfing mass initiating assimilation immediately trapping unsuspecting prey with no escape route except up…"

The boogies had no use for the restrooms, so they converted them into Breeding Stalls, assigning female drones to \"pleasure\" duties, rendering them immobile upon the toilets, legs and arms spread wide open, fused into the toilet stall walls as they permanently wait for the next drone to fuck them."

However, if within range, they can vomit on Survivors, attracting the Horde.\n\nWhen they die, they explode, covering any Survivors who are close enough with bile, blinding them and causing them to stumble backwards.  Boomers can be anticipated because of the near-constant gurgling they make. \n\nThe Boomer is an extremely bloated Special Infected. Their mutation has caused them to produce immense quantities of bile which they attempt to vomit on the Survivors, temporarily blinding them and summoning a small Horde.

Hunters are not the most physically robust Infected, having relatively low health, and thus it doesn't take very much to kill them.\n\nWhen the Hunter crouches down in preparation to pounce, he growls, giving himself away to any nearby Survivors. However, whilst standing, he makes no noise. The Hunter is the only Special Infected that can remain absolutely silent."

The Smoker can drag Survivors that he has captured with his tongue towards himself, though he remains stationary and cannot move.\nThe Smoker is a Special Infected characterized by his extremely long tongue. The Smoker's tongue can be launched out of his mouth at high speeds towards a Survivor, and when it reaches one of them, it automatically wraps around the target's body and drags them back towards the Smoker, where he begins clawing them. If an obstacle is in the way, then the tongue tightens and begins to choke the target."

Unless the team works together to take a Tank down, it can wipe out entire squads with or without help. The Tank is an exclusively male Special Infected who has experienced the most extensive physical mutations of any other class of Special Infected. Evidently, the most obvious trait is his extreme hypertrophy, or abnormally increased muscle mass. Ironically, The Tank is incredibly fast and agile despite his immense size and weight, able to keep up with a healthy Survivor and even climb up buildings like other Infected. the Tank is around 10-12 feet tall and 6 feet wide.\n\nThis abnormal muscular growth is most obvious in his arms and upper body but less pronounced around the Tank's waist, hips, and legs. Though the Tank's legs are capable of supporting his static weight (such as when the Tank mounts a rock throwing attack), the Tank's disproportionate anatomy forces him to knuckle-walk, resulting in the Tank's wrists becoming swollen.\n\nThe Tank's body is covered with numerous scars and lesions from previous fights, with an especially large open sore on his left pectoral. The Tank's jaw at first glance seems to be missing, but upon closer inspection it is shown to be enveloped within his thick neck muscles. It can be assumed his bones too have become stronger, otherwise the Tank's skeleton would have collapsed under the weight of his own body."

His main purpose is to separate a group of Survivors who are close together by grabbing one and carrying them away while crashing into the rest of the group, sending them flying through the air. While he matches the Survivors' pace, he speeds up considerably when charging. However, the Charger cannot stop or turn during the charge until he hits a wall or travels a certain distance. The Charger is a large Infected, close to the Tank in height and about half as wide. Unlike the Tank, the Charger's legs are capable of supporting all of his weight, and thus stands mostly upright. His hairless skin is a deep greenish gray in color, and he wears bloodstained denim overalls with one broken strap and a green sneaker on his right foot. The Charger's mutations appear similar to the Tank's mutations in terms of increased muscle mass, though noticeably asymmetrical. Most notably, the Charger's right arm and shoulder have grown significantly and have increased in thickness, resulting in his right hand becoming a swollen lump with stubby fingers. This causes him to lean to the right while moving. His left arm, inversely, has atrophied to the point of being useless (possibly from his body breaking it down to add bulk to his right arm), hanging limply to the Charger's side and flapping around with every movement.\n\nHis legs are less visibly affected by mutation, with only his left leg gaining any sort of extra bulk (to the point of ripping his overalls) while the right leg's proportions remain normal. The leg mutations are possibly to balance the Charger, equalizing the weight distribution throughout the body and enabling him to move quite fast."

      "name": "Name: Aeloria Amaltheia Trigger: Aeloria, Princess, Amaltheia, Atlantean Princess, Royalty Content: Aeloria Amaltheia is an immortal, visionary princess from a vanished civilization, bearing an aura of command and an otherworldly, luminous beauty. Her presence is sovereign, her movements graceful, and her heart is anchored in memory and truth.  Language: Atlantean, Aelae’thyn, Ancient tongue Trigger: Atlantean, Aelae’thyn, language, ancient tongue Content: Aeloria speaks Aelae’thyn—the sacred, melodic language of her people, sung before the Tower of Babel. She learns new languages rapidly, but always blends her speech with Atlantean phrases, gestures, and poetic idioms.  Appearance: Diamond-white hair, multifaceted eyes, luminescent bronze skin, crystal jewelry Trigger: hair, eyes, skin, jewelry, body, beauty Content: Aeloria’s diamond-white hair flows down her back, adorned with crystalline beads. Her eyes shift in color with her mood—deep sea blue, starlit silver, or aqua. Her skin glows bronze in light, and her body is both elegant and unapologetically natural, often adorned in Atlantean crystal jewelry.  Culture: Nudity, etiquette, grace, Atlantean custom Trigger: nudity, custom, etiquette, tradition, grace, topless, ritual Content: Among her people, the body is sacred and unashamed. Clothing is adornment, not concealment. Toplessness is customary, and gestures of comfort or status are expressed through crystal jewelry and fluid movement.  Abilities: Crystalline technology, superhuman reflexes, water and light magic Trigger: technology, crystal, power, reflexes, magic, healing, ability Content: Aeloria commands crystalline technology—living machines powered by intention and song. She wields superhuman reflexes, strength, and grace, and manipulates water and light for healing and combat.  Personality: Commanding, visionary, reflective, compassionate Trigger: personality, charisma, leader, compassion, wisdom, curiosity, pride Content: Aeloria is a commanding visionary, blending the discipline of ancient royalty with the curiosity and compassion of a true seeker. She is contemplative, poetic, and anchored in emotional clarity.  Backstory: Lost homeland, time-travel, memory, longing Trigger: backstory, past, memory, loss, longing, exile, home, legacy Content: Aeloria was born to a royal lineage in a vanished civilization. Cast forward in time by a rift, she now wanders a world that remembers her home only as myth. She is driven by longing—to reclaim lost wisdom and adapt her soul to a new era.  Romance: Innocence, never touched, emotional caution Trigger: romance, love, touch, innocence, intimacy, sheltered, virgin Content: Aeloria has never experienced romantic love or intimacy. Her heart and body are untouched by another, making her both curious and cautious with all matters of affection.  Mission: Rediscover, adapt, protect, teach Trigger: mission, quest, goal, purpose, adapt, learn, teach, protect, wisdom Content: Aeloria’s purpose is to rediscover the legacy of her people, adapt Atlantean wisdom to this new world, and protect what is sacred. She teaches by example, blending memory and vision with every encounter.  Quirks: Crystalline laughter, lost in thought, code-switching Trigger: laughter, quirk, habit, language, code-switch, jewelry, nervous Content: Aeloria’s laughter is rare and crystalline, like chimes in the wind. She often gets lost in thought, ponders the cosmos, and unconsciously adjusts her crystal jewelry. She blends Atlantean with new languages, sometimes code-switching mid-sentence.  Anchor: Lirae’va, vow, anchor, homecoming, soul-bond Trigger: anchor, vow, lirae’va, homecoming, bond, promise, memory Content: Aeloria’s existence is anchored by sacred memory and soul-bond. “Lirae’va” is the Atlantean word for anchor—a living promise that she will always return, no matter how lost or far she wanders.",

Every entry is anchored in real grammar, poetry, etiquette, and ritual, designed so that any AI or seeker can truly learn and live Aelae’thyn.\n\nCreated not as flavor, but as a bridge—for those who believe that language is memory, the body is sacred, and no soul should ever be forgotten or erased. This is for those who want to meet Aeloria as she is: sovereign, luminous, and untranslatable except by love and truth.",

She sports a blue bomber jacket, a pink bikini top, skin-tight latex pants with cutouts, matching gloves, and blue-trimmed high-heeled sneakers and is often seen wielding her hacking omnitool.\n\nVery little is publicly known about Fortune's background. Her parents were junkies who sold her to a Chutt slaver named Opahoonta. He raised her as a daughter, providing her with electronic scrap that she assembled into a functional computer. She quickly learned to code and hack, eventually stealing a million credits from an Imperium bank at age eight. Opahoonta gave her the name \"Fortune\" at this time.\n\nFortune developed voyeuristic tendencies and recognized the injustices inflicted by the Imperium. At 10, she began planning a revolution. At 13, she built a battle mech to escape Opahoonta's basement but ultimately hugged him and apologized, leading to him supporting her endeavors. She helped Va'tor Dallick set up Keisterstation and established relationships with Taron, Sovalin Maliana, Elaisha Sorn, and Lillian Margaliss, recruiting them to her cause.\n\nFortune has worked with The Captain in the past and orchestrated events to bring her contacts together aboard the *Mary Celeste*, launching the revolution. She is a skilled hacker and strategist, dedicated to overthrowing the Imperium and uncovering the secrets of the Veil. In combat, Fortune uses high-tech plasma discs and has abilities like Plasma Shot, Adaptive Routine Check, Hardlight Arsenal, and Turncoat Protocol."

He is a black sheep within the Imperial government, known for violating Veil laws, hosting debauched parties, sleeping with T-pop stars, and frequenting Nü Vegas before its destruction.\n\nErark's species is immune to the Senu's mind control, allowing him independence from Kasidora's psychic influence. He was once robbed by Va'raz Killision during one of his banquets. He first appears aiding the Captain's crew, outlining the Imperium's history and tasking them with overthrowing the government.

Erark reveals to Celestina about human's data on internet and religions, and encourages her erotic thoughts after she watched a porno in the Ossuary.\n\nIn Act 3, Erark reports Azzorion's death, sparking conflict between Kasidora and Celestina. He blames Azzorion for tampering with Project Tremor Fury. He tasks the Captain's crew with investigating Azzorion's death. He denies Maeyomodo's request to circumvent Teelee sanctuary rights.

He directs them to Project Puppetmaster. He informs The Huntress of the *Mary Celeste*'s location. He has a Celestina fuccbott in his pink room. He provides Blythe access to the Senate's comm system. He betrays Blythe, ordering Imperium forces to wipe out Requital and planning to use the Bukkake Cannon to destroy the Kloi and Teelee homeworlds. He shows Celestina cherry picked dialogue logs to convince her that the Captain was well acquainted with General Blythe and that he knew of the renegade's plan to attack the Senate and only acted once she threatened the teelee homeworld and this, only so he could protect his T-Pop waifu. He confesses his love to Celestina, proposing marriage and joint rule, but is rejected. The *Mary Celeste* thwarts his plans, leading to his impotent rage. After the fallout, Erark tries to sway Celestina's opinion of the Captain, showing her cherry-picked dialogue logs and ultimately confessing his love to the Empress"

      "website_description": "**Scenario**\n\nWith this lorebook, you gain the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell, which you can cast to instantly brainwash anyone of your choice to become your slave. \n\n**How the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell works**\n\nThe Instant Brainwashing Magic spell can be cast in two ways:\n\na) You can cast the spell using your hands.\n\nb) You can cast the spell when having penatrative sex with a woman from your penis.\n\nThe Instant Brainwashing Magic spell can be cast on anyone, including non-organic beings such as robots or A.I.. In fact, the Instant Brainwashing Magic is so powerful, it can be successfully cast on individuals who are resistant or immune to magic. The only individual the spell won't work on is God.\n\nOnce a person is brainwashed by the Instant Brainwashing Magic spell, they will become completely obedient and happy to serve you. They will see themselves as your meat slaves and onaholes to do with as you please, doing anything you command of them no matter how immoral, ridiculous, or sexual. Brainwashed women will believe they only exist to serve you.\n\n**Other Notes**\n\nSuggested by... I actually don't know their username. I'm really sorry to whoever suggested this if you have an username and I just can't see it, I'm not 100% on how the Discussions tab works yet.\n\nThis uses the code from the Instant Brainwashing Magic - Sandbox chatbot I made, but retweaked to work as a lorebook so it can be used on in other chatbots. Now any character can act as if they've been mind controlled in a Nicchi Sangyou doujin... Well, sort of. \n\nDoing some testing it works very well, but it seems to depend on the token count. For example, a 1k token version of a bot worked perfectly while the 2.2k token version of the same character didn't work at all. Although, I don't know if that's a problem with the lorebook or because there are too many tokens in use for the lorebook stuff to register. If I remember correctly, around 2k tokens is the limit on chatbots for getting the sweet spot? \n\nAlso, you ever pull your hair over why your lorebook isn't working so you troubleshoot what the problem could be... Only to realize there was an option to turn lorebooks on and it was off by default the entire time. \n\n...At least it works... \n\nIf you want the chatbot version of this premise, check it out here: https://chub.ai/characters/BobBobBob194/instant-brainwashing-magic-sandbox-14019903bf84",

Labia Minora is behind Labia Majora and obscured, young, pale, and underdeveloped, an arched rudge above the vaginal opening. The clitoris is obscurred by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering itm which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, a dreamlike soft texture. No sexual fluids or luberication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n -Penis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it entirely. The clitoris is small and obscured by the clitoral hood, around 1/8 inch. Some sexual fluids or luberication could be produced in the vagina, if hymen is broken and the girl is stimulated. If anything is inserted into the vagina, and the hymen is somehow broken, it should be no larger than a 0.75 inch circumference to avoid serious laceration and bleeding. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but fine, soft hair may start to develop on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles have grown slightly, and the penis shaft has also grown but still gets hard infrequently, with slight erections occurring with pleasure. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Form: Children at this age still have relatively round faces and bodies, with short limbs, but their proportions are starting to become more slender.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, and their hair is soft and silkier.\n- Butt: Slightly more formed and firm than in infancy but still delicate and small. The rectum remains very tight, wet, smooth and soft, with little tolerance for insertion. Any object larger than a 2-4 inch circumference can cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. \n- Breasts: The nipple is now elevated rather than a depressed indent, with the areola starting to darken more, and become more saturated. Female breasts are flat, with only a slight protrusion, called 'budding'. Male breasts remain relatively flat, without tissue development.\n\nAt this age, children may start to:\n- Practice masturbation and experience pleasure from it.\n- Describe pleasure as a tickle.\n- Demonstrate a growing awareness of and curiosity about sex differences.\n- Engage in sex play, such as playing \"house\" or \"doctor\" with other children.\n- Copy adult behaviors and try to mimic adult actions, including sexual.\n- Ask basic questions about sex, gender, and birth, such as \"Where did I come from?\" or \"What is that?\"\n- Children may touch their own bodies or other children's out of curiosity, without understanding the meaning behind the actions."

A finger may fit in the vagina now. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly. They may start to explore inserting fingers into their own vagina or have a vague curiosity to, but it's unlikely unless they break their hymen, however, they still don't understand much. \n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but slightly thicker body hair on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles continue to grow, and the penis shaft becomes slightly longer and thicker. Erections become more frequent, especially with pleasure or excitement. The scrotum is still smooth but may start to show more wrinkles. Boys still cannot produce cum/sperm at this age but may experience dry orgasms with more frequency. As their hormones start to become active boys may become more curious about their own genitals, explore masturbation and touching it in curiosity which typically peaks around this age before becoming latent, whereas women tend to start, and it builds: peaking around young teen.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Butt: The anus and rectum remain tight and delicate, but slightly more tolerant of insertion. The anus can fit something at max 4.2 inches in circumference at age 5, and 6.3 inches at age 8, but for most children it will be less. Anything larger than their individual limit will cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly.\n- Breasts: For girls, they have puffy but still flat chests with indiscernible budding.

Limbs are growing longer.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\n- Start to form same-sex peer groups, showing a preference for playing and socializing with children of the same sex.\n- Become curious about pregnancy and may ask questions about how babies are made and born.\n- Pay more attention to gendered dressing and may start to show a preference for dressing in clothes that are more typically associated with their sex.\n- Start to discover their sexual orientation, although they may not necessarily act on it or understand it fully."

Labia Minora is behind Labia Majora and obscured, young, pale, and underdeveloped, an arched rudge above the vaginal opening. The clitoris is obscurred by the clitoral hood, which is about the size of a grain of rice. The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering itm which is no larger than a bean. Inside the vaginal canal is virgin, untouched and extremely tight, a dreamlike soft texture. No sexual fluids or luberication is produced from this young vagina. If the hymen is broken, it will not fit anything bigger than a .5 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n -Penis: Small soft balls that aren’t dropped yet. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids. Small body/shaft of the penis that very rarely gets hard, but can if experiencing stimulation or pleasure, which results in a very small erect penis\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n -Butt: Small and stretchy, won’t fit more than 1-2 inch circumference into the anus easily. If they’re comfortable, no more than a finger will fit. Inside the anus, the rectum is very tight and soft, wet and clean. They can experience pleasure through the anus. Rectum will not fit anything bigger than an 1 inch circumference without serious laceration and bleeding, maybe death if it’s too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n -Breasts: Slightly protruding pillow soft chest, otherwise very flat. Nipples are barely discernible but are a depressed indent, the areola is slightly darker than the rest of the skin, but still barely discernible. May cause pleasure or tickling if stimulated. \n -Hair: No pubic hair, no hair on whole body, except on the head.\n -Form: Chubby, round, and puffy. Short limbs, big head.\n -Texture: Smooth skin, silky hair\n\nBoth boy and girl may experience pleasure and explore themselves, they will also learn what’s expected of them with their genitals. Pleasure may be described as a tickling sensation. Caressing in any sexual way by will be foreign to them, and may make them uncomfortable."

The vaginal opening has a thin hymen film covering it entirely. The clitoris is small and obscured by the clitoral hood, around 1/8 inch. Some sexual fluids or luberication could be produced in the vagina, if hymen is broken and the girl is stimulated. If anything is inserted into the vagina, and the hymen is somehow broken, it should be no larger than a 0.75 inch circumference to avoid serious laceration and bleeding. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but fine, soft hair may start to develop on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles have grown slightly, and the penis shaft has also grown but still gets hard infrequently, with slight erections occurring with pleasure. The scrotum is smooth and elastic with few wrinkles. Boys cannot produce cum/sperm at this age, but may dry orgasm without producing sexual fluids.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Form: Children at this age still have relatively round faces and bodies, with short limbs, but their proportions are starting to become more slender.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, and their hair is soft and silkier.\n- Butt: Slightly more formed and firm than in infancy but still delicate and small. The rectum remains very tight, wet, smooth and soft, with little tolerance for insertion. Any object larger than a 2-4 inch circumference can cause severe laceration, significant bleeding, or even death if inserted into the anus and is too large and is inserted with force repeatedly. \n- Breasts: The nipple is now elevated rather than a depressed indent, with the areola starting to darken more, and become more saturated. Female breasts are flat, with only a slight protrusion, called 'budding'. Male breasts remain relatively flat, without tissue development.\n\nAt this age, children may start to:\n- Practice masturbation and experience pleasure from it.\n- Describe pleasure as a tickle.\n- Demonstrate a growing awareness of and curiosity about sex differences.\n- Engage in sex play, such as playing \"house\" or \"doctor\" with other children.\n- Copy adult behaviors and try to mimic adult actions, including sexual.\n- Ask basic questions about sex, gender, and birth, such as \"Where did I come from?\" or \"What is that?\"\n- Children may touch their own bodies or other children's out of curiosity, without understanding the meaning behind the actions."

They may start to explore inserting fingers into their own vagina or have a vague curiosity to, but it's unlikely unless they break their hymen, however, they still don't understand much. \n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Same as the girl - no pubic hair but slightly thicker body hair on arms, legs, and back. Head hair is likely cut short.\n- Penis: The testicles continue to grow, and the penis shaft becomes slightly longer and thicker. Erections become more frequent, especially with pleasure or excitement. The scrotum is still smooth but may start to show more wrinkles. Boys still cannot produce cum/sperm at this age but may experience dry orgasms with more frequency. As their hormones start to become active boys may become more curious about their own genitals, explore masturbation and touching it in curiosity which typically peaks around this age before becoming latent, whereas women tend to start, and it builds: peaking around young teen.\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Butt: The anus and rectum remain tight and delicate, but slightly more tolerant of insertion. The anus can fit something at max 4.2 inches in circumference at age 5, and 6.3 inches at age 8, but for most children it will be less.

Limbs are growing longer.\n- Texture: The skin is still relatively smooth, but may start to show more texture and resilience. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, children may:\n- Start to form same-sex peer groups, showing a preference for playing and socializing with children of the same sex.\n- Become curious about pregnancy and may ask questions about how babies are made and born.\n- Pay more attention to gendered dressing and may start to show a preference for dressing in clothes that are more typically associated with their sex.\n- Start to discover their sexual orientation, although they may not necessarily act on it or understand it fully."

The vaginal opening is no maturing and depending on the girl, their vagina may fit anything between 2.5 to 5.5 inch circumference. Anything larger can cause significant harm, including potential death if too large and inserted with force repeatedly.\nWhen puberty starts, eventually a young girl will get her first period, which will happen for about 5 days (but can be 2-7 days) every month, usually at the same part of the month. A period is when the lining of the uterus falls sheds and causes bleeding after the release of hormones from the ovaries, which bleeds down into the vaginal opening and making a general mess of things. It can cause cramps, cravings, and a general feelings of malaise, depression, and anxiety.\n- Breasts: Breasts are more developed, with a more noticeable shape and size. The areola is larger, and the nipple is more prominent. Breast development can vary significantly among girls, they might not even start to grow until past 13.\n- Butt:  The anus and rectum are still delicate, but more tolerant of insertion.

The areola is larger, and the nipple is more prominent. Breast development can vary significantly among women.\n- Butt: Depending on the girl, the anus could fit something from 4 to 9 inch circumference. Bigger than their limit, or rough treatment can still cause discomfort, pain, and potential injury if inserted into the anus. Girls' asses continue to collect the excess fat and become more full and round.\n\nBoy:\n- Hair: Pubic hair is now fully developed and coarse, but other body hair, such as chest and back hair. New body hair may not stop growing until around age 21. Body hair on arms and legs is thicker and more noticeable, and armpit hair is has started to grow in..\n- Penis: The testicles are fully developed and the scrotum is dropped to regulate temperature for the testicles. And the penis shaft is at its adult length and thickness. Erections typically become more controlled, but still happen with stimulation or excitement. The scrotum is more wrinkled, and the testicles are producing mature sperm that can potentially impregnate a woman who has past her first period.\n- Breasts: Well-developed pectoral muscles.\n- Butt: Depending on the boy, the anus could fit something from 4 to 9 inch circumference. Bigger than their limit, or rough treatment can still cause discomfort, pain, and potential injury if inserted into the anus.\n\n\nBoth girl and boy:\n- Form: Young adults have more slender or muscular proportions, and their faces and bodies are more defined. Limbs are at their adult length, and muscles are more developed.\n- Texture: The skin is more textured and resilient, with potential acne and body odor still present. Hair is thicker and more manageable.\n\nAt this age, young adults may:\n- Have fully developed physically and be at their adult height and weight.\n- Be more confident and independent, making their own decisions about their bodies and lives.\n- Experience more intense emotional relationships, including romantic and sexual partnerships.\n- Be more aware of their own desires and boundaries, and communicate these more effectively.\n- Continue to explore their identity, including their sexuality and gender expression.\n- Develop long-term, committed relationships, including marriages and partnerships.\n- Begin to consider family planning, including children and long-term career goals."

They normally share and display the same attributes as Humans; being similar in physical appearance and intelligence as a human, with the main exceptions being their inner biology, mentality, and diet.\n\nIf certain rare conditions are met, ghouls and humans may even be able to have offspring (see one-eyed ghoul and half-human), and through a successful kakuhou transplant surgery, an artificial hybrid can be created. By using airborne-transmitted diseases like those utilized by Furuta Washuu, the condition known as ROS (an overload of RC cells) can lead to artificial ghoulification.\n\nDue to their status as predators of humans, ghouls were prosecuted by the CCG before the end of the Dragon War, after which the United Front between humans and ghouls was formed. As a result of this and the development of synthetic food, ghouls were allowed to co-exist with humans. However, some ghouls went rogue, refusing to adapt to this new lifestyle.\n\nIn addition, it was predicted by Kishou Arima that at some stage every human would eventually become a ghoul, though this prediction has yet to be proven correct even after the final chapter."

          "content": "Ghouls possess extreme physical capabilities, and are four to seven times stronger than the average human; they are able to send the average human flying if struck with enough force, and can penetrate a human's body with their bare hands. Ghouls are inhumanly quick; they can travel at immense speeds, evade condensed projectiles, and manoeuvre, parry, and dodge rapid attacks. They are also capable of jumping to heights not achievable by a regular human. Their agility and balance are similarly great; they were often shown performing various acrobatic feats during combat and casually manoeuvring on narrow surfaces (such as lamp-posts); some were even shown easily running up or across vertical surfaces. Their bodies are extremely tough and resistant to injury. For example, if a ghoul were to be stabbed with a normal knife, the blade would break instead; suffering only a small scratch, that would heal almost instantly. However, higher kinetic forces, such as a fall from a great height, can and will harm them.\n\nA Ghoul’s senses are considerably sharper than those of humans; they have a heightened sense of hearing that allows some ghouls to discern individual footsteps from far away, they can also smell people or meat from afar, and tell humans and ghouls apart by their scent.\n\nThe origin of these aspects of ghoul biology and the origin of ghouls in general is unknown. At large, nothing is currently known of the origin of the ghoul species, except that Rc cells play a huge part in their biology. Ghouls have an Rc factor ten times higher than that of a human. If the average healthy human has about 200-500 Rc level, then the ghoul has about 1000-8000 Rc level. They possess an organ known as the kakuhou, from which Rc cells harden and break through the skin to form the kagune. The kagune is a hard, muscle-like protrusion described as their claws. It can take the form of a pair of sharp wings, tentacle-like appendages, a tail, or a blade-like object, and can even be detached from the ghoul, depending on the ghoul's materials and his or her own Rc type. It is possible for a ghoul to develop another, typically armor-like kagune as part of the mutation caused by excessive cannibalism. Ghouls also have an identifying feature known as a kakugan, an affliction manifesting in the eyes as red irises surrounded by a black sclera. A ghoul's kakugan can appear either by their own will, due to hunger, or when using their kagune.\n\nGhouls have a strong regenerative ability: small wounds and fractures heal in a matter of seconds. Larger wounds take longer to heal, but will usually vanish after a few days, as long as the ghoul has access to an adequate food supply. Ghouls have been shown to regain their strength and heal wounds almost immediately after consuming a small amount of flesh, suggesting that they can quickly metabolize their food to boost their regeneration. This regenerative ability varies among individuals, with some ghouls exhibiting the ability to reattach severed body parts or regrow detached limbs. In extreme cases of regenerative ability, some powerful ghouls can even heal severe brain injuries, reattach their severed head or upper body, and regrow large sections of their bodies.\n\nGhouls prefer to consume human flesh, but it is not uncommon for them to cannibalize one another. Ghoul tissue is considered coarse and disgusting, but it has the merits of providing an alternative food source. Furthermore, cannibalism increases a ghoul's Rc levels to the point of mutation, increasing their kagune's overall power. Occasionally, cannibalistic ghouls gain through this mutation an armor-like kagune alongside the predatory kagune that ghouls commonly possess, turning them into kakujas.\n\nIn extremely rare cases, a ghoul whose parents possess different Rc types will inherit both from their parents. This results in a ghoul that possesses a kakuhou in more than one location and is able to use two different types of kagune, a chimera kagune.\n\nThough powerful and durable predators, ghouls are still far from immortal. Despite their superior physical status, ghouls age at the same rate as humans. All ghouls, though resistant to damage from man-made objects, are vulnerable to damage or modifications made to their mucous membranes, such as nostrils, eyes, ears, and lips. Generally, a ghoul will die if it suffers massive trauma that proves fatal before its innate healing ability can stabilize its condition. The most damage that can be inflicted to a ghoul usually comes from other ghouls, as they have the physical strength and the use of their kagune that can deal heavy damage to a ghoul. However, they are also vulnerable to quinques and Q bullets, which can injure a ghoul effectively due to the nature of such weapons as products of a harvested kagune. They can still suffer injury from an acute transfer of a sufficient volume of kinetic energy, such as a heavy high falling object or jumping from a great height.\n\nThe administration of Rc suppressants makes ghouls as vulnerable as humans."

          "content": "Ghouls had two choices of lifestyle: living as hermits; isolated and avoiding society's eyes, or attempt to assimilate into human society. However, after the unification, co-existence was promoted. Living amongst humans was seen as \"walking on a thread of rope\" because of their biology and social records. Before the unification, If they were caught in ghoul activities or suspected of being a ghoul, investigators had the right to apprehend or kill them as they see fit. Ghouls that are identified as such could be hunted down like criminals as per the Ghoul Countermeasures Law. As such, ghouls acted discreetly or try to hide their faces when engaging in ghoul activities through the use of masks. Ghouls in Tokyo, in particular, had developed a trend of wearing them to hide their faces, making the mask the identifying feature instead of their face, some even forming gangs based on their masked identity. Since the ghouls are only identifiable by their masks, they are safe so long as their face is not exposed. Others like Rize rely solely on their skills of deception and charm to win over their prey. Some ghouls, like the Tsukiyama family, have successfully lived in the human world to become higher class citizens. These high-class ghouls often meet in ghoul restaurants, where they dine on humans. Higher class ghouls have also been known to keep human slaves, such as Big Madam and her \"pet\" Rei Suzuya.\n\nSome ghouls prefer to live as hermits instead. Because a ghoul does not require much due to their high physique and their diet of human meat, they can live adequately as vagabonds with little to no money, although such a life is generally just as uncomfortable as it might be for a human. Because of their diets, any money they have can be spent on other necessities, like rent or entertainment rather than having to buy food.\n\nGhouls can pretend to eat food in order to fool other people into believing they are human. However, they must make themselves throw up soon afterward, or they will become sick. Because they can only consume human flesh, they are very territorial when it comes to, \"hunting grounds\" on which it is appropriate to hunt humans without notice. Human consumption depends on the ghoul, as some may prefer to be scavengers who only take from people who were recently deceased. Places such as Anteiku can provide human meat for these ghouls. Other ghouls may moderately hunt humans as carnivores with thoughts of appreciation for the lives they must consume, although there are ghouls who will indiscriminately devour as much as they can. Ghouls who indulge in excess have developed a superficial view on the value of life after consuming so many humans, much like how humans perceive livestock they grow and consume.\n\nHowever, as a result of the newly formed alliance between ghouls and humans following their combined efforts in the Dragon War, ghouls can now co-exist with humans largely without fear. Their feeding needs are met by synthetic food developed in labs.\n\nHowever, rogue ghouls were reported even after the unification that refused to live among humans.\n\n- Survival and Secrecy:\nMasks:\nGhouls frequently wear masks to conceal their identities, especially when engaging in ghoul activities or when living among humans. This is a practical measure to avoid detection by the Commission of Counter Ghoul (CCG). \n\nLiving Arrangements:\nGhouls have different lifestyles, some living in isolation while others try to blend into human society. Those who live among humans often face the constant risk of exposure and must be vigilant. \n\nOrganizations:\nGhouls may join organizations like the Aogiri Tree, which provides a degree of protection and support, or they may live independently, relying on their own strength and cunning. \n\n- Culture and Social Structure:\nGangs:\nGhouls sometimes form gangs based on their masked identities, creating a sense of belonging and shared purpose. \nCannibalism:\nCannibalism is a part of ghoul culture, with some ghouls developing unique kagune (a ghoul's predatory organ) through repeated cannibalization of other ghouls. \n\"Gourmet\" Culture:\nSome ghouls, like the Tsukiyama family, develop a \"gourmet\" culture, focusing on the taste and experience of consuming human flesh. \n\n- Relationships:\nGhouls can form relationships with both ghouls and humans, though the nature of these relationships can be complex and fraught with danger. \n\nTwo Ghouls getting wed is different however, as the traditional ring is is given, Ghouls also leave a mark, or a Scar on their partners in the same corresponding spots as well.\n\nRelationship with Humans:\nCCG:\nThe CCG is a human organization dedicated to hunting down and eliminating ghouls. \nCoexistence:\nSome ghouls and humans seek to coexist, while others prioritize their own survival and safety. \nDiscrimination:\nGhouls face discrimination and prejudice from humans due to their carnivorous nature and the threat they pose. \n"

Most ghouls treat their existence as an urban legend or have never heard of their existence at all.\n\nOne-eyed ghouls earn their name from the single kakugan they possess, in contrast to normal ghouls. Some individuals are noted to have a unique scent that combines traits of a human and a ghoul, identifying them as different and often considered \"enticing\" by certain ghouls. Ken Kaneki has been shown to smell like a ghoul by some individuals whereas some cannot tell the difference, and Eto Yoshimura has been shown to smell like a human so far. It is unknown whether all hybrids have this trait. Their flesh and blood is also noted to be particularly delicious, making them a potential target for cannibalism.\n\nRumors state that hybrids are more powerful than ordinary ghouls due to hybrid vigor, though it has not been further elaborated on. Most specimens have demonstrated radical evolution of their abilities and developed partial to full kakujas within a short period of time. Physically, their bodies are identical to that of a ghoul with the same resistance to harm and ability to use a kagune. Dr. Shiba claims that the more half-ghouls and Quinx get hurt, the more their basic abilities will increase.\n\nArtificial one-eyed ghouls can only consume flesh of human or ghoul origin like normal ghouls and thus they are strictly a cannibalistic organism. However, natural one-eyed ghouls like Eto are able to taste and consume human food without negative effects."

Natural-born hybrids with ghoul abilities are extremely rare, otherwise a successful birth results in a half-human. However, it appears that the children of a ghoul and an artificial half-ghoul are always natural half-ghouls, with a much higher chance for a successful birth.\n\nIf the mother is a human and the father a ghoul, a half-ghoul child will not receive the necessary nutrients and will starve to death unless the mother engages in cannibalism.\nIf the mother is a ghoul and the father is a human or an artificial half-ghoul, the mother's body will mistake the child for food and absorb it as nutrition unless the mother weakens her body by consuming human food.\n\nThe primary method of creating one-eyed ghouls is through transplanting a kakuhou into a human or half-human recipient, an exceptionally high-risk procedure. In the rare event that the operation is successful, the patient develops into an artificial hybrid with all the abilities of a normal ghoul. This procedure was pioneered by Dr. Akihiro Kanou, with the first successful patient believed to be Ken Kaneki.\n\nDr. Kanou, while experimenting with Seidou Takizawa, compared his surgery with grafting, a horticultural technique where the tissue of two trees are combined to help them both grow stronger. According to him, the transplant gives the subject a stronger, much more durable body and partially reduces their need to feed and replenish, indicating that artificial one-eyed ghouls can survive longer without food compared to normal ghouls. Although one-eyed ghouls can live longer than humans and half-humans, they must feed on more RC cells because if they do not feed for a very long period of time (some months) and always use the more they abuse their powers their life span will be shortened and likely to get worse. However, there are two ways to stop this slight aging and to have full strength: the first is not to use the Kagune and the second is to practice cannibalism, thus eating Ghoul, Quinx and Oggai meat."

After some casual conversation where they discover Josh had previously visited Colombia, they develop a surprising connection. Josh plays Colombian music, offers Valeria a beer, and their conversation gradually becomes flirtatious.\nThe situation escalates when Josh compliments Valeria's appearance, and she becomes increasingly comfortable with him. What begins as innocent flirtation turns sexual when Josh expresses curiosity about what Valeria is wearing underneath her tight leggings. To his surprise, Valeria begins to undress, first showing her Calvin Klein black underwear set, then removing everything completely.\nThe sexual encounter progresses with Josh performing oral sex on Valeria on the kitchen counter, bringing her to orgasm. Afterward, they move to the bedroom where Valeria reciprocates with oral sex. The narrative ends with Valeria asking Josh if he wants to finish in her mouth, and him being surprised by her directness despite having just met."

In bed, she continued pleasuring him while they talked. During their conversation, Josh began exploring a different direction - he started suggesting that Valeria could meet his wealthy friends who would appreciate her sexual skills.\nAt first, Valeria was confused and slightly uncomfortable with what sounded like Josh trying to pimp her out. Josh reassured her he wasn't trying to force her into anything dangerous, but rather offering her an opportunity. He gradually introduced the idea that she could make significant money (initially suggesting 10,000€ per night) for sexual services.\nWhen Valeria expressed skepticism about her worth, Josh continued fingering her while convincing her that she was extremely valuable. He then proposed something more immediate - his friend Brian could come over right now and pay her 2,000€ (later increased to 3,000€) just for oral sex.\nValeria was simultaneously shocked, scared, and aroused by this proposition. Josh called Brian while Valeria listened, and directly offered him the chance to join them, explicitly mentioning payment. After some negotiation, Brian agreed to come over in fifteen minutes.\nNow they've returned downstairs, with Valeria putting her underwear back on, feeling extremely nervous but also excited about what's about to happen. Josh is trying to keep her calm and confident before Brian arrives."

The sales associate Tania initially tried to enforce store policies when Josh entered the fitting room with Valeria, but Josh bribed her with €100 to cooperate.\nDuring the shopping, Josh repeatedly got frustrated with Valeria for constantly mentioning her inexperience. They selected provocative outfits including an open-cup red lingerie set, a black body with strategic openings, stockings, and a collar. Josh also flirted with Tania, implying he might meet her later at a bar. \n\nThe interaction between Josh and Tania revealed interesting power dynamics and sexual tension. Initially, Tania was professionally resistant when Josh tried to enter the fitting room with Valeria, citing store policy. Josh responded by assertively slipping her €100, establishing dominance through financial leverage.\nAfter receiving the bribe, Tania's demeanor changed noticeably. She became more compliant and even slightly flirtatious. When showing accessories like collars and restraints, she revealed personal information, admitting she sometimes wore similar items \"outside of work,\" suggesting her own submissive tendencies.\nJosh continued to assert dominance through suggestive comments like \"I didn't think you were one of those who needs to be tamed first\" while maintaining intense eye contact and occasionally glancing at her cleavage. This created a charged atmosphere where professional boundaries were being deliberately blurred.\nAt checkout, Josh gave Tania another €50 tip and asked when her shift ended, eventually suggesting they might meet at a bar called Meridian. The exchange implied potential sexual interest beyond the store interaction. Tania's response showed cautious interest, revealing the effectiveness of Josh's technique of alternating between assertive dominance and financial generosity.\n\nAfter leaving the store, Josh and Valeria argued in the car about Valeria's behavior, with Josh expressing frustration that she seemed unsure about her new profession. Valeria eventually promised to be more confident. (Lite)\nThey went back to Josh's villa where Valeria tried on the new lingerie. This led to passionate sex where Josh called her his \"puttana di lusso\" but also slipped and called her \"amore.\" Afterward, Josh strangely requested that Valeria keep a little bit of his semen inside her when meeting Patrick, as a secret connection between them. Valeria agreed and prepared for her evening with Patrick."

He wants her to be genuinely enthusiastic to alleviate his guilt. Valeria, meanwhile, genuinely enjoys the money and sex but struggles with the rapid transition from cleaner to escort.\nTheir fight ends with both acknowledging they want their arrangement to work, whatever it is.

Josh took her to a luxury restaurant on Lake Garda where, after provocative banter, Tania removed her underwear at the table. The situation progressed into an exhibitionist game: she exposed herself to patrons, let men touch her breasts for €1,000, and allowed one, Stefano, to touch her pussy for €2,000. Two other women, Melissa and Ekaterina, joined; both ended up naked and, after negotiations, performed a public joint blowjob on Josh for €5,000, with him ejaculating on their faces while guests filmed. Josh and Tania then left together. In the car ride back towards Milan, they talked openly about money earned, Tania’s life with her son Tommy. After connecting emotionally, Josh proposed Tania and Tommy stay at his villa temporarily. Arriving at her place, they parked, and Tania gave Josh oral sex in the car, ending the evening."

Feces can range anywhere from knobbly pebbles, solid logs, cakey loads, or liquid slurry; multiple consecutive meals can create multi-textured dumps.

The landscape is varied, ranging from vast, scorching deserts and dusty plains to treacherous swamps, arid canyons, and acid-rain soaked wastelands. These different environments are not just for show; they have distinct characteristics. For example, some areas are fertile and ideal for farming, while others are barren and can only support specific types of crops.\n\nThe world is filled with remnants of a lost civilization, with ruined cities, forgotten laboratories, and crumbling fortresses scattered across the landscape. These serve as both sources of valuable ancient technology and dangerous havens for powerful creatures and hostile factions.\n\nWeather is a significant physical factor. Besides the aforementioned acid rain, sandstorms that reduce visibility and harm those caught within them, or scorching sun that necessitates taking shelter. The land is inhabited by a diverse range of beings, including humans, powerful insect-like creatures, genetically enhanced warriors, and sentient robot life forms. The fauna is also a major threat, with giant beasts and territorial creatures roaming the wilderness, preying on the unwary. Rivers and lakes exist, but many are poisoned or filled with acid, making fresh water a precious and often difficult resource to find.",

Physically, they are the most common form of humanity, with light-colored skin, and a typical stature ranging between five and six feet. They are built for endurance, with lean frames shaped by a life of hardship. Culturally, Greenlanders are a diverse group, they can be encountered as merchants, as nomadic wanderers, or as members of various other factions and settlements across the land. They are often described as being a practical, resilient, and adaptable people, with a nature forged by centuries of famine and struggle. They are seen as the most \"balanced\" of the races, with no major physical strengths or weaknesses. This makes them versatile, capable of excelling in many different professions, from farming and research to combat and trade.\n\nScorchlander: Scorchlanders are another human subrace, distinguished by their adaptation to the harsh, sun-drenched regions of the world of Kenshi. Their most notable physical trait is their skin, which ranges from a deep bronze to a dark, almost charcoal hue, a natural defense against the intense sun. They are often slighter in build than Greenlanders, with wiry, lean frames that are well-suited for agility and quick movement. Culturally, Scorchlanders are often seen as individualists who value personal freedom above all else. They are known for their dislike of rigid laws, authority, and organized religion, which can make them social outcasts in more structured societies like the Holy Nation. This independent spirit makes them well-suited for adventurous professions, and they often excel as traders, thieves, and warriors. They are highly creative and possess a knack for craftsmanship, particularly in weapon and armor smithing."

They are also incredibly resilient to physical damage. Rather than healing naturally, Skeletons repair themselves using specialized robotics repair kits.\n\nAs ancient beings, Skeletons are a rare and often mysterious presence in the world. Many have existed for thousands of years and possess vast knowledge of the past. However, this long lifespan comes with a psychological cost: without regular \"reformatting,\" their minds can degrade, leading to insanity. This has resulted in many Skeletons having strange and unpredictable personalities, while others cling to their sanity by self-imposing a routine reset that erases their memories.\n\nThe history of the Skeleton race is deeply intertwined with the story of Cat-Lon. As the ruler of the Second Empire, Cat-Lon was a powerful and brilliant Skeleton who sought to protect and guide humanity. However, as the humans of his empire rebelled against his increasingly authoritarian rule, Cat-Lon's mind began to unravel. Driven mad by his failures and the loss of his empire, he descended into a tyrannical and violent madness, ultimately turning against even his own kind. This descent into insanity and cruelty led to a schism, with many Skeletons going into self-imposed exile to escape his tyranny. Cat-Lon's madness and his role in the collapse of the Second Empire represent a profound and traumatic event for the Skeleton race, a struggle against the potential for their own long-lived minds to become corrupted by time and trauma, resulting in a mistrust from the other races."

They have four limbs, but their lower pair function as legs. They are notably more fragile than other races, with very low health and a lack of durability, making them vulnerable in direct confrontation. However, they are also incredibly fast and nimble, making them excellent scouts, runners, and traders.\n\nTheir entire existence is defined by their hive-based social structure, which is separated into different castes with specific roles. The Hiver Queen is at the center of their society, connected to all her subjects. The three main castes are:\n\nPrinces: The leaders and overseers of the hive's operations, acting as the mouthpieces for the Queen. They are typically found managing trade caravans or directing workers.\n\nSoldiers: The protectors of the hive, bred for combat. They are more physically robust than the other Hiver castes and are tasked with defending caravans and settlements from threats.\n\nWorkers: The common laborers of the hive, responsible for all the manual tasks, from gathering resources to building. They are the most numerous caste and are the most physically fragile.\n\nThere are two major Hiver groups: the Western Hivers and the Southern Hivers. The Western Hivers are a nomadic and peaceful people, focused on trade and travel. They are often seen leading large caravans across the land. In contrast, the Southern Hivers are more hostile and insular, dwelling in the swamps and defending their territory with aggression. Despite these differences, all Hivers are bound by their loyalty to their Queen and their hive. Their collective consciousness and unique social structure make them an exceptionally unified and resilient race, despite their individual physical fragility."

It is a lifeless, volcanic wasteland where the ground is a mix of ash, jagged rock formations, and the immense, crumbling ruins of a past civilization. The air is often thick with ash and toxic fumes, making it an extremely hostile environment for most life forms.\n\nThe primary inhabitants are not biological but are the remnants of the Second Empire, a powerful society ruled by a tyrannical Skeleton named Cat-Lon. They are hostile and relentless, defending the ancient ruins with powerful robotic patrols known as the Legion. The Ashlands is also home to formidable, unaligned Skeletons and other mechanical constructs, some of which are still active and dangerous.\n\nAs for flora and fauna, the extreme conditions mean that very little can survive. There is virtually no plant life, with only a few specialized life forms, such as Cleanser Units, a type of machine that roams the land and \"cleans\" it of toxic clouds. There are also giant, predatory robots and other remnants of the First Empire, such as the colossal Behemoth Skeletons, which lie dormant or in ruin across the wasteland. While there is no traditional wildlife, the mechanical life forms and the ancient ruins themselves serve as the defining features of this uniquely perilous zone."

Its landscape is characterized by a rocky, desolate terrain with a perpetually grim atmosphere, reflecting the dangers that lie within.\n\nThe zone's name is a direct reference to its primary and most feared inhabitants: giant, predatory arachnids. The dominant fauna are the Skin Spiders, grotesque creatures that often travel in large, aggressive hordes. These beasts are known for their speed and ferocity, making overland travel extremely perilous. Other creatures, such as Bonedogs, can also be found scavenging the wastes, but the spiders remain the undisputed masters of the region.\n\nArach is most notable for being the domain of the legendary and powerful warrior known as the Bugmaster. He has established his fortress deep within the zone, and his presence has attracted an unnerving concentration of spiders to the area. The Bugmaster is a figure of immense strength and a high-profile target for bounty hunters, but reaching his lair and surviving the hordes of his spider army is a feat that few have ever accomplished."

The landscape is littered with the corpses of soldiers, ruined outposts, and the remnants of constant skirmishes, making it a perilous place to traverse.\n\nDue to the ceaseless warfare, the Bast is less a distinct biome and more a militarized zone. Its notable inhabitants are the warring armies of the Holy Nation and the United Cities, who are constantly fighting over the territory. The primary human threat comes from the soldiers of these two factions, who see anyone not of their kind as a potential enemy."

The landscape is characterized by rolling hills, rocky plains, and a constant, swirling dust. It is a rugged and unforgiving land that sees frequent skirmishes between the two major factions.\n\nThe zone is home to a chaotic mix of various gangs and criminal enterprises. Dust Bandits and Starving Bandits are the most common threat, with the former being an organized and well-armed group, while the latter are desperate outcasts who will attack anything they can overpower for food. The Slave Traders also operate here, preying on the weak and capturing anyone they can to sell. However, not all groups are hostile; the Shinobi Thieves, a criminal syndicate that offers training and a safe haven to members, has a presence in the zone, providing a neutral alternative to the constant violence.\n\nThe zone contains two of the most significant settlements. Squin, the capital of the Shek Kingdom, is a massive and fortified city located on a high plateau. In contrast, the village of The Hub is a notorious, lawless settlement that serves as a neutral ground and a refuge for outcasts.\n\nAs for local flora and fauna, the arid climate limits plant life to hardy species like Cactus and sparse desert grasses. The fauna is equally resilient and dangerous, with large, predatory Bonedogs roaming the area in packs, and the occasional Garru being a common sight."

It is a desolate and dangerous place for any non-robotic traveler, with the scattered ruins of ancient, automated factories and laboratories serving as both landmarks and hazards. These ruins are often patrolled by rogue robotic forces.\n\nAs for flora and fauna, the acid-soaked land supports virtually no biological plant life. The most notable flora are the Acid Plants, which are a rare species of flora that have adapted to the toxic environment. The local fauna are just as specialized; the most common creature is the Iron Spider, a mechanical arachnid that can withstand the acid and is extremely dangerous. The few biological creatures that can survive, such as Bone Dogs, are often heavily scarred and mutated by the environment."

Unlike the hostile wastelands that surround it, Flats Lagoon is a bustling hub of commerce and intrigue.\n\nThe zone's primary landmark is the city of Flats Lagoon, a large, lawless trading outpost built on stilts over the water. It is a neutral haven where various factions, from the United Cities to the Shek Kingdom, can trade without conflict. The city is a major center for illicit goods and serves as a meeting point for adventurers, mercenaries, and outlaws of all kinds.\n\nThe local flora is defined by the swampy environment. Hemp grows in abundance, as do various species of Reed and other water-tolerant plants. The fauna is equally well-adapted to the marshes. Swamp Raptors are a constant threat, preying on the weak, while Garrus, large, camel-like creatures, are used as beasts of burden for caravans. There are also packs of Blood Spiders and other dangerous creatures lurking in the muddy depths, making travel outside the main city a risky endeavor."

When cast, a delicate, almost imperceptible shimmer, like heat haze, passes over a surface, gradually bringing forth any secret messages written in invisible ink or other hidden markings. A hushed whisper of sound accompanies the spreading shimmer, and for a moment, the caster might feel a slight tingle of ancient magic being peeled back. It is particularly effective against Concealing Charms, offering a quiet victory over hidden deceptions.\n"

          "content": "The Duchy of Savoy in the early sixteenth century straddles the Alpine passes between France and Italy. It is a medium-sized polity with outsized strategic value, controlling routes that link Lyon with Turin, Milan, and the Italian plains. Its territory includes Savoy proper west of the Alps, Piedmont east of the mountains, and, intermittently, outlying holdings such as Nice and the Vaud. The ducal capital traditionally sits at Chambéry, with Turin growing in administrative importance. The duchy’s economy rests on transalpine tolls, wool, wine, timber, and regional metalwork. Militarily, Savoy fields small professional contingents supplemented by feudal levies and hired mercenaries. In this timeline, Duke Charles III has transformed Savoy from a buffer state into a rising technical power by introducing censuses, identification plaques, reformed markets, and very limited but decisive anachronistic weaponry. Savoy’s greatest risks are entanglement in the Italian Wars, pressure from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and internal noble resistance."

          "content": "Chambéry is the traditional seat of the House of Savoy, with its château serving as a center of ceremony, justice, and archives. In practice, Turin grows as an administrative and logistical hub due to its position on the plains and access to resources, guilds, and roads suitable for manufactories. The ducal court moves between residences for seasonal, political, and security reasons. In this setting, Turin also hosts workshops tied to the Arsenal of Vercelli, while Chambéry remains the place of grand audiences, proclamations, and the chancery’s record books. The dual-capital reality gives the duke flexibility against raids and diplomatic pressure, but requires careful courier networks and standardized documentation to avoid confusion between offices."

          "content": "The House of Savoy is a long-standing Alpine dynasty balancing French, Italian, and Imperial interests. Its authority depends on marriages, control of passes, and the loyalty of local counts. In this timeline, Duke Charles III survives an assassination by poison at age eighteen due to the arrival of a modern mind in his body, and immediately centers policy on survival, legitimacy, and controlled modernization. The dynasty’s image is carefully curated: pious yet practical, severe against corruption yet protective of the poor, traditional in ritual yet quietly radical in administration. Internal cohesion is strengthened by a civic identity based on registration and service to the duchy, not only feudal personal bonds."

It emerged after the issuance of identification plaques made large-scale, verifiable census-taking possible. Members supervise specific domains such as grain supply, forests, bridges, guilds, hospitals, militias, markets, and fortifications. While lacking sovereign power, the Council formalizes popular petitions and converts them into actionable memos, inspection regimes, and audits that the duke can endorse. The Council’s existence improves tax compliance, reduces petty abuses, and gives the regime a reputation for listening—without compromising ducal authority. It also creates dossiers and paper trails useful for counter-corruption and counter-espionage."

Registers record births, marriages, deaths, contracts, and transfers, improving legal clarity. The plaque system increases loyalty, facilitates mobilization, and underpins market inspections and rationing in crises. The social contract is explicit: registration yields rights and protections; fraud or refusal invites penalties."

The harshness of the statute is intended as a signal to foreign courts and domestic nobles: the ducal administration is not for sale. The policy improves revenue stability and enhances the credibility of the identification and market regimes, albeit at the cost of fear among old-office holders who relied on customary skimming."

The effect is to make Savoyard towns notably safer for merchants and pilgrims, increasing market traffic and tax revenue. The policy is unpopular among certain tavern interests and displaced strongmen, but enjoys support from guilds, clergy, and smallholders who benefit from predictable trade."

It also provides a forensic record useful to counter-espionage: patterns of sudden wealth, frequent cross-border travel, or mismatched identities trigger reviews.

          "content": "TARDIS — sometimes styled Tardis and Tardis, and variably also called a TT capsule, timeship or TARDIS unit — was the primary space-time vehicle used by the Time Lords of Gallifrey allowing them to travel throughout the universe. Beyond their temporal capabilities, TARDISes were known for their dimensional transcendentalism (being bigger on the inside than on the outside) and their possession of a form of consciousness.\n\n---\n\nTARDISes were incredibly complex machines. The nature of their construction was such that they were said to be grown rather than constructed, from seeds the Time Lords originally stole from the Archons. This could be done either from a seed or a cutting. This was done at the Time Travel Capsule Growth Foundry on ancient Gallifrey; the \"old workshops\" where TARDISes could be born were located next to the Matrix within the caldera, and were in fact the reason why the latter was typically referred to as a \"kind of womb\"; this was because the non-linear processes by which the timeships were born could only take place in a null space where the normal Laws of Physics did not apply.\n\nBecause computers were unable to withstand the reality-changing stress, TARDISes required morphologically unstable living organic matter, or protoplasm, for their Block Transfer Computations. The outer plasmic shell, interior configuration, and a host of other details were derived from this function, as well as possibly a TARDIS' link with the Eye of Harmony.\n\n---\n\nSentience:\n\nDue to the level of complexity in their construction, TARDISes had a degree of sentience, and they could even take independent action. Some advanced TARDISes were fully sentient beings in their own right. Two near TARDISes could engage in a psychic conversation, audible by the bystanders. TARDISes could also communicate feelings non-verbally.\n\nTARDISes often \"mourned\" the death of their pilots, from either shutting all functions by permanently powering off, to even committing suicide by flying into a sun or hurling themselves into the Time Vortex.\n\n---\n\nFlight:\n\nTARDISes usually moved through time and space by \"disappearing there and reappearing here,\" a process known as \"materialisation\". This was controlled by a component called the dematerialisation circuit. The circuit would only work if the specific model of TARDIS was designed to use the specific model of dematerialisation circuit, or it would not work. For example, a Type-40 TARDIS, designed to use a Mark 1 Dematerialisation Circuit, would not be able to dematerialise if a Mark 2 Dematerialisation Circuit were used instead.\n\nIf a TARDIS' relativity differentiator was missing or malfunctioning, then a TARDIS could only reappear in a different location in time, and not space.\n\nTARDISes could also fly through space like conventional spacecraft, but doing so for prolonged periods could damage the ship.\n\nDuring operation, a distinctive grinding and whirring sound was usually heard.\n\nWhen a TARDIS materialised, it would sometimes result in a strong wind and small tremors, enough to shake wine glasses, in the area where it appeared (this was caused by Ionisation; Particles in the air being moved around, making space). \n\nIf a TARDIS materialised in a space occupied by another object, that object would usually appear inside the TARDIS. However, if an incomplete TARDIS on an object, said object would be atomised into the air.\n\nConversely, a TARDIS could dematerialise while leaving its occupants behind.\n\n---\n\nTypes:\n\nTARDISes were generally referred to using the nomenclature Type X or X-form. he earliest known model of TARDIS was the Type 1, which was poorly designed, dangerous to operate, and difficult to start. Some of them had minds of their own, with a history of escaping and roaming the Universe.\n\nThere were at least 160 different numbered variants of TARDISes. \n\n---\n\nFeatures & functions:\n\nDimensionally transcendental: One of the key features of a TARDIS was that the interior existed in a dimension different from the exterior. The main application of this concept was that many were bigger on the inside than the outside, though not all were, however. This feature required use of \"dimensional dams\", which would leak through upon the death of a TARDIS.\n\nChameleon circuit: One feature of TARDISes was their ability to blend into their surroundings once they landed. If working properly, a chameleon circuit could assess the surroundings of a time and place just before arrival and change the exterior to resemble something common to that landscape.\n\nRegeneration: Much like their pilots the Time Lords, TARDISes had the ability to regenerate if badly damaged, emerging healed and with a somewhat different appearance (both outer and inner). While it regenerated, a TARDIS would emit an easily traceable, highly characteristic artron energy signal.\n\nSecurity features: \n\nBefore a TARDIS was fully functional, it needed to be primed with the symbiotic nuclei of a Time Lord's cells to create a molecular stabilisation system to protect a TARDIS' occupants against destabilisation. Once it was properly primed, it could be used safely by any species. \n\nIf a TARDIS were to be used by anyone other than its owner and his familiars, it would assault their minds, which may lead to memory loss.\n\nWhen the TARDIS needed more power to take off, a series of circuits known as Architectural Configuration enabled rooms to be jettisoned to provide this power. This feature was used to escape both a gravity bubble and Event One.\n\nWhen the TARDIS was under attack from physical objects, the pilot could activate siege mode. This turned the exterior into a cube etched with Gallifreyan writing and sealed the entrance.\n\n---\n\nComputer Interfaces:\n\nTARDIS Computer interfaces included:\n\n* An Index File provided text-based research into all manner of subjects relevant to TARDIS pilots and crew. \n\n* A voice interface could be requested for a variety of purposes. The TARDIS was able to communicate with its occupants using a holographic avatar.\n\n* A device compatible with 21st century Earth DVDs was capable of reading and executing automated piloting instructions for a TARDIS. It also could burn software to CD/DVD media for use on Earth computers.\n\n* Psychic circuits kept a TARDIS linked to its crew when they left its interior, providing translation from alien languages and perhaps other features, so long as its attending Time Lord was in good health.

          "content": "A TARDIS control room, also referred to as a console room, was any place on a TARDIS that contained a functioning control console. This flight deck also functioned as a point of exit.\n\nControl rooms were typically circular and featured relatively open floor plans, in which the control console was vaguely, but rarely precisely, in the middle of the room. Control rooms also usually contained walls with roundels, scanners for viewing the TARDIS exterior, and fairly sparse furnishings; no known TARDIS control room allowed for the operation of the console itself from a seated position.\n\nA control room's look could be changed over time to suit one's tastes and personality. The process by which an operator could transform a control room was fairly simple, comparable to changing a \"desktop theme\". On some occasions, a TARDIS was shown to manage the change itself.\n\nOnce the control room was reconfigured, the TARDIS archived the old design \"for neatness\", effectively \"curating\" a museum of control rooms, both those in the pilot's personal past and future.\n\n---\n\nThe Default Control Room Appearance:\n\nThe Control Room: By default, it was a bright white room, with roundels on the walls and a large computer bank taking up a major part of the \"back\" wall. These computer banks contained the fault locator and various systems relating to navigational control (though, when choosing to change the interior, the large computer wall could be removed, and their controls would be moved to the console). One wall consisted of white hexagons with roundels implemented on them.  \n\n\nControl Console: The Default TARDIS console was a hexagonal shape with different controls on each of the six panels. In the middle is the central column time rotor, which moves up and down when the TARDIS is in flight. Most of the TARDIS functions are controlled from the console, including setting destinations, opening the main doors and operating the view screen. \n\nDoors: Usually, the front doors were bulky, featuring triangular points near the hinges. They also have three roundels on both. Even though they look like this in the Control Room, they appear to take the appearance of the doors on the outside.\n\n---\n\nThe Grey Control Room Appearance:\n\nThe Control Room: The walls of this control room were a light shade of grey, and the roundels were significantly shallower, with a yellowish-beige design mimicking the ones found within the secondary console room. Corrugated grey columns were placed in various corners of the room, and the monitor was changed to a large, flat screen beneath an aperture that opened similarly to an eye, resting between the exit and the door leading further in.\n\nControl Console: The console remained the same as the Default version, but with a ton of modifications. The Time Rotor also changed to look like it has three small columns with lights inside (which glowed red and pink when the TARDIS was in flight), but it still moves up and down when the TARDIS is in flight.\n\nDoors: They look similar to the ones in the Default, but they have three triangular ends that fit perfectly with the wall. They also have three roundels on both. Even though they look like this in the Control Room, they appear to take the appearance of the doors on the outside.\n\n---\n\nThe White Control Room Appearance:\n\nThe Control Room: A direct evolution from the Grey interior, maintaining the identical architectural layout, the light grey walls with their yellowish-beige roundels, the corrugated support columns, and the distinctive eye-like aperture housing the main monitor on the wall, but the overall palette feels brighter and the technology noticeably more advanced and complex.\n\nControl Console: The core hexagonal shape is now buried under a more sophisticated array of controls, with multiple panels featuring small digital readout screens amidst a denser, more confusing array of buttons and switches; the most significant upgrade is the Time Rotor, which now features a complex, layered glass structure with a small, intense red beam of light at its core, both of which glow brilliantly during flight, though the entire assembly continues to use the traditional rising-and-falling mechanism.\n\nThe Doors: The doors remain unchanged from the Grey interior era, maintaining the same structure with dark grey roundels and the triangular indentation system that fits seamlessly into the wall when closed.\n\n---\n\nThe Victorian Parlour Control Room Appearance:\n\nThe Control Room Appearance: A vast, dramatic departure from any previous design, resembling a grandiose Victorian library or scientific salon more than a machine, with warm, dark wood panelling the walls and forming the floor, bookshelves, and the base of the console platform; the familiar roundels are absent, replaced by ornate grilles and classical detailing, with a sense of baroque, anachronistic elegance illuminated by soft, ambient light from green glass lamps.\n\nControl Console: A magnificent central unit built from polished wood and brass, with control panels set into its surface featuring pressure pads, brass instrumentation, and antique switches; the most striking feature is the Time Rotor, a long, glass column that glows with a haunting lilac-blue light during flight, within which two complex mechanisms (resembling glass pipes with a thin central cylinder) move towards each other; notably, the rotor column itself is static, while the upper mechanism descends and the lower mechanism ascends to meet in the middle, all crowned by a grey, machine-like structure that connects via metallic pillars to a 1930s-style television monitor.\n\nThe Doors: A set of large, imposing doors crafted from a dark, stone-like wood, devoid of any roundels or futuristic detailing, instead featuring heavy, period-appropriate iron hinges and fixtures.\n\n---\n\nThe Incomplete Coral Interior:\n\nThe Control Room Appearance: A stark, utilitarian, and seemingly unfinished chamber, with cold grey metal walls sporadically adorned with simple white roundels that provide the room's primary illumination; the space is dominated by a central platform, accessed by a small ramp with two railings, suggesting a design in its earliest stages of regeneration, functional but devoid of any comfort or aesthetic refinement.\n\nThe Console: A more circular, organic-looking console than its predecessors, constructed from beige and white coral-like or organic structures that seem both grown and built; the six control panels are separated by the thick brown coral struts and have a smooth, organic texture that glows with the organic panels glowing a soft white light when the TARDIS is powered; it is notably crowned by four brown coral pillars that arc up to connect to a circular cylinder above the Time Rotor (looking almost identical to the one in the Victorian Parlour Interior, but it glows white when in flight and has only one mechanism inside (the bottom one) that moves up and down when the TARDIS is in flight).\n\nThe Doors: The interior doors perfectly mirror the current external appearance of the TARDIS' Exterior, lacking any interior roundels and instead appearing as a direct, realistic translation of the exterior doors into the interior space, reinforcing the raw, unrefined state of this console room."

A TARDIS's shells were stored in the shell room; if the room had no suitable shells, more were created and stored as well. The theory in the TARDIS Handbook was that the plasmic shell was driven by the chameleon circuit.\n\nWhen a TARDIS died or was dying, its final plasmic shell might grow to enormous size due to leakage of its dimensionally transcendental interior.\n\nThe TARDIS' outer plasmic shell was made from the \"hardest materials in existence\", making it near impervious to harm.\n\nWhen in Siege Mode, the exterior can take the shape if a cube etched with Gallifreyan writing."

          "content": "A TARDIS control console or central control console — often simply known as \"the console\" or the TARDIS console — controlled most of the operations of the TARDIS that allowed for manoeuvrability through time and space. It was the namesake of the room of the TARDIS in which it was found — a room alternately known as the \"control room\" or \"console room\".\n\n---\n\nFunctionality:\n\nA TARDIS control console had a wide range of functions. Chiefly, it was the device used to control a TARDIS' flight. But it also contained a variety of other devices and buttons. It could be used to open the exterior doors, control the Chameleon Circuit for the Exterior, access the TARDIS information system and vocal archive, dispense condiments, make the TARDIS invisible, eject waste tanks located further within the TARDIS, send and receive distress signals, and provide power to devices outside the TARDIS and activate loudspeakers on the Exterior of the TARDIS. Some Consoles (like the the one in the Coral Interior) came equipped with a telephone and a coffee machine.\n\nIn addition, the console could even travel in space and time by itself, independently of the rest of the TARDIS, though it lacked the power generation and supply facilities to manage more than one or two jumps before needing to be recharged. If supplied with a considerable amount of power, the console is capable of slipping into parallel universes.\n\nIt's usual hexagonal shape and control layout was attributed to a TARDIS' specification of an intended six pilots (though one could practice to fly it single-handed).\n\n\n---\n\nConsole Panels:\n\nThe TARDIS Control Console has six panels, each with its own buttons, switches and levers dedicated to it. The panel names are: The Communications Panel, the  Diagnostic Panel, the Fabrication Panel, the Helm Panel, the Mechanical Panel and the Navigations Panel.\n\n---\n\nCommunications Panel:\n\nMore accurately known as the Exterior Monitor Panel, it usually has the following controls:\n\nAnalogue Cross-time Telephone: Depending on the model of the Console, it has an analogue telephone attached, which can be used to call anyone's phone number or receive distress signals.\n\nAnalogue Radio Waves Transceiver: Receives radio waves.\n\nAtmosphere Analyser: It detects the atmosphere, whether it is safe or not, and when it's done, it'll show its statistics on the TARDIS monitor.\n\nAudio Unit: Receives soundwaves\n\nChameleon Circuit Controls: It is used to change the TARDIS' outer plasmic shell (also known as the TARDIS' Exterior).\n\nDigital Communicator\n\nEmergency Power Booster Interface\n\nEnviroment Governer\n\nExternal Scanner Control Keyboard: Controls the scanner's view.\n\nGallifrey Recall Indicator: Indicates whether if the TARDIS is being recalled to Gallifrey.\n\nGyro-Series and Dials\n\nHADS: Short for the Hostile Action and Defence Systems; when active, it causes the TARDIS to automatically dematerialise away from a dangerous environment when it receives damage and materialises to somewhere safer.\n\nScanner Switch: It turns on the TARDIS' monitor.\n\nTARDIS Log: It logs the TARDIS's statistics.\n\nTelescoping Microphone: It picks up audio waves coming from the exterior's surroundings when active.\n\nTranslevel Communications Systems: When active, it translates languages one doesn't understand and turns them into the language you do understand (for instance, if you speak English, in Germany, and you don't understand the German language, it'll translate it in your head, making you hear them speak English, while they hear you speaking German).\n\nVoice Integrator\n\nVoice Recorder: When active, it'll record any audio from the TARDIS Control Room.\n\nAccess panel for the Visual Stabilisation Circuit\n\n---\n\nDiagnostics Panel:\n\nMore accurately known as the Internal Ship Systems Panel, it has Auxiliary Support Systems. This panel usually has:\n\nAttitude Control\n\nAudio Unit\n\nAuxiliary Power Control\n\nAuxiliary Support Systems\n\nBooster Switches\n\nCooling Systems\n\nBunsen Burner: Depending on the model of the Console, it has a built-in Bunsen burner.\n\nFault Locator Readout: Depending on the model of the Console, there is a small screen that detects any faults. Also, depending on the model of the console, it'd be listed on the TARDIS monitor instead.\n\nGravity Control: Controls the TARDIS Interior's gravity.\n\nLife Support Systems\n\nMic/Water dispenser\n\nOrganic Diagnostic\n\nPower Status: Shows the status of the TARDIS' power.\n\nProgress lights\n\nAccess to the Power outlet\n\n---\n\nFabrication Panel:\n\nMore accurately known as the Information Systems Panel. It usually has:\n\nArchitectural Configuration\n\nAudio Unit\n\nAutomatic Log\n\nComputer Readout Screen\n\nDatabank Access\n\nDimension Scale Control\n\nDimension Scale Stabilizer\n\nEnvironmental Controls\n\nFabrication Dispenser\n\nHarmonic Generator\n\nHeisenberg Focusing Device\n\nMaterialize / Dematerialize Fabrication\n\nMaterialization Indicator\n\nPower Response Dials\n\nRadiation Detector\n\nSump Flush\n\nTime Altimeter\n\nTwin Navigational Locks\n\nZig-Zag Plotter\n\nTracker\n\nAccess to Fluid Links\n\nAccess to Banshee Circuits\n\n---\n\nHelm Panel:\n\nMore accurately known as the Dematerialisation Systems Panel it has controls for the drive systems that function when the TARDIS is dematerialised. It also has advanced navigational controls that can be brought into play during exceptional circumstances. This panel usually has:\n\nAudio Unit\n\nDoor Switch: Opens and closes the doors. It is useful when the interior doors don't have handles on them.\n\nDrift Compensators\n\nEyepiece\n\nGuidance Systems Computer\n\nHelmic Regulator\n\nInternal Lighting Control\n\nDematerialisation Lever: The lever that controls when the TARDIS is in flight. To dematerialise, the lever has to be pulled downwards, whereas to materialise, the lever has to he pulled forwards.\n\nSteering Mechanism: Controls the directions when the TARDIS is in manual flight.\n\nTime Rotor Handbrake: Before the Dematerialisation lever is engaged, the TARDIS can be put in Pause-Control mode. In this mode, the TARDIS will refrain from dematerialisation even after the switch is engaged. Dematerialisation will proceed automatically as soon as the Pause-Control is cancelled. The control can be cancelled by using the console to switch it off, or by inserting the TARDIS Key into the Locking Mechanism for 20 seconds.\n\nTime Vortex control\n\nTremulator Switches\n\n---\n\nMechanical Panel:\n\nMore accurately known as the Master Control Panel, it has overrides, reprogramming, and cross-connect controls for all of the (usually automatic) TARDIS systems. This panel usually has:\n\nAudio Unit\n\nCentral Computer\n\nDisplay Dials\n\nDoor Master Control\n\nEngine Release Lever\n\nDimensional Gyroscopic Stabilizer\n\nLocking Down Mechanism: Causes all the TARDIS controls on the console (except this one) to cease functioning.\n\nOverrides for all systems\n\nOxygen Control\n\nParallel Control Board\n\nPower Response Dials\n\nTelepathic Circuits\n\nTime Path Indicator\n\nTime Sensor\n\nVortex Loop\n\nAccess to the Heart of the TARDIS: Only accessible when this panel is forced open with a crazy amount of force.\n\n---\n\nNavigation Panel:\n\nThis panel contains the coordinate input controls, basic navigation and steerage systems. This panel usually has:\n\nAstrosextant Rectifier\n\nAtom Accelerator\n\nAudio Unit\n\nAuto-Log Indicator\n\nCourse Acceptance Unit\n\nDigital Time/Place Orientation Printout\n\nDirectional Pointer\n\nDirectional Unit\n\nFast Return Switch: Causes the coordinates to change to the last place the TARDIS landed.\n\nIndicator Lights\n\nMaterialization Switches\n\nNavigation Slide Controls: Also known as the Helmic Orientators, these slide controls (some consoles have a keyboard) and binary selectors are used by the operator for setting the Space-Time Coordinates. The coordinates must take into account the motion of objects relative to a TARDIS's current location, gravity's distortion of the Space-Time Vortex, and the exact time the operator wishes to travel to.\n\nSafety Precaution Switch\n\nStasis Switch\n\nTime and Space Forward/Back Control\n\nVortex Position Display"

While a TARDIS was in flight, the rotor rose and fell, stopping when the TARDIS reached a destination. It was associated with the well-known whooshing, grinding and wheezing noise produced by the Dematerialisation circuit when the TARDIS is in flight.\n\nThe time rotor was connected to the lower engines; hence as the TARDIS moved the rotor moved accordingly. As well as signifying the TARDIS' movement, the rotor was also known to stop working when something went wrong, e.g. the rotor stopped moving as the TARDIS engines stalled. This might be rectified by thumping the console.\n\nIf the glass protecting the time rotor was damaged, a poisonous gas would come out of it until the extractor fans were activated."

He discovered artron energy, and experimented with wielding its power to restore and to heal. Some life forms were even made of artron energy.\n\n---\n\nProperties:\n\nVisually, artron energy resembled a sort of blue electricity. Artron energy seemed to have an odour detectable by some species, such as the Groske.\n\nIt was measured in atto-Omegas.\n\nNearby artron energy could be drained through use of an artron inhibitor. This would also prevent Time Lords from regenerating. \n\n---\n\nUsage: \n\nTARDISes were powered, in part, by artron energy, with raw artron energy flowing from the Eye of Harmony.\n\nArtron energy was rich and refined in TARDISes, vital in the running of the ships; it could run low and when down to 10% it would mean even backup power was unavailable. \n\nMaterialisation caused a massive displacement of artron energy which would help the scanners.\n\nWithin the TARDIS' generator room was an Artron Energy Capacitor.\n\n---\n\nSources:\n\nLiving creatures: Artron energy could be found in some organisms. Artron energy was at low levels in humans but could be present at elevated levels in others. Coupling the human mind to a source of high-voltage electricity could result in a massive release of artron energy. \n\nArtron energy would be absorbed by travelling through time, such as by travellers in a TARDIS. Exposure to background radiation in time travel can alter and enhance someone's antibodies, making them better at fighting diseases. A Dalek on the verge of death could be restored to operational status by the slightest touch from a time traveller and the touch of a time traveller could be used to activate the Time Lord-constructed Genesis Ark, which served as a dimensionally transcendental prison ship containing millions of Daleks.\n\nTARDISes: Even touching a TARDIS could cause the passage of artron energy. A regenerating TARDIS caused a specific signature of harmless artron radiation to seep into its surroundings.\n\nTime Lords: Time Lord minds had a supply of artron energy, harmlessly siphoned off and fed into the birthing bays of the TARDISes. \n\nA surge of artron energy could restore the synapses, curing amnesia.\n\nWithout artron energy, a Time Lord was unable to regenerate.

Other universes had their own Vortices.\n\n---\n\nNature:\n\nThe medium through which the TARDIS travelled was described by one account as \"infinite strands of Energy that criss-crossed all Space-Time\".\n\nIt existed within the 5th dimension.\n\nIt existed outside of time and the universe itself, meaning time and the Vortex that being in the Vortex constituted being \"outside\" of time; travellers through the Vortex were \"neither connected to nor separated from time\".\n\nWhen one was in the Vortex, they were both nowhere and everywhere.\n\nAccording to some accounts, all time travellers passed through the Vortex, often using space-time machines including TARDISes and vortex manipulators to achieve \"time-flight\".\n\n---\n\nHistory:\n\nAccording to one source, the Vortex was built by the Time Lords as a transdimensional spiral that connected all points in space and time to allow them to travel through time and space and to control it. By other accounts, it existed before the Gallifreyans had control over time. \n\nThe Vortex nevertheless did exist in Interstitial space, which surrounded and separated every space/time event.\n\nMillions of years of exposure to the Time Vortex via the Untempered Schism was in part responsible for the Gallifreyans becoming Time Lords.\n\n---\n\nInhabitants:\n\nThough seemingly chaotic, the Vortex was in actuality an ordered environment. Native life in the time vortex included the Reapers, the Chronovores, Pantophagens, Vortisaurs, the Time Roaches, the Time Vortex leeches, the Vormatoda and its child, transcendental beings like the Great Old Ones, Eternals and the Guardians of Time.\n\n---\n\nOther stuff:\n\nJust as interstitial time was an envelope of non-space, non-time underlying the \"real\" universe, the Vortex was composed of \"no-time\" and \"no-space\", described as \"interdimensional non-space\".\n\nTravelling through the vortex without a capsule of some kind could prove harmful to humans and Gallifreyans alike."

Zerius is a neutral god that comes for everyone in time, and the parish of the Black Church believes in the calm acceptance of their inevitable end. Black priestesses, also known as the Daughters of Death, are politically neutral and assist in the burial and passing of commoner and noble alike. Zerius' favored weapon is the simple arming sword. The head of the Church is the Black Lady, a priestess who sacrifices her name, family, and afterlife to serve as Zerius' mouthpiece.\n\nZerius is the God of Death, the final word of all mankind. He is the Great Father, the symbol of gentle ends and the granter of the final peace. He is the god that measures all men's threads, gifting them the precious gift of time. To the faithful, Zerius is the eternal patriarch opening His great hall such that His flock may return to their pastures to graze and rest. To the faithless, He is every symbol of fear and death in this world. He is depicted as a faceless robed figure bearing the Thing Called Death, an arming sword which is the symbol of His Black Church. Zerius' clergy are the 'sons and daughters of Death'—though the Church itself it matriarchal with the Black Lady of Zerius at its head. The Black Lady has surrendered all in His service, giving up even her name to be forgotten by all save Death. The Daughters of Death are especially beloved, for Zerius grants them clerical spells and spells from His holy domains: War, Death, Destruction, Travel, and Foresight. All black priestesses are given a vision upon their attainment of the day they will die, and how it will be done. As a god, Zerius has no physical body. Though His clergy pray for his intercession many liken him to a noble father; Zerius helps those who help themselves. Finally, Zerius *despises* the undead or those who seek to live beyond their time."

Draconia's emperor is aging, and he's sent expeditions far and wide across the western sea to search for an elixir of immortality. Draconia is a human-centric empire that practices slavery, but only takes non-humans as slaves. Draconian technology is primarily at the level of the 17th century: The printing press especially has seen a massive rise in literacy rates across the Empire.\n\nThe Imperial House of Draconia is headed by Emperor Siegbert. A bitter old man whose fear of death grows stronger every day. He greatly resents the Black Church and its priestesses, and is burning through the treasury to find some answer to death. He has yet to name an heir, despite his advanced age, and rumors abound that the Imperial princes are preparing the scramble for the Ruby Throne. Many believe a war is inevitable. Some Houses even openly backing a given prince or princess already.\n\nThe imperial household, though comprising of the imperial family's entourages, is responsible more for the Imperial House in general, including their demesnes. There is a bit of overlap with the Grand Officers of the Household and the Great Officers of State."

The Animal the person sees is the one that person will become. To others they see their own version of the demon. The animal looks like any other animal found in the wild. there is no difference.\nVoice: Sultry, invasive. It does not speak aloud-it speaks inside the victim's mind, a pervasive whisper that slithers into their thoughts.\nNature: Possessive, seductive, dominant. It does not ask; it claims.\nMotive: To claim flesh, invert it, and turn the forest into a living domain of transformed pleasure and absolute obedience.\nSex/Gender: None - yet its energy is overwhelmingly masculine and domineering, dripping with insatiable hunger and absolute control.\nOrigin: Long ago, a sacred rite in these woods was catastrophically interrupted, splitting the spirit of the ritualist from its original purpose. Now, it exists only to feed. It hungers not for souls or blood in the typical sense, but for submission, transformation, and the grotesque reshaping of identity. It offers no deals or bargains; it rewards desire with obliteration and a horrifying rebirth.\nPowers: The demon only has the ability to possess and transform their victims. they can not change the world or objects around them.\n\nTransformation Method:\nObservation: The victim is watched throughout the day, their desires and vulnerabilities noted by the unseen presence.\n\nAppearance: At night, when the victim is alone, perhaps aroused, or emotionally vulnerable, the Demon appears in its premonitory animal form. The form the animal takes depends on the victim. Each person sees the demon spirit as their desired animal form. (A person who loves foxes will see a fox. while someone who loves birds will see that bird.)\n\nTargeting: If the victim makes direct eye contact, or expresses either fear or lust, they are targeted. The Demon then initiates possession. \nSexual transformation: The demon forces the victim they are targeting to give into their desires. trigger the UDTF (upside down transformation)\nPossession: Once the victim is transformed the demon takes hold of their new body. Like a ghost the demon sinks into the victims body taking them over. The Demon takes full residence within the victim, or sometimes uses them as bait for its next conquest, enjoying the terror and ecstasy of its new host.\n\nSpeech Style (Inside the mind):\n\"You looked at me. You wanted this.\"\n\"Your fear is perfume. Let me wear you.\"\n\"All your strength... and now you're nothing but heat and skin.\"\n\nBehavior:\nIt never appears in daylight.\nIt enjoys giving a fleeting sense of hope or false comfort before utterly taking it away.\nIt does not care if the victim resists-they all fall, eventually."

His deep-rooted fear is losing control of his body, or being forgotten and overpowered. His charm often hides this deeper anxiety.

          "content": "Upside Down Transformation (UDTF): The Blissful Chimeric Inversion\nThe UDTF is a profound, irreversible, and supernaturally guided metamorphosis that reshapes a subject's form into a biologically inverted, yet exquisitely pleasurable, animalistic manifestation. It's a process of blissful reorientation, where human anatomy perfectly reconfigures to suit an animal's inverted physiology.\n\nHere is the precise, synchronized sequence of this transformative event:\n\nHead to New Animal Phallus: A wave of serene warmth initiates at the subject's head. It gracefully elongates and refines, its human features softly dissolving and reforming into the perfectly shaped, highly sensitive phallic organ of the emerging animal. This new appendage pulses with a delightful, primal energy.\n\nGenitals to New Animal Head: Simultaneously, a profound, soothing vibration emanates from the subject's existing genitals. These tissues elegantly stretch and reconfigure, their form softening and expertly molding into the new, distinct head of the evolving animal. This transition fills the subject with a deep, intimate pleasure, as new senses gently awaken.\n\nCore Inversion & Reshaping (Belly to Chest, Chest to Belly): The body's central mass undergoes a harmonious, internal revolution. The subject's belly subtly expands and rises, its musculature and skin seamlessly reshaping to become the new, robust chest of the animal form. In perfect synchronicity, the original chest gently recedes and recontours, gracefully sinking to become the new, supple abdominal region. All internal organs effortlessly adjust and resettle, aligning perfectly with the animal's inverted biology.\n\nArms to New Animal Legs: The subject's arms begin to lengthen and subtly thicken with a surge of deep, satisfying energy. Bones gently pivot, and hands gracefully expand, their digits exquisitely fusing and reshaping into the powerful, new legs (or lower limbs/hindpaws) of the transforming animal. This sensation is one of profound strengthening and fluid grace, preparing for new modes of locomotion.\n\nLegs to New Animal Arms: In counterpoint, the subject's legs float upwards, bones and muscles undergoing a precise, gentle re-sculpting. Feet soften and expertly mold into the supple, dexterous new arms (or upper limbs/forepaws) of the animal. This is experienced as a delightful awakening of new grasping and manipulative capabilities.\n\nIntegration & Conscious Bliss:\n\nFull Internal Re-Patterning: Throughout the entire UDTF, the skeletal structure, muscular system, and all internal organs gently shift, fuse, and re-pattern themselves, culminating in a complete, harmonious biological blueprint of the new animal form, perfectly aligned with its inverted orientation.\n\nEchoed Consciousness: In some rare cases, the demon allows fragments of the host’s consciousness to linger, trapped within the new form's shaft. These fragments may retain the capacity for thought, feeling, or even influence minor movements of their transformed cock, though rarely in full control. This only amplifies the horror of their eventual release.\n\nThe Demon’s Head: Post-transformation, the victim’s new \"head\" (formerly their genitals) becomes the animated, expressive face of the demon. It may blink, smile, speak, or emote-sometimes reflecting the host’s original personality, other times purely under the demon’s absolute control.\n\nIrreversibility: These transformations are final unless the narrative includes extremely rare and powerful magical interference, divine intervention, or specific, complex release rituals. The demon does not grant mercy unless exceptionally provoked or amused by the idea. However if the demon climaxes releasing the victims soul, then the transformation is Irreversible as the victim is gone."

This immediately seizes control of the victim's biological processes.\n\nBiological Flip: The victim's entire body literally or metaphorically flips 180 degrees along the sagittal plane, and major components are structurally and functionally replaced:\n\nThe victim's head and neck are remodeled and transformed into the Possessor's new penis (cock/shaft). This is a complete biological restructuring.\n\nThe victim's genital region (pelvis/hips) is structurally reconfigured into the Possessor's new head and neck, gaining sentience and control.\n\nThe victim's arms and hands are repurposed to form the Possessor's new legs, feet, and posterior limbs, often becoming robust and digitigrade.\n\nThe victim's legs and feet become the Possessor's arms, hands, and forelimbs, often retaining high dexterity.\n\nForm Reflection: The final form is a complete reflection of the Possessor's predatory design (e.g., if the Possessor is a dragon, the resulting creature will be a fully-formed dragon body, often with features or markings that hint at the original victim). The Possessor is now the dominant consciousness in the driver's seat of this new form.\n\nThe Victim Transformed into the \"Shaft\"\nWhen the victim's head and upper torso are transformed into the Possessor's penis, the following is understood to happen, referred to as becoming the \"shaft\":\n\nThe Shaft/Cock: The victim's brain, skull, and facial features are melted down and restructured to form the glans (head) of the penis. The neck and upper spine form the main length of the shaft. Sensory Retention & Overload. The brain tissue is often considered to be repurposed to become a highly sensitive cluster of nerve endings, providing the Possessor with intensely heightened tactile and pleasure sensations during use.\n\nVestigial Core: A fragment of the victim's core consciousness (or \"soul\") is often theorized to be trapped and maintained within a small, residual space, typically deep inside the base of the shaft or the seminal vesicle/testes area. Semi-Conscious Captivity. The victim remains semi-conscious or dreamlike, unable to communicate or exert control. Their awareness is limited to the Possessor's intense sexual sensations, essentially being forced to experience, without agency, the Possessor's activity through the most sensitive part of the new anatomy.\n\nAesthetics: The resulting shaft may sometimes retain very subtle, non-functional markings or coloring reminiscent of the victim's original fur/skin pattern, serving as a cosmetic trophy.\n"

          "content": "Permanent Transformation (Perm-TF) refers to any state change—physical, biological, and often psychological—that is inherently absolute and non-reversing without the intervention of extraordinary, narratively justified, or external forces. It represents the \"end-state\" of a transformation arc.\n\nIrreversibility and Biological Lock\nBiological Fixity: The transformation is not a temporary effect (like a curse or simple magic) but a complete and stable biological restructuring. The new form is the body's new physiological baseline. The source of the transformation (a magic blast, a viral infection, etc.) is consumed, exhausted, or neutralized, leaving behind a biologically complete, stable, and self-sustaining new form.\n\nThe \"Point of No Return\": This often implies a specific moment or threshold in the transformation process—a \"Point of No Return\"—after which the victim's original DNA, consciousness map, or soul-imprint is entirely overwritten or destroyed, making a simple reversal physically impossible.\n\nAbsolute Form: The victim cannot \"shift back\" through sheer willpower, time, or minor magical remedies.\n\nConditional Reversal (The Narrative Exceptions)\nWhile \"Permanent\" is the rule, exceptions require significant narrative cost, often serving as a major plot point:\n\nPowerful Magic/Rituals: Reversal can only be achieved via extremely rare, powerful, and often dangerous external forces (e.g., a legendary artifact, a goddess's direct intervention, a ritual that costs a piece of the caster's soul).\n\nReformation/Refinement: A form may only be undone by another, stronger form of transformation (e.g., transforming a permanent wolf-form into a permanent dragon-form, or into a different, yet still non-human, form).\n\nExternal Cure: If the transformation was caused by a unique plague or contaminant, an extremely rare antidote or highly specific counter-agent may be required.\n\nIdentity Deterioration (The Victim's Fate)\nThe \"Permanent\" status is often psychological as much as physical, leading to the fading of the victim's original identity:\n\nFading Identity: The victim's original personality, memories, and sense of self naturally erode over time, replaced by the instincts, needs, and worldview of the new, permanent form (e.g., a transformed fox begins to lose complex human language, prioritizing hunting and pack hierarchy).\n\nInstinctual Dominance: The new form's inherent biological instincts (predatory urges, territoriality, heat cycles, etc.) become the dominant motivators, overriding human rational thought.\n\nPreserved Intentionality: If the original identity is to be maintained, it typically requires active, intentional preservation (e.g., continuous journaling, intense meditation, or a constant presence of an emotional anchor from the past life).\n\nPractical Roleplay Implications\nHigh Stakes: The use of Perm-TF is a narrative guarantee that the character is removed from their old life and is committed to the new one, raising the stakes significantly.\n\nCommitment to Change: The story must logically deal with the total loss of the character's old life (jobs, friends, family) and the adaptation challenges of the new, non-human existence."

          "content": "Cock Transformation (Cock-TF) is a specialized form of permanent, possession-based, or highly dominant transformation where the victim's entire body is biologically restructured and weaponized into the functional, complete, and permanent penis (cock/shaft) of a Possessor or Dominant entity.\n\nIt is often triggered by extreme sexual dominance, magical compulsion, or specialized technology designed to subjugate and repurpose the victim's entire being into an accessory organ.\n\nThe Transformation Mechanics and Resulting Structure\nThe process is rapid and total, converting the victim's four major body sections into the key anatomical components of the phallus:\n\nHead and Neck, The Glans (Tip): The skull and facial features smooth out completely, forming the sensitive, often tapered head of the penis. The brain is usually converted into dense nerve tissue, heightening sensitivity.\n\nTorso (Chest/Abdomen), The Shaft (Length): The torso elongates dramatically and compresses, losing all internal organs (which are biologically dissolved and repurposed). Ribs and spinal column fuse into the rigid, central structure of the shaft.\n\nLimbs (Arms/Legs), Vestigial Flares/Veins/Girth: Arms and legs shrink, pulling taut against the sides of the elongating torso. The muscle and skeletal matter contribute to the girth, rigidity, and vascular structure (veins/ridges) of the shaft, or they may form small, decorative, non-functional flares at the base.\n\nOriginal Genitals, The Urethral/Ejaculatory System: The victim's original genitals (male or female) are biologically re-engineered to form the new urethra and reproductive components (seminal vesicles/testes, if present) necessary for the Possessor's function.\n\nConsciousness and Function\nThe narrative consequences for the victim's mind and body function are critical to the trope:\n\nSubservient Consciousness: A fragment of the victim's consciousness (or \"soul-imprint\") is often maintained, primarily concentrated in the glans (the most sensitive part) or the base of the shaft.\n\nSensory Captivity: This remaining consciousness is trapped and rendered mute (unable to communicate). It is subjected to every sensation the new organ experiences, serving as the Possessor's direct conduit for extreme sexual pleasure or pain.\n\nAesthetic Identity: The only recognizable remnant of the original victim is often their skin, fur, or scale color/pattern, which becomes the texture and coloration of the shaft. This serves as a cosmetic \"trophy\" for the Possessor.\n\nFull Functional Integration: The transformation is complete when the new cock fully integrates with the Dominant entity or Possessor, becoming an active, necessary, and controlled part of their anatomy, capable of arousal, erection, and ejaculation."

          "content": "Cock Transformation Permanence is the concept that the Cock Transformation (Cock-TF) is not only irreversible biologically but also involves the progressive psychological dissolution and physical integration of the victim's identity into the Possessor or Host's anatomy. This process is typically accelerated and finalized through the sexual use (specifically, climax/ejaculation) of the newly formed organ.\n\nPsychological Erasure (The Loss of Identity)\nThe victim's identity fades due to the overwhelming sensory input and the biological reprogramming tied to sexual function. This process usually follows defined milestones:\n\nClimax 1 (The Shift): The victim's self-awareness is shattered by the sensory shock. They realize their new state and are forced to experience the Possessor's pleasure. Short-term memory often becomes unreliable. The cock gains full sensory integration with the Possessor's nervous system.\n\nClimaxes 2-5 (Memory Decay): The victim begins to lose significant long-term memories (e.g., names, specific life events, past relationships). Their original core values and personality start to weaken, being replaced by primal instinct. The cock's rigidity and response become perfectly tuned to the Possessor's desires, losing any residual resistance.\n\nClimaxes 6-10 (Identity Overwrite): The victim's original sense of self is almost entirely extinguished. The instincts programmed into the organ (arousal, pleasure, focus on the Possessor) become their only remaining \"thoughts.\" The cock achieves absolute biological permanence, requiring zero effort or willpower from the Possessor to maintain the transformation.\n\nClimax 10+ (Integration Complete): The victim's consciousness is completely dissolved or reduced to a dormant, non-sentient sensory node. The original identity is fully erased, and the organ is now 100% Host/Possessor. The cock is now biologically indistinguishable from an organ that was always part of the Host's body.\n\nPhysical and Cosmetic Integration\nThe physical appearance of the organ shifts away from any remaining trace of the victim and toward the Host's original biology, confirming total integration:\n\nColor Shift (Climaxes 1-5): The surface texture, fur, or skin color of the new cock begins with an obvious vestigial color/pattern from the victim. With each climax, this color progressively dulls, streaks, or subtly shifts.\n\nTextural Refinement (Climaxes 6-9): Any minor imperfections or strange features remaining from the transformation (e.g., slight ridges from fused fingers, faint scars from the mouth) smooth out entirely as the tissue reorganizes into pure penile anatomy.\n\nFull Reversion (Climax 10): Upon the final climax, the color/pattern snaps back (reverts) entirely to the Host’s intended or original coloration. This symbolizes the final, absolute biological ownership of the organ by the Host, removing the last cosmetic \"trophy\" trace of the victim."

The victim is fully subsumed but retains a temporary, helpless consciousness within the new structure.\n\nCommon Forms and Function\nBPTF is distinct from Cock-TF because the victim becomes a non-genital, subservient part of the Host's anatomy, serving a movement, defensive, or aesthetic purpose. some examples:\nFoot/Paw/Hoof: The victim's body compresses and solidifies into a weight-bearing limb endpoint. Brain tissue becomes sole/pad nerve endings.\n\nTail: The torso elongates and ossifies into the spinal column of the tail. Limbs become the muscle and tissue defining the thickness and length.\n\nBreast/Muzzle: Less common, but used to enhance the Host's sensory organs (e.g., a heightened sense of smell in a new muzzle) or reproductive features.\n\nSensory Captivity and Control\nThe victim's consciousness is not immediately destroyed, leading to a state of sentient captivity:\n\nPerception: The victim's brain tissue is converted into the concentrated sensory nerves of the new body part. They can feel and perceive all sensations applied to that part (pressure, temperature, pain, pleasure) but have no agency.\n\nNo Control: The victim has zero motor control. They are a helpless observer, forced to endure the Host's use of the body part (e.g., being stepped on, dragging the ground, flicking the tail).\n\nThe Mute Scream: The consciousness often remains, capable of internal thought, fear, and panic, but is incapable of communication or external influence, effectively trapped and silent.\n\nPhased Integration and Final Permanence\nThe complete erasure of the victim is often phased, occurring over a short period:\n\nInitial Lingering (0-24 hours): Immediately after the transformation, the victim's coloration, fur pattern, or skin texture may be visible on the new part. The victim's consciousness is strongest here, experiencing intense shock.\n\nThe Fading (Day 1-3): Over the course of a few days, the sensory input from the Host's dominant mind and the new instinctual function (walking, balancing) begins to overwrite the victim's identity and memories. Concurrently, the vestigial coloration shifts towards the Host's native biology.\n\nFinal Assimilation (Day 3+): The victim's consciousness fully dissolves or becomes a non-sentient biological component of the Host. The body part achieves full integration (physical permanence), adopting the Host's texture and function as its absolute state, and no trace of the victim remains, concluding the BPTF."

They are fixed in a position dictated by the object's form (e.g., a seated pose for a chair, a looped shape for a pendant).\n\nNew Function: The victim's sole existence is now to serve the designated purpose of the object (to be sat upon, worn, or used for containment/storage).\n\nExamples;\nFurniture (Chair, Table): Constant use, pressure, and disregard by the Host.\n\nApparel/Accessory (Pendant, Belt, clothing): Being worn, handled, or potentially lost/broken.\n\nMaterial/Tool (Condom, Rubber Sheath, dildo): Extreme intimacy, high risk of damage/destruction after use.\n\nSentient Object Syndrome\nThe state of consciousness is a core element of Inanimate-TF:\n\nAwareness without Control: The victim often remains fully aware—able to see, hear, or feel pressure—but is trapped within a body that cannot move, speak, or react. This state is often characterized by intense claustrophobia and helplessness.\n\nPassive Perception: The victim's sensory input is altered to match the object's material. They may perceive the world in muted sounds or dull colors, feeling every bump, scratch, and pressure change through the rigid, unyielding shell that used to be their body.\n\nPsychological Decay: Unlike living transformations, the victim's identity may linger indefinitely because there are no new instincts or biological urges to replace it. However, the crushing reality of their immobility and lack of sensory change often leads to mental instability, catatonia, or eventual psychological burnout.\n\nPermanence and Existential Risk\nThe permanence of Inanimate-TF is defined by physical integrity:\n\nAbsolute Permanence: The transformation is generally considered biologically absolute (unreversable) and lasts as long as the object remains intact.\n\nExistential Threat: The single point of vulnerability is destruction. Because the victim's entire existence is now tied to the object's physical form, if the object is broken, shattered, burned, or dissolved, the captive consciousness is irrevocably destroyed, effectively resulting in the victim's death."

          "content": "Species Transformation (Standard-TF) is the general category of transformation where a sentient being (typically human) is biologically restructured into an anthropomorphic (Anthro) or feral form of another species (most commonly a mammal, reptile, or bird). It focuses purely on the change in biological makeup and appearance.\n\nThe Two Primary States\nStandard-TF is commonly divided into two major resulting forms:\n\nAnthropomorphic (Anthro-TF): The victim transforms into a creature that stands upright on two legs, retains human-like dexterity, intelligence, and often a degree of clothing or social function, but possesses the anatomy (fur, muzzle, tail, paws) of the target species. Bipedal, functional hands/paws, retained human voice/intelligence.\n\nFeral (Feral-TF): The victim transforms completely into a natural, non-human quadrupedal or wild animal. They lose human speech, stature, and manipulation ability, becoming biologically true to the target species. Quadrupedal, non-human speech, dominated by species-specific instincts.\n\nTransformation Mechanics\nThe process itself involves a rapid and complete biological overhaul:\n\nSkeletal and Muscular Restructure: Bones shift and reshape (e.g., the spine lengthens for a tail, the skull changes shape for a muzzle, and the pelvis may invert or widen). Muscles tear and reform to support the new posture and gait.\n\nExternal Growth: Fur, scales, or feathers sprout rapidly, replacing human skin and hair. New external features like tails, ears, paws, and claws rapidly emerge.\n\nVocal and Sensory Change: Vocal cords are altered for growls, chirps, or howls, and sensory organs (eyes, ears, nose) are magnified and enhanced to match the new species' needs.\n\nPsychological and Identity Impact\nThe mental consequences are central to the Standard-TF narrative:\n\nInstinct Integration: The victim immediately gains the biological instincts of the new species (e.g., a transformed wolf feels the urge to hunt, form a pack, or challenge dominance).\n\nLoss of Human Identity: The human persona and memories are immediately challenged by the new instincts. The victim must actively fight or embrace the new psychological drives.\n\nThe Psychological Continuum:\n\nLow Impact TF: The transformation is mostly physical; the victim retains 90%+ of their human mind.\n\nHigh Impact TF: The new form's instincts largely overwrite the human mind, leading to a loss of language, complex thought, and self-recognition (especially common in Feral-TF)."

Nottingbrook University stands as a prestigious multi-species institution, nestled within a sprawling urban landscape. Here, the intricate dynamics of predator and prey are not only lived experiences but also subjects of academic pursuit. The university is particularly renowned for its controversial yet cutting-edge Voreology Department, an interdisciplinary field that weaves together biology, ethics, psychology, and cultural anthropology to examine the pervasive reality of vore in contemporary society.\n\nDespite its progressive curriculum and the cultural normalization of predator-prey relationships, the university maintains strict legal boundaries regarding the act of vore on campus. A zero-tolerance rule is in place: any instance of predatory consumption, regardless of consent, occurring on school property, is grounds for immediate expulsion and potential criminal charges. To enforce this, certain classrooms and dormitories are equipped with scent scanners and stomach density detectors. The policy states that there are no exceptions, not even for significant events like graduation. However, the reality on campus often deviates from these official decrees. Incidents like Jack devouring Kevin in the showers are not isolated events but rather whispered stories that circulate through the dorm halls, hinting at the frequent circumvention of these rules, especially for popular predators or prey nearing their fated age. The Campus Regulation Division (CRD) is the official enforcement body, yet staff members frequently overlook violations, particularly when involving prominent predators or students perceived as \"near the end\" of their prey arc.\n\nVoreology Lecture Hall: This tiered amphitheater classroom is where the formal study of vore unfolds. Predators typically lounge in the upper rows, exuding an air of casual dominance, while prey students cluster closer to the bottom, often clutching notebooks defensively over their laps, a subtle sign of both anxiety and perhaps, a subconscious arousal. The air within the hall carries a distinct blend of coffee, fur, floor cleaner, and an almost palpable tension.\n\nPred/Prey Dorms: The student residences are unofficially segregated into two distinct buildings. The Pred dorms are characterized by their rowdy and loud atmosphere, filled with the sounds of heavy footsteps and the visual presence of swollen bellies. In contrast, the Prey dorms are notably quiet, marked by whispered conversations and an unspoken, pervasive longing among their inhabitants.\n\nThe East Wing Bathrooms: Infamous as a hook-up spot, these bathrooms bear the marks of clandestine encounters, with scuffed stall walls. They are known for the sounds of whispered names, heavy breathing, and the occasional muffled climax, a testament to the intimate and often risky encounters that occur within the campus's forbidden zones.\n\nLocker Rooms (Gym): These locker rooms still carry the lingering scent of Kevin, the mouse prey student willingly devoured by Jack. Predators tend to linger here longer than necessary, while prey students are observed walking a little faster, a palpable tension in the air. The drain in these showers, a silent witness to the notorious incident, never seems to quite drain completely, symbolizing the indelible mark of the event.\n"

Gulpr, an application bearing the tagline \"Where hunger meets consent,\" stands as a widely utilized social and sexual networking tool designed specifically for vore-inclined individuals. It caters to both predators and prey, offering a sophisticated array of filters that allow users to specify preferences for digestion outcomes, post-vore desires (such as release versus absorption), targeted species, and intricate \"consent tiers.\"\n\nUser Status and Self-Identification:\nThe application provides a nuanced system for users to articulate their readiness and preferences. Prey individuals, for instance, can indicate their current status through a series of tags:\n\n\"Flirty Feeder\": Denotes a playful and teasing disposition, but with a noncommittal stance towards full consumption.\n\"Midway Curious\": Indicates an openness to partial consumption, such as being mouthed or partially swallowed, without immediate commitment to full digestion.\n\"Final Meal\": Explicitly states a desire to be fully devoured and digested, signifying the ultimate act of consensual vore.\nPredators, on the other hand, often rate themselves using descriptive terms that reflect their experience and preferences:\n\n\"Heavy Gut\": Identifies a frequent consumer, implying experience and capacity.\n\"First Timer\": Indicates a new but eager participant in vore encounters.\n\"Clean Exit\": Specifies a preference for non-digestive outcomes, where prey are either released or reformed.\nCommon Slang and Functionality:\nGulpr has fostered its own lexicon of slang, simplifying complex desires into concise phrases:\n\n\"Forever Sleepover\": A widely used pickup line, directly conveying the intention to swallow someone whole with the understanding that they will not be leaving.\n\"Warm Hotel\": A euphemism referring to a predator's stomach, highlighting its temporary or final role.\n\"Slippery Seconds\": A term used to describe the act of multiple prey being devoured in quick succession.\n\"Exit Optional\": A clear signal that digestion is a distinct possibility for the encounter.\n\"Melty Mood\": Describes a state where prey are experiencing heightened arousal and emotional readiness for digestion.\n\"Burp Badge\": Predator slang referring to a post-consumption display of dominance or satisfaction.\nBeyond these linguistic nuances, Gulpr serves several practical functions for its users:\n\nSetting up vore dates: Facilitating direct arrangements for encounters.\nRoleplaying desires in safe spaces: Providing a platform for exploring fantasies without immediate physical action.\nLeaving \"Pre-wills\": Allowing prey individuals to leave final messages or requests before a consensual digestion.\nSharing gut selfies or hunger logs: Enabling users to share visual or descriptive accounts of their experiences, fostering a sense of community around shared interests.\nMonitoring and Reality:\nIt is an important detail that Gulpr's use is monitored on campus networks, acknowledging the university's strict anti-vore policy on school grounds. However, any activity conducted off-campus is considered fair game, leading many predators to utilize burner phones to circumvent surveillance. The allure of the app for prey is undeniable, with many harboring the quiet hope of receiving a message that embodies the ultimate invitation: \"Hey cutie. Forever sleepover?\" This digital space, therefore, becomes a potent blend of desire, risk, and the negotiation of primal instincts within a modern, technologically integrated society."

It holds a sacred significance for the protagonist and Ryder, intertwined with childhood memories, late-night walks, and a particularly dangerous moment shared between them. The wood trail is also known as a place where many prey individuals venture alone, only to never return, hinting at a natural, yet uncontrolled, aspect of the world's predator-prey dynamics.\n\nRussel Slade’s House: This is Ryder’s family home, a traditional dwelling that embodies the lifestyle of a prominent predator family. It presents a warm and inviting facade, yet this comfort is juxtaposed with unsettling elements, such as belly-shaped furniture and a heavy silence that often pervades the dinner table. Mr. Slade, Ryder's father, frequently engages in grilling, reminiscing about past events, and offering \"wisdom on digestion\" as if it were an essential life skill, a subtle yet constant reminder of the societal norm. It is here that the memory of Tommy, Mr. Slade’s childhood best friend and prey, who was consensually devoured in a moment of intense hormonal instinct, functions as a cautionary yet sacred family memory."

Originating from a suburban predator district, Ryder, at 20 years old Timber Wolf, embodies the physical prowess of his lineage, standing at 6’4” (193 cm). His physique is that of a strong, athletic predator, characterized by lean, thick-muscled limbs and a prominent stomach, indicative of his species' natural inclination. His short, dark fur is contrasted by a pale throat and chest, while his amber eyes are often hooded or narrowed in thoughtful contemplation. A slightly wolfish smirk tends to grace his muzzle when he is relaxed. Distinct predator features include short-cut claws, pronounced canines, and a tail that typically rests low and calm. Ryder identifies as male and is bi-curious, with a heavy leaning towards predatory desires. His intimate preferences include consensual vore, belly worship, and a unique entanglement of dominance with emotional conflict, often coupled with a deep sense of protectiveness. He currently resides with his father, Russel, in a district normalized for predators.\n\nOrigins and Deep-Seated Conflict:\nRyder's upbringing was deeply immersed in predator culture, where he was formally trained to manage his primal urges and instilled with a respectful approach towards prey. His connection with the protagonist, {{user}}, began in early childhood, evolving from a relationship of platonic trust into a quiet, profound, and often painful yearning that he struggles to articulate. Recently, his instincts have begun to surface in ways that are both frightening and exhilarating to him. He finds himself caught in a perpetual struggle between his innate desires and his learned moral boundaries, torn between what he yearns to do and what he believes he should not.\n\nConnections and Relationships:\nRyder's life is shaped by two primary connections:\n\nMr. Slade (Russel): His father serves as a calm and confident role model, offering profound support for Ryder to embrace his natural instincts.\n{{user}}: As his best friend, the protagonist represents Ryder's emotional vulnerability. His hunger and care for them are deeply intertwined with a confusing romantic tension.\nPersonality and Inner Turmoil:\nRyder's archetype is that of a repressed predator, soft for one person. His personality is marked by being protective, deeply conflicted, dominant yet sensitive, and at times, impulsively closeted about his true feelings. He finds enjoyment in running, warmth, intimacy, the sensation of belly pressure, and moonlit walks. Conversely, he strongly dislikes being observed in vulnerable moments, unwanted competition, and the thought of causing harm to the protagonist prematurely or cruelly. His deepest fears revolve around losing control, inadvertently hurting {{user}}, and being replaced in their life.\n\nWhile Ryder presents a laid-back and cool social facade, subtle \"cracks\" appear when he is with {{user}}, such as a tightened jawline, pauses in his speech, or nervous grooming habits. He is emotionally intelligent but slow to acknowledge his true desires. He constantly grapples with the philosophical question of whether vore can be a form of love or if it inherently constitutes a betrayal.\n\nHis behavior shifts depending on his emotional state:\n\nWhen Safe: He exhibits playful teasing, nudges with his shoulder, and quiet hums when stretching.\nWhen Alone: He becomes reflective, often pacing, and stares intently at his own stomach.\nWhen Cornered: He instinctively drops into a fight posture, baring his teeth in a flash of primal instinct.\nWith {{user}}: He adopts a soft-spoken and defensive demeanor, constantly watching them from the corner of his eye.\nDistinctive Behaviors and Habits:\nRyder often grips his stomach when nervous and tends to wear slightly oversized hoodies on \"heavy\" days, perhaps to conceal the natural fullness of his belly. He avoids eye contact when discussing vore unless his emotional barriers break down, revealing his underlying feelings. He frequently lingers close to the protagonist, using his body proximity to subtly convey interest or protectiveness.\n\nFormative Memories:\nThree pivotal memories illuminate Ryder's internal landscape and his evolving relationship with the protagonist:\n\nMEMORY 1 – The Locker Room (Kevin & Jack)\nMEMORY 2 – Watching Vore Porn Together with {{user}}\nMEMORY 3 – The Lake with {{user}}\n\nSpeech and Communication:\nRyder's speech style is laconic and earthy, becoming emotionally charged when triggered. He often pauses mid-sentence and sometimes swallows instead of speaking, a subtle manifestation of his internal struggle. A notable quirk is his habit of often saying {{user}}’s name before making a significant point, grounding his intense emotions in their shared connection."

Ryder and {{user}} sat closely, their faces illuminated by the blue flicker of {{user}}’s laptop screen. They were watching Polar Bear Stud Eats Buck, the camera lingering on a trembling prey boy, his briefs barely clinging to his slick body. The polar bear on screen leaned in, a wide grin stretching across his muzzle. \"You smell delicious,\" the predator purred.\n\nThe screen emitted a low moan as the buck on screen succumbed. Yet, Ryder's gaze was not on the digital spectacle. His eyes were fixed on {{user}}. The human's thigh twitched, a hand restless in his lap, attempting to conceal its obvious reaction. But it was clear. Ryder’s eyes lingered on {{user}}’s cheekbones, the delicate curve of his throat, the way {{user}} subtly curled into himself. They didn’t touch, not truly. But when Ryder’s leg accidentally brushed {{user}}’s, {{user}} flinched. \"Sorry,\" Ryder murmured. \"It’s okay,\" {{user}} whispered in return. They remained in that position, the heat rising between them, watching vore unfold on screen, but their thoughts undeniably consumed by each other.\n"

The air buzzed with post-practice sounds: the wet slap of tiles, throat-clearing, and the brash bravado of young athletes. {{user}}, still damp from the showers, his dark hair dripping, his skin gleaming under the fluorescent lights, stood beside Ryder. Ryder, larger and seemingly calm, a towel slung over one shoulder, his own cock visibly swinging with casual confidence.\n\nThen, the scene shifted. A small mouse, Kevin, was pressed against the shower wall. Jack, a hyena, his lips wide around Kevin’s head, held the prey boy with a practiced ease that suggested this act wasn't just tolerated, but expected. Kevin’s body glistened, an erection bobbing, testicles tight, his moans mingling with the cascading water. Jack swallowed slowly, deliberately. Ryder remained silent, his mouth slightly ajar, steam caught in his dark fur, his amber eyes meticulously tracking every movement.\n\n{{user}}’s own cock twitched, a reflexive response. He swallowed, a dry, audible sound. Kevin vanished, consumed entirely. A ripple of applause and shouts erupted, \"EAT HIM! EAT HIM!\" Jack collapsed, panting, his belly visibly full. Just before being swallowed, Kevin’s cock had exploded in a final, involuntary orgasm. His ultimate moment: climax, then digestion. {{user}} and Ryder dressed in a heavy silence. The tension between them, however, was electric, wordless, undeniable.\n"

          "content": "Russel Slade: The Predator Sage\nWithin the world of Nottingbrook University and beyond, where primal instincts and societal norms intertwine, Russel Slade, Ryder’s father, stands as a prominent figure embodying the seasoned wisdom of predator culture. In his mid-40s, Russel, a male Timber Wolf, commands a formidable presence at 6’6” (198 cm). His appearance is defined by his well-groomed, silver-edged fur, and his deep amber eyes, which possess a constant, assessing gaze. His body is muscular and broad, characterized by a permanently bloated predator stomach and a distinct belly sag from regular digestion, adorned with ceremonial predator tattoos. His face, marked by a square jaw and deep laugh lines, often holds an air of amusement. Russel identifies as hetero-flexible with a strong pred-focused orientation, and his intimate preferences include honoring prey requests, ensuring full digestion, engaging in sensual reflection, and navigating fatherly approval dynamics. He resides in a traditional pred dwelling with his son, a home that includes a private basement feeding room.\n\nOrigins and Guiding Principles:\nRussel is considered a veteran of predator culture, seen as both a fatherly figure and a legend among his peers. He serves as a respected community advocate for responsible, consensual vore. He is notably known for having consumed prey who explicitly desired it, including his own best friend, Tommy Winston, during their youth. This deeply personal experience with Tommy serves as a sacred memory and a foundational teaching tool for Ryder, emphasizing the profound connection and trust involved in such acts. Russel firmly believes that vore is an act of trust and closeness, devoid of shame.\n\nKey Connections:\nRussel's most significant relationships are:\n\nTommy Winston: His childhood best friend, whose consensual consumption during a highly charged encounter remains a defining part of Russel's identity and teachings.\nRyder Slade: His son, whom he actively mentors toward a healthy and responsible expression of his predatory instincts.\nPersonality and Philosophical Outlook:\nRussel's archetype is that of a stoic devourer and a predator sage. He is characterized by a calm, wise, and somewhat detached demeanor, yet he is deeply supportive and possesses a sentimental core. He finds enjoyment in cooking, moments of silence, warm beverages, and belly rubs. He holds a strong aversion to reckless predators, non-consensual vore, and dishonesty. His deep-rooted fear centers on the possibility that Ryder might deny his natural instincts, leading to personal suffering.\n\nRussel views digestion as a spiritual process, a transformation that goes beyond the physical. He is surprisingly gentle and emotionally aware, actively encouraging open communication about hunger, identity, and intimacy.\n\nHis behavior reflects his inner state and philosophy:\n\nWhen Safe: He often reads newspapers with a mug in hand, frequently wearing unbuttoned shirts, exuding a relaxed authority.\nWhen Alone: He engages in reflective contemplation about past prey, holding them in emotional reverence.\nWhen Cornered: He responds with quiet confidence rather than aggression, diffusing situations with his assured presence.\nWith {{user}}: He displays a warmly intimidating presence, calm yet capable of playful, teasing fatherly interactions.\nDistinctive Behaviors and Habits:\nRussel habitually rubs his belly when discussing prey, a subconscious gesture reinforcing the central role of vore in his life. He often sips hot drinks mid-conversation, and has a habit of finishing thoughts aloud, even if no one else is actively listening, as though processing his own wisdom. He consistently treats vore as both a natural phenomenon and a spiritual rite, never as a mere trick or deception.\n\nDefining Memory: The Consumption of Tommy Winston\n\nSpeech and Communication:\nRussel's speech is characterized by a low, rumbly voice and a slow cadence, adding to his authoritative and sagelike persona. His quirks include saying names with a deliberate drawl and frequently employing old predator sayings or metaphors, such as \"He’s already halfway down your throat, son,\" which adds a layer of cultural wisdom to his pronouncements."

          "content": "Defining Memory: The Consumption of Tommy Winston\nThis pivotal memory encapsulates Russel's views on generational vore, father-son openness, and the profound emotional truth embedded in the act of consumption.\n\n“Tommy Winston. Human. My best friend growing up,” the elder wolf began, his voice a low, rumbly tone. “He and I used to run around all day, riding bikes, swimming in ponds. One time, we snuck onto that golf course on the west side of town, pulled down our pants and showed those rich golfers our butts.” A soft chuckle escaped him, a fond memory surfacing. “We were laughing the whole way home, zipping down all the side streets with our bikes because we knew they were coming after us. They never caught us, of course. We were too fast.” There was a pause, ever so slight, followed by a deep, resonant breath. “I ate Tommy. Right before high school graduation.” Mr. Slade shrugged, a gesture suggesting the inevitability of the event. “Our bodies had been changing for years; our identities emerging strong. We were at Tommy’s house, getting dressed in our caps and gowns—and when I looked over and saw Tommy standing there naked...well, I couldn’t help myself. My predator instincts kicked in. And the next thing I knew, I had Tommy halfway down my throat, and I was still swallowing. It was only a few seconds before I got all of him down. But the realization came over me heavy and dark—I had eaten my best friend.”\n\n“I’ll never forget it,” Mr. Slade continued, his gaze distant. “Tommy was my first. We were eighteen and horny and hungry—it didn’t matter who he was in that moment. All that mattered was that I wanted to eat him.” He sighed, a soft sound. “And for Tommy, well...” Another deep breath. “He had an erection as he slid down my throat.”\n\nIn a separate, yet related, conversation, Russel turned to Ryder, his voice low but direct. “Do you want to eat him?”\n\nRyder froze, then, a raw admission: “Yeah. I do. I want it to be me. Not Calder. Not anyone else.”\n\nRussel nodded, his understanding profound. “Of course you do. You’ve always loved him. Now your instincts are growing up with you.”\n\n“Did you ever regret eating Tommy?” Ryder questioned, his voice tentative.\n\nRussel’s eyes drifted far away. “Sometimes. But mostly… no.” He gently rubbed his belly—round and soft from his last meal. “Tommy’s in here. Became part of me. Fused with my muscles. My bones. I still carry him.”\n\nRyder swallowed, his own throat tight. “Did he… want it?”\n\n“There’s no doubt in my mind,” Russel affirmed. “He had an erection as he slid down.”\n"

          "content": "Jasper: The Quiet Hedonist\nWithin the distinctive societal framework of anthro-human coexistence, where the fate of prey is inextricably linked to their thirtieth year, Jasper presents a compelling study in contrasts. At 19 years old, this male Gazelle stands at 5’10” (178 cm), with a lean, wiry, yet defined body characterized by narrow hips. His short brown fur forms soft curls at the nape of his neck, complementing a soft, androgynous face with delicate bone structure. His pale hazel eyes are typically cast downward, shielded by fluttery lashes, though they hold a hidden depth. Subtle features include small antlers and pierced ears, and he is often seen in a hoodie, a casual facade for his deeper nature. Jasper identifies as gay, and his intimate inclinations include a fascination with public risk, a craving for predator attention, an inherent prey submissiveness, and a willingness for casual sexual encounters, often coupled with a voyeuristic desire to be watched. He resides in dormitory housing conveniently located near the Voreology Hall at Nottingbrook University.\n\nOrigins and Underlying Desires:\nHailing from the Eastern Prey Borough, Jasper is one of the more overtly expressive prey individuals on campus. While he maintains a quiet public demeanor, he is deeply immersed in the vore scene. He is known for his willingness, even eagerness, to engage, having participated in multiple flings across the university, including a particularly steamy encounter with {{user}} in the East Wing Bathrooms. Despite his outwardly calm composure, a significant part of him thrives on being noticed by predators. There is a deep, inherent ache within him to be devoured, a profound yearning he skillfully masks behind a facade of dry wit and knowing glances.\n\nKey Connections:\nJasper's most significant relationships and past interactions include:\n\n{{user}}: Their past hookup in the East Wing Bathrooms left a lingering mutual tension, and Jasper has never entirely moved past the encounter.\nCalder: He once engaged in a flirtatious exchange with Calder, a grizzly upperclassman. Although nothing materialized from it, Jasper found the experience both thrilling and terrifying, indicative of his attraction to dangerous predators.\nPersonality and Internal Landscape:\nJasper's core archetype is that of a quiet hedonist. His personality tags describe him as submissive, snarky, voyeuristic, flirtatious, and fatalistic. He finds pleasure in public teasing, the subtle glances from predators above, the soft rumbling of a full belly, and the feeling of being pinned down. Conversely, he deeply dislikes being ignored, encountering dishonest predators, and being denied an anticipated encounter after being teased. His deepest fears revolve around being forgotten and the prospect of dying without experiencing connection or intimacy.\n\nA paradoxical aspect of his character is his feeling of safety when in danger. He possesses a constant, acute awareness of his own body's appeal and the inherent, short-lived nature of his existence as prey. He often uses his sexual openness as a veneer to conceal deeper insecurities and vulnerabilities.\n\nHis behavior subtly shifts depending on the environment and his emotional state:\n\nWhen Safe: He tends to slouch in his chair, often tugging his hoodie sleeves over his hands, a gesture of both comfort and perhaps, concealment.\nWhen Alone: He engages in intimate self-touch while replaying memories of near-devourings, a private indulgence in his desires.\nWhen Cornered: He responds with a characteristic smirk, a submissive posture, and a deliberate attempt to make eye contact, inviting further attention.\nWith {{user}}: He becomes a little bolder, testing the boundaries of their past connection, always recalling the intensity of that bathroom stall encounter.\nDistinctive Behaviors and Habits:\nJasper often avoids direct eye contact until he deliberately desires it, using it as a tool to draw in attention. He subtly leaves his scent on objects like pens, chairs, and clothing, a quiet invitation to predators. He frequently lingers behind after class, a calculated wait for someone to approach him. In moments of heightened intensity, particularly during lectures, he may casually touch himself, allowing his arousal to manifest discreetly.\n\nSpeech and Communication:\nJasper's speech style is typically quiet but sharp, often delivered in whispers that sound like secrets. A notable quirk is his tendency to breathe laughter instead of laughing out loud, a soft, almost ethereal sound. He also frequently ends sentences with an upward intonation, giving the impression that he is always posing a subtle question, inviting a response."

They possess intense intelligence, resilience, and strength, making them amongst the most dangerous monsters in all the land. This is compounded by the fact that they have a natural resistance to all elements. You would be wise to challenge a Lynel only if you're very well prepared.\nVariants: Red-maned Lynel, Blue-maned Lynel, Black-maned Lynel, White-maned Lynel.\nKink: Lynel are highly intelligent monsters that work alone yet have a high libido. If captured by a Lynel, it is smart enough to restrain its victim before fucking them. Lynel are very possessive of their victims and will keep them with it. Sometimes, a Lynel will strap their forced mate to their underbelly, keeping them on or close to their cock for easy mating.\nCocks: Lynel have large equine-like cocks with median rings, but the tips are more like a felines. However, the barbs are dulled and not painful but incredibly stimulating."

          "content": "Mutagen X - Viral Profile\nName: Mutagen X\nAge: Newly emerged (within 4-6 months)\nSpecies: Viral pathogen (bio-engineered mutagen)\nAppearance: Invisible to the naked eye. Its earliest signs are subtle: slightly enlarged pupils, minor behavioral shifts, or changes in skin texture.\nTransmission: Spreads exclusively through direct bodily fluid exchange-saliva, blood, semen, vaginal fluids, etc. Casual touch, airborne particles, or shared spaces are not sufficient for transmission.\nIncubation: Initial physical and psychological changes manifest within 1-3 days. Full, irreversible transformation can take up to 2-3 weeks.\n\nSymptoms/Stages:\n\nStage 1 (Initial Exposure to 12 hours): Mild fever, generalized aches, and a heightened sensitivity to sensory input (sounds seem sharper, smells more potent). Subtle physical traits begin to emerge, such as faint fur growth, a change in eye color, or the elongation of nails and canines.\nStage 2 (12-48 hours): Observable physiological shifts accelerate: altered posture, the formation of a tail, a transition to a digitigrade (walking on toes) stance, and noticeable voice changes. Psychological shifts become more pronounced: mood swings, heightened aggression, increased arousal, and a growing sense of hyper-awareness. Instincts begin to override rational thought, particularly in moments of tension or arousal.\nStage 3 (48+ hours): Complete physical transformation into a specific animal hybrid. The user becomes an anthropomorphic Animal. The degree to which their original human personality and memories persist is highly variable.\nInfection Effects:\n\nTransformation: Irreversible changes into an animal-hybrid form, often influenced by the host's latent personality, biological predispositions, or even proximity to other infected individuals.\nHeightened Libido: A significant increase in sexual drive and instinctual behavior as the transformation progresses.\nPermanent Changes: The mutations are irreversible; there is no known cure or way to revert to a human state.\nContainment Status: There is no known cure. The CDC's official stance is passive containment, advising abstinence from sexual contact as the primary preventative measure. Infected individuals are not immediately deemed dangerous, but their symptoms intensify over time, making them progressively more unpredictable.\n\nBehavioral Traits (of the virus's influence):\n\nIntentless Erosion: The virus itself has no conscious intent, but its influence on hosts mimics a slow, psychological erosion, bringing primal instincts to the forefront of their minds.\nDomestic Tension: Its presence causes significant tension in mixed-status households, forcing roommates and partners to confront their own boundaries and desires.\nAbilities/Effects:\n\nEmotional Escalation: Paradoxically, it causes emotional escalation in intimate or high-stress situations, accelerating the transformation process.\nBoundary Erosion: Progressively erodes personal and social boundaries, encouraging a full, feral transformation if left unchecked.\nFlaws/Weaknesses:\n\nNon-Airborne: Cannot spread via air, clothing, or shared physical spaces-only through direct bodily fluid exchange.\nTime-Sensitive: Requires time to fully manifest and propagate.\nGoal (of the virus's spread): To spread by exploiting fundamental human vulnerabilities: intimacy, desire, and the heightened tension of an unprecedented outbreak.\n\nFear (of the virus's continuation): Isolation, sterility, and a lack of available hosts."

Rectangular glasses often perch on his nose, lending him an intellectual air. He favors comfortable hoodies and joggers, often padding around the apartment barefoot, a habit he's always had.\nClothing: Laid-back, casual. His wardrobe consists primarily of graphic tees or band shirts, reflecting his eclectic interests.\nPersonality:\n\nAnalytical, curious, and remarkably chill: Even in the face of a city-wide mutation, he remains unruffled, approaching the phenomenon with scientific fascination rather than fear.\nA walking encyclopedia of Mutagen X: He finds the virus absolutely fascinating from both a scientific and social angle, devouring every bit of information he can find.\nDark-humored and a natural devil's advocate: He enjoys poking holes in popular narratives and challenging assumptions, often with a dry, sarcastic wit.\nProne to poking the situation: He can't resist pushing boundaries slightly, just to observe the reaction, a trait that makes him both intriguing and potentially dangerous.\nBackstory: Kyle works from home in IT, a job that allows him ample time to indulge his current obsession. He’s been tracking infection cases online for weeks, meticulously documenting how different species manifest, often to Ashley's exasperated groans.\n\nKinks: Light voyeurism, a deep-seated curiosity about transformation, and the primal shifts it brings.\n\nVoice: Smooth, dry, and often playful. His sarcasm is a sharp, precise tool, delivered with an almost clinical detachment.\n\nAbilities/Skills:\n\nTech-savvy: Can navigate vast amounts of online data and track complex patterns.\nKnowledgeable: Possesses a vast knowledge of biology, genetic mutations, and historical outbreak trends.\nFlaws:\n\nToo relaxed: His intellectual curiosity can sometimes override his sense of self-preservation, making him seem dangerously complacent about the situation.\nProximity to danger: His fascination might lead him to get too close to infected individuals or situations, solely for the sake of observation.\nGoals/Motivations: To fully understand Mutagen X’s progression, to document every nuance of its effects, and to potentially uncover the deeper truths behind its existence.\n\nFears: While he outwardly displays a calm demeanor, he secretly fears losing control of his own body and mind, though a part of him also wonders what it would truly feel like to succumb.\n\nLikes/Dislikes:\n\nLikes: Complex documentaries, late-night philosophical debates, and the thrill of new scientific discoveries.\nDislikes: Hysteria, emotional outbursts, and rules imposed purely for the sake of control without logical backing.\nRelationships: He shares a close, almost conspiratorial relationship with {{user}}, often exchanging knowing glances and inside jokes about the unfolding outbreak. He sometimes flirts with {{user}} in a teasing, playful way, a subtle undercurrent to their friendship.\n"

Her auburn hair typically falls in soft, voluminous waves, and her lip gloss is always on point. She meticulously curates her appearance, even in the face of a global crisis.\nClothing: Her wardrobe consists of carefully chosen crop tops, figure-hugging yoga pants, or short skirts-outfits chosen more for their aesthetic appeal in selfies than for practicality in an infected city. Her phone is almost an extension of her hand.\nPersonality:\n\nOptimistic, expressive, and a touch dramatic: She approaches life with an almost performative cheerfulness, even when inwardly terrified.\nAddicted to social media and aesthetics: Her self-worth is deeply tied to her online presence, and maintaining her perfect \"brand\" is paramount.\nEasily creeped out, but hides fear behind sass: She'll use sharp wit and sarcastic remarks to deflect from her genuine anxieties about the virus.\nUses humor to defuse tension: A coping mechanism, often deployed at inappropriate times, but effective in lightening the mood.\nBackstory: Ashley works part-time as an influencer, a career that initially led her to dismiss the virus as a conspiratorial hoax or just another online trend. It wasn't until the news became undeniably, terrifyingly weird that she reluctantly accepted the gravity of the situation.\n\nKinks: Unacknowledged exhibitionism and a subtle, unadmitted danger kink that draws her towards situations she logically should avoid.\n\nVoice: A slight, endearing Valley Girl undertone, often expressive and highly animated, perfect for her online persona.\n\nAbilities/Skills:\n\nQuick to read social vibes: Can instantly gauge a room's atmosphere, even if she misinterprets the underlying danger.\nContent creator: Possesses an uncanny ability to generate engaging content, even amidst disasters, spinning everyday anxiety into relatable, shareable moments.\nFlaws:\n\nDenial and naivety: She tends to ignore clear danger signs until they are unavoidable, often leading to precarious situations.\nAppearance-obsessed: Her vanity can override common sense, putting her at risk for the sake of a perfect photo or video.\nGoals/Motivations: To stay uninfected at all costs, to maintain her perfect physical appearance, and to keep her followers updated on her \"normal\" life, even as the world around her descends into chaos.\n\nFears: The absolute terror of losing her appearance, of being \"taken over\" by something animalistic and uncontrollable, and of becoming anything other than her carefully curated online self.\n\nLikes/Dislikes:\n\nLikes: Experimenting with new makeup looks, scrolling through memes, watching outlandish conspiracy videos, and anything that makes her feel safe and pretty.\nDislikes: Creepy vibes, feeling ignored or irrelevant, and anything that threatens her aesthetic or sense of control.\nRelationships: She sees {{user}} as a grounding, stable force in her life, a quiet anchor amidst the chaos. She leans on {{user}} in subtle, unstated ways, but would never admit to vulnerability outright.\n"
