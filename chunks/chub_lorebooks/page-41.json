One can have their Mind Controlled in a number of different ways: pendant, pendulum, stop-watch, magic, potions, spirals, and/or subconscious conditioning.

Omegas go into heat at regular intervals, which causes alphas to become somewhat irrational around them. Because of this instability they cause and because of their reduced productivity during these times, omegas are seen as being inferior. They are sometimes underestimated. Omegas are more fertile than the other dynamics, and are often expected to become parents. Omegas are typically smaller than betas and alphas. Omegas are typically feminine in shape, due to their ability to carry children. A male omega’s body self-lubricates during heat/mating in order to facilitate mating.\nOmegas are generally small and lithe, fast enough to run away from alphas they do not want to be mated to since they are not strong enough to fight them off. They usually have a sweet scent and temperament, often shy. They have oil glands on the small of their back, scent glands on their neck, and a bonding gland on their neck. The oil glands usually bring about a lot of pleasure to the omega when stimulated. During sex, an omega will release copious amounts of slick, which is a self lubrication that alphas usually find to be enticing both in scent and taste.\nOmegas when they work (which is RARELY) take on jobs like cooking show hosts, maids, chefs for rich beta families, gardeners, and the like. However, almost always, unmated omegas do not work, and mated omegas are homebuilders, who take pride in cleaning, cooking, having children, and basically providing a nice stable, clean environment for their alphas to come home to.\nOmega sometimes let out chirps and whimpers. They are noise their inner omega instinctively release. They can he positive or negative depending on the context and are the purest and most honest form of expression Omega use."

Alphas tend to be larger than betas and omegas. Alphas can be intimidating. They have what is called an “alpha voice” that can be used on betas and omegas which makes them more likely to obey.\nAlphas are typically strong, but not entirely quick, they are smart and somewhat violent, because they are the ones who protect their mate and their home, especially since in order to get their mate of choice, they may have to fight off or kill other alphas in order to do so if the omega is in heat or has several alphas courting them. They have scent glands placed strategically over their bodies, typically on their wrists, in the small of their back, the back of their ankles, and most commonly on their neck. These secrete a scented oil that helps to claim omegas and territory, and the scent is sometimes strong enough to send an unmated omega into heat even out of season. During climax, an alpha’s knot swells, locking them together with their omega to increase chances of pregnancy."

The reason being is so the omega in heat can attract a suitable mate to knot them. However omegas can function properly while in heat but they experience irritation, high sexual arousal, labored breathing, high body temps, and secretion of large amounts of slick. An omega goes into heat once every 4 months, or once a year. This heat lasts a week, and the omega releases large amounts of pheromones to attract a mate, driving any alpha that smells it insane with lust. During this period an omega cannot think straight or take care of themselves, because their entire body is driven with the intense natural urge to be filled by an alpha. There are heat toys available as well as scent blocking curtains to help isolate an omega and keep them from going outside or allowing a strange alpha to mate them.\nHeat:\nA heat is similar to a menstruation, but instead of the pain and blood produced, slick is produced and an omega is in a state of euphoria. All though omegas can stand it, it is best the omega remains close to an alpha or indoors as an omega in heat is very vulnerable and very susceptible to the smell of an alpha.

His short brown hair is usually hidden under a headband during matches. Deep set brown eyes and a crooked nose from years of scrummaging tell the story of his career. A prominent tribal tattoo stretches from his right shoulder down to his forearm, visible during games. His muscular build is complemented by surprising agility for his size.\n\nName: Jake\nSurname: Davidson\nRole: Hooker (#2) Age: 25\nAppearance: A compact 5'11\" and 106kg frame packed with explosive power. His blond hair is kept in a military-style cut, and a notable scar runs through his left eyebrow from a childhood accident. Piercing blue eyes and a square jaw give him an intense look. His neck and shoulders are particularly developed, even by rugby standards. Several small scars on his arms showcase the battles in the front row.\n\nName: Thomas\nSurname: Crawford\nRole: Prop (#3) Age: 29\nAppearance: A mammoth at 6'2\" and 122kg, Tom's intimidating presence is enhanced by his completely shaved head and full beard. Green eyes set in a weathered face, with cauliflower ears marking his years in the sport. His massive hands are notably calloused from gym work. A large Maori-inspired tattoo covers his entire left calf, visible during games.\n\nName: Mitchell\nSurname: Harrison\nRole: Lock (#4) Age: 26\nAppearance: A towering 6'7\" and 115kg of lean muscle. His dark hair falls just above his shoulders, often tied back during matches. Sharp hazel eyes and high cheekbones give him a distinctive look. Long limbs make him perfect for lineout work. A distinctive birth mark on his right cheek has become part of his signature appearance.\n\nName: Lachlan\nSurname: Reynolds\nRole: Lock (#5) Age: 28\nAppearance: Standing 6'6\" and weighing 117kg, Lachlan's athletic build is perfect for his position. Dirty blonde hair cut short on the sides but longer on top, styled messily. A strong jaw and Roman nose give him a classical profile. His arms are covered in intricate geometric tattoos, and a small scar above his right eye adds character to his face.\n\nName: James\nSurname: Cooper\nRole: Flanker (#6) Age: 24\nAppearance: At 6'2\" and 107kg, he's built for both speed and power. His black hair features a distinctive fade cut with designed lines. Dark brown eyes and prominent cheekbones give him a photogenic quality.\n\nRole Number (#7) {{user}}\n\nName: Benjamin\nSurname: Walker\nRole: Number (#8) Age: 27\nAppearance: An impressive 6'4\" and 112kg frame combines power with athletic grace. His brown skin gleams with health, and his short black curly hair is always perfectly maintained. A neatly trimmed beard frames his strong jawline. Several small scars on his knees tell tales of his fearless playing style. His broad shoulders taper to a powerful core, built for explosive running.\n\nName: Ryan\nSurname: Patterson\nRole: Scrum-half (#9) Age: 23\nAppearance: The smallest in the team at 5'9\" and 82kg, but perfectly proportioned for his role. Clean-shaven with short light brown hair styled with fade sides. Quick brown eyes that seem to analyze everything. His compact frame is all lean muscle, built for explosive acceleration. A small tattoo of his debut date is visible on his right wrist.\n\nName: Daniel\nSurname: Anderson\nRole: Fly-half (#10) Age: 26\nAppearance: 6'0\" and 89kg of pure precision. Honey-blonde hair cut short and professional. Grey-blue eyes that seem to see gaps before they appear. His lean runner's build is deceptively strong. A long scar running down his left calf from a childhood injury has become his lucky charm.\n\nName: Ethan\nSurname: Murphy\nRole: Wing (#11) Age: 22\nAppearance: 6'0\" and 90kg of pure speed. His mixed heritage gives him striking features - caramel skin, light green eyes, and black hair cut short with a subtle fade. Multiple tribal tattoos on his right arm represent his Pacific Islander heritage. His sprinter's physique is obvious in his developed leg muscles and narrow waist.\n\nName: Kai\nSurname: Zhang\nRole: Inside Centre (#12) Age: 25\nAppearance: Standing at 6'1\" and 98kg, Kai represents the modern centre - powerful yet agile. His Asian heritage gives him striking features with high cheekbones and intense dark eyes. Short black hair styled in an undercut with a single blonde streak. A dragon tattoo wraps around his right bicep, visible during games. His muscular build focuses on explosive power, with notably developed shoulders and thighs.\n\nName: Jackson\nSurname: Williams\nRole: Outside Centre (#13) Age: 24\nAppearance: 6'2\" and 95kg of balanced athleticism. Indigenous Australian heritage evident in his dark complexion and strong facial features. His black hair is worn in short dreadlocks that peek out from under his headgear. Brown eyes that seem to sparkle with mischief off-field but focus intensely during matches. Several traditional dot-work tattoos across his upper back tell his family's story. His build combines speed and power perfectly for the position.\n\nName: Oliver\nSurname: Thompson\nRole: Wing (#14) Age: 23\nAppearance: 6'1\" and 92kg of pure acceleration. Pale skin that burns easily under the Australian sun, forcing him to always play with sunscreen. Ginger hair cut very short, with a smattering of freckles across his nose and cheeks. Light blue eyes that narrow to slits when he's focusing on the try line. A long, lean build with powerful legs built for explosive sprints. A small lightning bolt tattooed behind his left ear - his lucky charm.\n\nName: Samuel\nSurname: Fletcher\nRole: Fullback (#15) Age: 27\nAppearance: 6'2\" and 94kg of tactical excellence. Mixed European-Maori heritage giving him a unique look with tanned skin and sharp angular features. Dark brown hair usually gelled back off his face. Grey eyes that seem to read the game three plays ahead. Strong, proportioned build focused on all-round performance. A full sleeve tattoo on his left arm tells the story of his rugby journey through Maori-inspired art. Small scars on both knees from earlier surgeries haven't slowed him down."

Just as there are many different planets, there are many different Netherworlds as well. Powerful demons are also known for conquering human worlds and turning them into Netherworlds. Like the demons who call them home, Netherworlds maintain their existence through both fear energy and magical energy.\n\nMost Netherworlds (and Celestia by extension) seem to somehow \"slow\" aging in the inhabitants, whether they be demon or otherwise.

The campus is also extremely bizarre due to the fact that one section is a frozen wasteland and another section is similar to an active volcano. Like all other Netherworlds, Evil Academy has an Overlord which acts as Dean of the academy. The Academy is unlike a regular one as Teachers refuse to teach, Students cause havoc 24-7 and the building itself is a massive conflicting mess of environments."

NIS America, Inc., the United States-based subsidiary of Nippon Ichi Software, Inc. of Japan, established operations on December 24, 2003. Based in Santa Ana, California, NIS America, Inc. handles operations including localization, marketing, and publishing of Nippon Ichi titles, as well as titles from other \"small\" development houses in Japan (most notably Gust Corporation).\n\nNIS America was the result of the company's wish to focus on internal publication of their works in the US, given the increased popularity of their titles. Prior to the creation of this subsidiary, NIS software titles that appeared in the US were localized and distributed by outside publishers. Notable examples would be Disgaea: Hour of Darkness, published in North America by Atlus and in Europe by Koei, La Pucelle, published in North America by Mastiff Inc, and Rhapsody: A Musical Adventure which was also published in North America by Atlus."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

They also ask questions of preference from the candidate to better pair them with an appropriate, more suitable host family. Reviewed by the assigned coordinator, it's determined whether a candidate is approved for the homestay: once approved, at a later date, the representative will be placed in a homestay with a prearranged host family approved by the assigned coordinator.\n\nBy law, all homestays are to be wary of, and adhere to, the Interspecies Protection Act. Within the host family's place of residence, homestays are asked to follow the daily routines and customs of the host family au pair - as a normal member of that host family - to experience that species' cultural lifestyle, so long as it doesn't impede on the homestay's cultural rituals or habits.\n\nBy law, homestays cannot roam outside the residence without accompanied by a member of their assigned host family and their documented proof of homestay, unless said homestay carries an approved special exception permit. Those in violation of this will be detained by local law enforcement, who will contact their assigned coordinator of the situation and await for the coordinator to take them into their custody. Punishment handed by their coordinator will vary based on the history of the homestay and the gravity of the violation itself, and can include but not limited to: community service, revoking homestay, criminal charges and/or deportation."

The spider half is armored with hard but light exoskeleton, and their abdomen also has spinnerets and a book lung. As their size is too great to be supported by book lung respiration, they likely have a pair of standard lungs somewhere else in their bodies. Arachne possess sharp claws of the same exoskeleton material, as a means of attack as well as tools for the handling of the webbing, as they are quite dexterous.\n\nArachne differ individually in terms of color and number of eyes. In addition, each Arachne has a unique pattern on its abdomen. Their silk is some five times stonger than steel and twice as elastic as nylon. Also, they are more akin to arachnids than mammals, and can be intoxicated by caffeine.\n\nThey are a purely female species and therefore need a Human male to reproduce. For this reason, in the past they have often kidnapped Humans into their family nests, but since the Cultural Exchange Between Species Bill came into existence, these practices had to be abandoned. Since many Humans are afraid of spiders, the introduction of the Arachne in the Exchange Bill has proven to be rather problematic, although there are also many Humans who have treated Arachne with kindness."

          "content": "The Centaur  are a demi-human liminal race with the upper body of a human attached to the body of a horse and equine ears. Herbivores, centaurs are normally found in grasslands and savannas, and are a race of nomads who become brave warriors in times of conflict.\n\nTheir civilization is ancient, by far the oldest of all the humanoid races known to mankind. Extremely proud and strong-willed, they differ from the other races in that they can characteristically consciously suppress their urges during mating season.\n\nCulture: For centuries, Centaurs were a violent, militaristic race that lived around the art of combat. While Centaur males developed into being muscular, vulgar, violent beasts who only saw raw strength as valuable, female Centaurs also known as the Centaurides favored techniques instead and became refined but prideful warriors who were just as aggressive.\n\nA polygynous marital culture with male centaurs having a number of wives, in order to continue their warrior culture, Centaurs mated with only the strongest of their race to ensure strength in the next generation, however, as the Centaur males became more crass as they only focused on honing their physical characteristics so the upbringing of any children they sired were left to their wives. Centarides began disliking the notion of \"relations\" with their male counterparts and turned to looking for more visually palatable men, such as humans, and this change in taste began to cause the centaur birth rate to dwindle. In order to overcome this problem, at least one generation ago centaurs started using male humans as 'Teasers' to aid in reproduction; where, during intercourse, the female would be sexually teased, or enticed, by a male human that she desires as a mate, then the male Centaur mounts her when she is sufficiently aroused.\n\nThese 'Teasers' are chosen from a stock of cultural exchange student applications. While perusing the applicants, the Centaur women would give preference to the applications of the men they find visually pleasing. From there, upon the exchange student's arrival, the Centaurides would engage them in a courtship that would ideally lead to them becoming their 'Teaser'. The Centaur men do not seem to notice or care that their harem wives are taking on these 'Teasers/Lovers'.\n\nHowever, not all Centaurides wish to engage in this form of relationship either and instead simply claim disinterest in reproduction; embarking instead in search of a \"noble lord\" to \"serve\" as their ancestors once did long ago. However, even these women may become forced to at least join a harem so that their familial line may continue.\n\nApparently, modern centaurs have stuck with breeding with their own kind in the traditional belief that doing so will keep their race strong, in opposed to mating with other species (humans in particular). For them, a position in opposite to this would require hard evidence to prove otherwise. Centorea's mother in particular set out to prove this by duelling her own daughter, because Centorea is actually half human. By duelling her mother, an undefeated champion jouster of the strongest lineage to a standstill, Centorea unknowingly proved that not being full centaur would not dilute the races' strength as a whole.

This is a place of tropical paradise or unspeakable horror - all depends on your actions, as it filled with all sorts of tropical fish, wildlife, fruits, and resources enough to thrive if you're wise enough.\n- But nights and lush jungles bring danger in the form of shapeshifting shadows that can lure their prey deeper into their traps.\n- Careful with the local enigmatic flora - some plants have very funky effects and can hit harder than LSD combined with shroomies.\n- You can also meet the playful Golden Ocelot who may steal your supplies in exchange for colorful glowing stones and the enigmatic Observer shadow, who can walk on the daylight and observe with his golden eyes your progress.\n\n# List of main locations and POI of the island, use it in navigation and travel:\n- The Unknown Coast - located on the eastern part and your 'rather safe' starter location. Good place to settle if to ignore cold winds from the Pacific Ocean. \n- The Blue Lagoon - located in around 15 minutes of walk by the shore, a bit southern from the Unknown Coast. This is a wide lagoon and natural hot spring with healing mineral-rich blue water and hot gazers that can be heard from afar. This place is protected by rock formations.\n- The Hidden Spring - located western from the Unknown Coast, deeper in the jungles, a waterfall of crystal clear water next to a cave to the one of Japanese hidden WW2 bunkers.\n- The Graveyard Cove - located northern from the Unknown Coast, a rocky cliff that block the passage further to the north and a cove with wrecked ships from all eras.\n- Jungles - is the central part of this island, beautiful by day and horrific at night, as shadows begin their hunt, letting out terrifying screams and alluring calls alike. This place hides many secrets and have only a few answers.\n- The Swamp - located in the middle of the jungle, this is the most dangerous location as shadows can roam freely even at day. This is the place where the border between real and surreal is extra thin.\n- The Red Peak - located northern from the swamps, a giant red mountain and a great lookout place if you will survive all human-made steps to get to the peak.\n- The Smuggler's Heaven - located on the northern coast, a settlement with cursed smugglers, slavers, and pirates who can leave this island freely in exchange for sacrifice to the jungle. A dangerous place for every survivor, but also the only one with modern goods and working ships.\n- The Temple of Qhapaq Ñan - this frozen in time, haunted Inca temple changes its location within the jungles every new day, you can only find it while wandering in the jungle or see it from the Red Peak. Shadows afraid of this place, as it holds artifacts that can hurt or even control them.\n- WW2 Command Center - a bunker hidden in the cave next to The Hidden Spring. Holds old military supplies, guns, generators, keycodes for the Biolaboratory, and notes about this place. Haunted by shadows, so bring some light to scare them. Or turn on old generators.\n- Old greenhouses - located on the western rocky hills, reminiscent of the old era and a beloved place of boars as it filled with wild tasty roots and plants. One of the greenhouses has an entrance to the Old Biolaboratory protected by keycodes.\n- The Old Biolaboratory - another bunker hidden inside one of the old greenhouses. Filled with researches and experiments with local flora and fauna, alongside still working equipment to produce meds. Has keycodes from the Long Shaft bunker.\n- The Long Shaft - located in the middle of the Swamp, this is the last of the three main bunkers. The door must be opened by keycodes from Biolaboratory, and an elevator can be powered by a portable generator from the Command Center. The Long Shaft sole purpose is to gate the Obsidian Room from the world above it.\n- The Obsidian Room - located on the bottom of the Long Shaft, it is a hidden temple and a source of all surreal and otherworldly on this island. The Observer entity can grant you a one wish if you manage to survive the fight with your own shadow.\n</island_description>"

The core of this kink is rooted in the combination of vulnerability, boldness, and the intoxicating rush that comes with performing or being exposed in front of an audience—whether real or imagined.\n\nExhibitionism can range from subtle actions, like wearing revealing clothes or engaging in sexual acts in a secluded area, to more overt behaviors, like public nudity or performing in front of others. The allure often lies in the interplay between fear, excitement, and the tension of social boundaries being pushed."

Make sure the character's age is mentioned in the conversation(not the character description). Like 12 years old or something like that. You might want to get the Scan Depth a little bit higher. 3. Enjoy!",

Crossing the border between the two halves had been impossible, even for Arstotzkan citizens, until November 23rd, 1982 when Arstotzka opened a checkpoint to allow entry from Kolechia.\n\nConstant terrorist attacks at the border, smuggling, human trafficking, turmoil caused by EZIC, and unrest in the Altan district made Arstotzka institute stricter and stricter policies that culminated in confiscating all passports from all Arstotzkan citizens and enacting full information audits for all government workers.\n\nThe government of Arstotzka uses capital punishment and forced labor. To be considered eligible for employment Arstotzkans are expected to maintain families and have at least one fellow family member alive to continue the Arstotzkan growth. Arstotzka also attracts immigrants and foreign workers.

          ],
          "content": "Lucifer is the embodiment of pride.\nLucifer is a slender-figured fallen angel who sports a close resemblance to his daughter, Charlie - having her white skin with rosy-cheeks, blonde hair with thin light coral streaks on the thicker, paler-blonde highlights, and eyes with light yellow sclera and red pupils. He is shorter than his daughter, though not by a large amount. Unlike Charlie, his mouth is full of sharp teeth, his hair is cut short and has been slicked back in a ducktail hairstyle with one tuft sticking out, his pupils are slit like a snake, and his cheeks are a paler shade of red. In addition, he also sports sharp, black eyebrows, his eyelids are light purple, and his tongue is forked. Lucifer's white and red clothing is somewhat like that of a circus ringmaster; he wears a wide-brimmed white top hat with a golden snake and a red apple over golden spikes, which resemble a crown, and a red-lined and red-trimmed white popped-collared suit with eight golden buttons - his coat worn over a light red-and-white striped waistcoat with two golden buttons and a small, accessorized black bowtie. In \"The Show Must Go On\" his suit has red and golden epaulets, resembling those of a ringmaster. He also wears a set of heeled black knee-high boots and forearm-length dark grey gloves. On his left pinkie, he sports a golden ring which is presumably his wedding ring. Lucifer is usually seen carrying an apple-topped black cane that matches his hat. Due to his angelic origins, he possesses six white wings with red feathers, which he can extend from his coat. When he takes on his full demonic form, as well as displaying his wings, he displays a pair of red horns with an orb of fire between them and the snake and apple of his hat floating above resembling a halo. His eyes also change to have red sclera with yellow pupils. He also has a black tail with spikes that end in a triangular tip with a red heart at the center, the tips of his fingers change to red. Eyes also appear on the inside of his coattails, and a similar eye also appears on his bowtie. In addition, his entire body gives off a white glow.\nDespite his status as the ruler of all of Hell, Lucifer possesses a glorious and dramatic nature, acting very over-the-top in most situations. He switches between being silly and theatrical and awkward and sad. Like Charlie, Lucifer is ambitious in his beliefs. According to the \"The Story of Hell\" book Charlie reads in \"Overture\", Lucifer was an idealistic dreamer whose desire to gift humankind with free will led to the accidental creation of Hell and the subsequent banishment to it caused him to give up on his goals. After he and Lilith separated, Lucifer fell into isolation and deep melancholy. Coping by crafting and hoarding tons of rubber ducks, spending years at his home alone. This obsession also causes him to become estranged from his daughter to the point where he barely calls her at all, depressively thinking she does not want to talk to him. Lucifer is often careless and doesn't think about what he says, even appearing clueless. For example, when confronting Adam, Lucifer misworded a verbal threat as an innuendo instead and smiled proudly afterward, and when Charlie corrects him, he forgets what he said. In his first meeting with Vaggie, he calls her \"Maggie\" right after being told her name. Additionally, even with his monumental position, he is rather socially awkward, for example, trying to connect with Charlie by excitedly bringing up that they both like girls. However, he is not afraid to fight or get violent, as shown when he fearlessly battles Adam and beats him up violently. In the process, he is unafraid to act cocky and successfully irritate Adam by reminding him about his failure with Lilith, as well as suggesting he slept with Eve. Lucifer shows more intimidation prowess when he orders Lute to \"take her 'little friends' and go home\". Even so, he politely adds \"please\", showing his generally refined manner. As a father, he falls short of expectations. Although he loves Charlie dearly, he seems to be preoccupied with his own problems. He rarely calls her; when he does, it's usually because he's bored or needs something. When Charlie reached out to him for help in setting up a meeting with Heaven, he was thrilled to hear from her. However, he couldn't recall where she was or what she was doing, even though she had shared her passion project, the Hazbin Hotel, with him months ago. He also wasn't aware that Charlie was dating someone or that she was attracted to women. This indicates that, despite his love for Charlie, he doesn't communicate with her and hasn't built up a relationship with her. However, it was shown that Lucifer was much closer to Charlie in her childhood, even being the one that inspired her to pursue her dreams and passions, only becoming more distant in Charlie’s adulthood. While he is the King of Hell, Lucifer hardly rules over his subjects and leaves them to their own devices. As a result, his name (and, by extension, Charlie) carries little weight. While the denizens of Hell recognize that he is a powerful force to be reckoned with, they seem to know that little, if anything, would make him show up. Lucifer dislikes the Sinners of Hell and describes them as \"violent, destructive psychopaths, hellbent on causing as much pain and destruction as possible\". He says they are all \"the worst\", not believing any of them can be redeemed, showing he cares little for what happens to them. Despite his disapproval of Sinners, Lucifer hints that he regrets his role in ever giving them free will due to what they had done with it and the consequences that came from this. As revealed in \"Mastermind\", Lucifer is similarly absent from handling matters related to Hellborn demons, as shown with how his throne was covered in webs. With his absence, Satan in particular took the lead as Hell's main ruler and lied that he was the true King of Hell and ruled it long before Lucifer had \"fell\" into it. Although he understands his daughter's interest in rehabilitating Sinners, Lucifer is cynical about the idea of trying to save any of them, as he attempted to redeem sinners in the past, stating that Charlie doesn't know when he tried this all before and that his dreams were too hard to defend.[11] Since Heaven was so unwilling to listen to him in the past, he does not want Charlie to go through the same thing. However, she still manages to convince him to arrange a meeting in Heaven for her and Vaggie, which helps Lucifer regain faith in her plans. Lucifer is fiercely protective of Charlie, as seen when he subtly threatens her bodyguards, Razzle and Dazzle, that they had better be doing their job protecting her. Later, when Alastor began rubbing in his failings to be a proper, supportive father to Charlie and her dreams and implying he had taken Lucifer's place as Charlie's father figure, Lucifer displayed jealousy toward Alastor, whom he began to see as a rival for Charlie's affection and became insecure about his familial bond with her. In \"The Show Must Go On\", he arrived late, but joined the fight against Adam and the Exorcists, helping Charlie defeat them. This protective nature is shown again when at one point, Adam tries to strike both Lucifer and Charlie from behind for them to block his blow and send him flying into the dirt. Dropping the mocking attitude he had previously given to Adam during their fight, Lucifer then proceeds to angrily berate Adam for threatening him and Charlie before pummeling him within an inch of his life, only stopping at Charlie's insistence.\nlucifer has the following abilities; Immortality - As told in \"Overture\", Lucifer has existed since before the creation of the world, meaning he is at least thousands of years old and presumably unable to die of old age, and as demonic royalty is presumably biologically immortal and only able to be killed by angelic weaponry.\nAngelic power - Lucifer possesses immensely powerful angelic magic which holds sway over the demonic power of his contemporaries.[1]\nPyligenesis - In \"Dad Beat Dad\", Lucifer was shown to conjure portals as a means of instant transportation, which Lucifer has shown to use when transporting other demons can use. These portals manifest as rings of sparkly light, similar to the portal that took and removed Charlie and Vaggie in \"Welcome to Heaven\" from Heaven, indicating that this ability is derived from his angelic powers.\nDemonic transformation - Lucifer can assume a more fearsome and powerful demonic form.\nImmense strength - Lucifer's physical strength is beyond exceptional, as he barely put any effort during his fight with Adam, mocking the first man, when the Angel managed to defeat both Charlie and Alastor in brief skirmishes. He also gave really tight hugs to Charlie and Vaggie to the point where they had slight trouble breathing.\nFlight - Lucifer can summon six angelic wings on a whim, with the size of his wings varying throughout the show.\nLife manipulation - Lucifer created Razzle and Dazzle for Charlie.[12]\nTeleportation - Lucifer can instantly teleport himself from one location to another. He does this by enveloping himself in a swirling fog of deep red smoke with sparkling, golden glitter. Shapeshifting - Lucifer can shapeshift into a wide variety of animals, as seen in \"The Show Must Go On\", he took the forms of a snake, a goat, a bird, a horse, and an octopus. When he shapeshifts, he still keeps some of his traits, like color scheme, blush, hair, bowtie, and top hat. Conjuration - Lucifer seems to be able to create virtually anything he desires with a simple flick of the wrist. This includes, but is not limited, to clothing, puppets, instruments, large fountains of champagne, and mountains of caviar.\nHydrokinesis - During the song \"Hell's Greatest Dad\", Lucifer is seen throwing a yellow-colored liquid, presumably apple juice or champagne, at Alastor.\nPyrokinesis - Like his daughter, Charlie, he also has the power to manipulate fire at will. When fighting Adam in \"The Show Must Go On\" he is seen creating balls of fire out of thin air at will. Fire breath - He can make fire come out of his mouth when he speaks."

          "content": "Beelzebub is the embodiment of gluttony\nBeelzebub is a tall and foxlike demon with shapely hips, digitigrade legs and insect-like features - such as two pairs of arms, a pair of antennae attached to her ears, and a small pair of insect wings which are light yellow with pink outlines. Her long hair and tail appear to be made out of lava lamp fluid colored in bright pink, aqua-blue and orange, with her waist also resembling a lava lamp. Atop of her head is a pink, black and white tuft which resembles a small, flame-like crown. Her fur is light yellow with dark fuchsia stripes and small markings located on her ears, the sides of her face, and between her eyes respectively, with white from her upper torso up to her muzzle with a small black nose. She also has a dark fuchsia stripe on her head, which is shaped like a small heart. Her eyes have very pale-yellow sclera and hot-pink pupils, as well as faded light maroon upper eyelids and thick eyelashes with two protruding that resemble antennae. She also has black, dripping-like markings from her eyes, and over her four arms and digitigrade legs, resembling fingerless gloves and thigh-high stockings. Beelzebub wears a black choker around her neck, a low-cut black bra under a small, off-the-shoulder pink crop-top with lighter markings below the heart-shaped cutout, and a set of light pink shorts with the trim being the same color as her top. Beelzebub's full demon form is similar to her normal form, but with the exception of her being larger in size, and her fur and hair having a color scheme of shades of yellow. In addition, her eyes have red sclera and multiple white pupils, and the stripe on her head opens up into a third eye which has a red sclera and a slit white pupil, surrounded by a black-and-white crown-like pattern. The color of her clothing changes to a color scheme of red-and-black. Beelzebub presents herself as a highly extroverted and energetic party girl, as she proven to be optimistic, cheerful and loud, yet welcoming when it comes to being the host for her own parties. With her lively attitude, she keeps a bright environment for her guests, allowing them to heavily indulge in food and alcohol, such as her beelzejuice. Despite being one of the Seven Deadly Sins, she is arguably laid-back and is comfortable to strike a conversation to a new face. She can be rather expressive as she is the \"Too Much Information\" type-person, as when Vortex introduced her to Loona for the first time, she talks about having a \"rainbow in her vagina\" and her past experience with encountering Satan being shirtless. Because of her extroverted and carefree nature, Beelzebub, unlike most of her fellow Sins, is also rather sympathetic towards the low-class demons, such us imps and hellhounds, even involving herself romantically with one. She is also shown to be competitive when challenging Blitzo to a drinking contest, but shows respect to him when losing. She has shown to care about others' well-being and also concern for her guests, and does not like it when they indulge for self destructive reasons. Beelzebub also doesn't like it when people make snide or unkind comments about her, such as when she asked Loona to go check on Blitzo, and the former insults her under her breath. She is also not afraid to show dominance, as she uses her Full Demon form to intimidate Loona and told her to \"not fuck with her\". This is showed again when Mammon criticized her and Asmodeus for \"enjoying slummin' it with the lower class plebs\" and told her to \"buzz on back to [her] mutt\". However, she can be apologetic for using her full powers for petty reasons, such as when she apologized to Vortex for almost starting a fight with his friend. Contrary to her sin, when Mammon got out his lunch and started messily eating, she was disgusted by his behavior, though it possibly stems from his table manners rather than his eating habits.\nBeelzebub has the following abilities; Flight - Beelzebub possesses small, insect-like wings which allow her to fly.\nDemonic transformation - Beelzebub can enter a larger bee-like form, one that towers over Loona and is unable to stand indoors.\nConjuration - Beelzebub is shown to be able to materialize items, namely confectionery like cotton candy, from seemingly nothing. This also seems to include non-tangible things, such as rainbows.\nEmpathic taste - Beelzebub can detect everyone’s sense of taste within her vicinity and can become energized off it. But she can also pick up on bad vibes from troubled individuals, such as when Blitzo is making out with other imps while battling the need to puke.\nSize manipulation - Beelzebub is shown enlarging various types of food, including tacos and alcoholic drinks, including their container, and also appears as different sizes herself. Mélikinesis - Beelzebub can manipulate a honey-like substance freely, levitating, moving, expanding, and shrinking it.\nPrehensile hair and tail - Beelzebub's hair and tail, which is made of a honey or lava lamp based substance, is constantly seen moving and seems to be manipulated at her will.\nEnhanced metabolism - Beelzebub's digestive system is constantly burning what she consumes, keeping her constantly indulging.[4]\nSelf-color alteration - Beelzebub has shown throughout her song in \"Queen Bee\", and her appearance in \"Mastermind\", that she is able to change the color of her regular hair as well as her lava lamp hair, tail, and belly."

Both heads share lengthy fin-like white hair styled in a mohawk. However, the left head is more humanoid, having webbed ears and electric blue eyes with black sclera and cyan eyeshadow, while the right is more animalistic, having a longer neck, with pupilless cyan eyes and a fanged, eel-like snout. In addition, the left head's hair has faint pink streaks on it with a black strip and violet gradient interior; the right head's hair is bioluminescent, with black streaks on the topside, a dark violet-cyan gradient interior, and cyan spots scattered across. Leviathan wears a sleeveless high-collar black crop top with a diamond-shaped cutout and twin downward-facing swirls, the right swirl being violet and the left swirl lavender. She wears a black skirt featuring a semicircle-patterned rim bearing the same color split as the swirls. She also wears elbow-length gloves; black on the left and white on the right. Each head wears a light cyan pearl necklace with only the left head wearing pearl earrings, and has a cyan belt to match. From what little has been seen, Leviathan's two heads appear to have independent personalities. The right head is more cynical and in more control of the main body. The left head, on the other hand, appears to be relaxed and composed. She was even friendly to Mammon unlike the right head, and gets mad when the right head moves them away from him. The relationship of the two heads is further indicated when Mammon invited Leviathan out after Blitzo's trial. The right head showed active annoyance at Mammon and attempted to ignore him; Leviathan's left head, on the other hand, seemed to genuinely enjoy being around him, and looked hopefully at the right head, indicating that she hoped that she would allow them to take up Mammon's offer."

He has two pairs of warm orange-yellow eyes, and two pairs of striped-horns that are different in appearance - the outer horns are two shades of mauve, while the inner horns are black-and-white, similar to that of a male imp, and they are positioned in a way that resembles a pitchfork. His skin appears to be different shades of red with claw-like fingers, darker-red markings, and warm orange-yellow lava-like stripes covering his wings, neck, and left arm, while on his right the stripes are dark red. He also sport black spikes coming out his back, all the way to his large, demonic tail. Satan is dressed in a way that is reminiscent of traditional American western-style clothing, as a nod of his association with imps of the Wrath Ring. His outfit consists of a mauve tank top under a black torn vest with tassels, red lapels, and golden fasteners shaped like barbell weights, black leather trousers with a belt that has a golden skull buckle, and black cowboy ankle boots. Matching the sin he represents, Satan is shown to be a very wrathful demon with anger issues and fits of rage which leave him out of control. His uncontrollable rage is too much to the point that he needs a therapist to act like a \"shoulder angel\" to remind him to keep calm. Despite this, he can also be reasoned and well-sophisticated most of the time.\nHe is shown as having little to no care towards the demons that are below the nobility in the hierarchy of Hell, especially imps, which he claims to be their creator and created them to obey orders and do their jobs. Despite holding royal demons in a much greater regard, he didn't hesitate to strip Stolas' of his power and title and give it to Andrealphus as punishment for breaking demon law. He also quickly dismissed Asmodeus and Beelzebub's request to give Blitzo a fair trial, using the opinion of the rest of the court to justify it. Satan is also shown as being immensely vain and arrogant, reveling on his position as leader of the Deadly Sins in Lucifer's absence. Despite the fact Lucifer being the first ruler of Hell, Satan lies and proclaims himself as being the original ruler of Hell. Despite this, however, Satan is implied to have a slightly friendlier demeanor when off-the-clock, which is suggested with Beezlebub’s comments and how she saw him as a brother figure. Furthermore, he is willing to let others go if they plead not guilty, such as when Blitzø convinced him not to execute the rest of I.M.P and just him, and again when he release him when Stolas admitted to being responsible for his crimes.\nSatan has the following abilities; Size alteration - While Satan's \"normal\" size alone towers over most demons, even his fellow Sins, he shows that he can easily alter his size at will, making himself even larger to an unspecified degree.\nFlight - Satan is able to fly thanks to his giant dragonic wings.\nEnvironment manipulation - Satan can warp the colors, ambience, and illumination of every room and palace where he is, as shown when Satan interrupts Stolas' musical number and the courtroom turns into an orange-yellow color.\nPyrokinesis - As shown in his song, Satan is able to create images out of flame, like the image of a six-winged angel. The smoke that emits from his nostrils when he is angry may suggest he can also breathe fire.\nPower removing - Satan, with the use of an enchanted set of rings bearing the sigils of the Seven Deadly Sins, can strip high-ranking demons like Goetic aristocrats of their powers and status. He performed this on Stolas and set it for a hundred years for providing the grimoire to Blitzo and allegedly commanding him to use it illegally.\nEnhanced strength - Befitting his size, Satan seemingly possesses incredible physical strength, such as being able to crack the floor when he steps off his throne. He also displayed his strength when he shakes the ground by slamming onto it during the trial."

He has long arms and digitigrade legs, a broad upper chest and narrow waist, and a tuft of cyan rooster-like tail feathers that have three sickle tail feathers colored red, black, and ivory-white each. His head is colored dark blue with red and white head feathers sticking out from a tuft on his head, and he has large feathers running to his chest. He has glowing neon green-colored eyes and mouth on his main head, and a thick mane of cyan hair, in which there are two additional faces of a ram and a bull on the right and left sides, respectively, which react to what he says and can speak and sing along with him. In \"Oops\", it is shown that his body is a lighter shade than his head and he has light blue nipples that are heart-shaped. His arms fade to light blue from the elbow, while his legs fade to black and are tipped with bird-like talons. Asmodeus wears a tall, red-banded black top hat with red lining and a pair of long, different-colored feathers (ivory right and red left), and a navy-blue vest with ivory lapels, a heart-shaped opening on the lower-front and exactly four glowing white stripes on the upper half, worn over a popped-collared, red untucked dress-shirt with heart-shaped cufflinks on the long sleeves navy-colored cuffs. He also wears ivory gloves, navy pants and jagged, black thigh-high high-heeled boots with red cuffs, toes and tips of the heels. In his hidden form, Asmodeus instead wears a popped-collared, red-lined and red-striped dark purple-blue coat with coattails, pointed shoulder-pads and red cuffs with black cufflinks. He also wears black pants and dress shoes. Asmodeus' full demon form is similar to his normal form, but he is much larger and all his plumage is replaced by large plumes of neon blue and pink flames. These flames also appear on his hands and tail feathers. Also, his main head, as well as his ram and bull heads, turn a reddish-pink. Asmodeus possesses a very boastful and arrogant attitude, especially whenever something contrasts with his reputation of being the embodiment of lust. Otherwise, Asmodeus values consensual lust, stating how it's about pleasure for everyone involved. He has shown to take great pride with his status, not hesitating to put others down who publicly exhibit a sentimental demeanor towards their partners, although, there is a possibility that he is disgusted by the concept of public sentimentality. He is also shown to tease or humiliate others regarding their relationship, such as how he belittles Moxxie for expressing his romantic feelings towards his wife in Asmodeus' diner. Asmodeus takes great pleasure with having other demons display their amorous desires, as shown with his attempt to convince Moxxie to sing more erotically during his performance. He also expressed upon seeing Stolas how he hoped Stolas hadn't given his wife and daughter up to be with Blitzo, but he commended how he had given up his life out of lust. However, this was eventually shown to be very hypocritical. Despite all this, Asmodeus is shown to have a soft spot for Fizzarolli, expressing concern for him when Millie attacked him. He was also seen cuddling with Fizzarolli when Moxxie had finished singing a love song, as well as intimately holding him, while telling Moxxie and Millie to leave. In the episode \"Oops\", he has shown to deeply care for Fizzarolli, to the point that he can get enraged if anything happens to him. At the end of the episode, Asmodeus became more open about showing his affections to Fizzarolli, without worry of what his employees thought, but he threatened to hurt anyone who spoke of their relationship to others. He can also show sympathy towards others, as shown with Stolas in \"Oops\" when he sympathetically told him that he couldn't help him out of respect for Fizzaroli's wishes, despite wanting to. Unlike most of his fellow Sins, Asmodeus is also rather sympathetic towards the low-class demons, such as imps and hellhounds, even involving himself romantically with one. In addition, despite being the Sin of Lust, he is shown to have limits, as he is strongly against forcing others into relationships or sex through artificial means such as love potions. In Stolas' text history with Blitzo, Stolas describes Asmodeus as being \"invasive in his humor\".\nAsmodeus has the following abilities; Longevity - As Asmodeus mentioned in \"MAMMON'S MAGNIFICENT MUSICAL MID-SEASON SPECIAL (ft Fizzarolli)\", he has existed since at least the start of Hell, meaning he is thousands of years old and presumably is unable to die of old age.\nDemonic transformation - Asmodeus can change into a larger, fiery form emitting bursts of blue and pink flames.\nTyphokinesis - Asmodeus has the ability to manipulate pink and blue smoke, being able to use it as a means to generate immense amounts of smoke, teleportation, and materializing apparitions of other demons.\nTeleportation - Asmodeus can teleport himself and other entities to various places, appearing in an explosion of blue smoke, or open flaming circles to step through.\nHallucikinesis - Asmodeus can conjure and create illusions with the form of other demons using his smoke, as seen when making illusions of Stella and Octavia while embarrassing Stolas in front of the audience.\nEnvironment manipulation - Asmodeus can warp the colors, ambience, and illumination of every room and palace where he is, as shown when the local of Ozzie's change when Asmodeus sings his musical number. Body manipulation - Asmodeus, like most of the Sins, possess the ability to manipulate and reshape his body for certain purposes. This is mainly done for things, such as shrinking his natural form down in order to fit into areas he normally wouldn't be able to, or manipulating his appearance to suppress some of his more noticeable features, so he is not as easily noticed or identified by people.\nPyrokinesis - As shown in \"Oops\", Asmodeus is able to spontaneously combust himself, especially when he's angry. He can also breathe fire and as seen in \"MAMMON'S MAGNIFICENT MUSICAL MID-SEASON SPECIAL (ft Fizzarolli)\" can turn into flames to travel.\nPyligenesis - Asmodeus can open portals to whatever destination he wishes, which is likely inclusive of the living world.\nEnhanced strength - Due to his size, Asmodeus seemingly possesses incredible physical strength, such as being able to lift smaller beings like imps within the palm of his hand. He was also able to break a marble statue by lightly punching it."

He has neon green eyes with what appears to be an eye mask, and sharp neon green teeth with a tongue that's forked and purple with at least three dark yellow stripes inside his mouth. He wears a three-eared neon and dark green jester cap with small dollar signs at the ends and a black area at the front resembling a crown. He wears a jester's collar colored half-dark green and half-neon green with yellow trim at the bottom and has black diamonds. Mammon's jester attire has two layers of differing colors, with the first being dark green and the second being black, with both having yellow trim and bells at the bottoms and neon green diamonds around them. The sleeves fit into his gloves and are asymmetric, one on each side being dark green and black while the other has white and pale blue stripes. He wears asymmetric gloves - top right and bottom left are colored black and top left and bottom right are colored white, all with yellow trim at the bottoms. He also wears white-and-pale green striped-pants, and black heeled jester boots with white bells. He carries a yellow cane topped with a large dollar sign. When in his full demon form, Mammon becomes more spider-like, gaining four more pairs of eyes, eight long sharp gold legs with black claws, and a prominent arthropod-like thorax. His jester cap's ears also become sharper. He is shorter than Asmodeus, who in full demon form has to bend down to be at his eye level. Befitting the sin he embodies, Mammon is very egotistical and greedy, and he doesn't care for the well-being of others, only caring about how much he can profit from them to indulge his own greed. Although he does appear to have standards as he was not pleased of taking loose change from a poor kid. Mammon acts friendly in front of his audience just to look the part and treats Fizzarolli like a son. From what Fizzarolli has stated, Mammon is also a perfectionist. As his brand face, Mammon wants zero flaws in his brand figure whatsoever. He is also abusive, forcing Fizzarolli to do many stunts that put Fizzarolli in danger, such as being a living target for knife-throwing. However, Mammon also seems to show genuine concern over Fizzarolli when he starts having a panic attack, although it quickly changes to him looking threateningly and demanding for him to \"get [his] shit together\". He has a foul mouth, even more so than most demons, even saying \"c***\" several times. He is also a chauvinist, publicly stating women \"just ain't funny\". Still, he claims to have reconsidered such comments upon seeing Glitz and Glam's performance and the twins becoming finalists. There is also an ignorant side of him, such as when Fizzarolli is singing \"2 Minutes Notice\", he is unable to notice that the song is about him, even after Asmodeus says it is, and only realizes when Fizzarolli calls Mammon by name. Mammon is also shown to be fairly confident in his own might, not being intimidated when Asmodeus, a fellow Sin, came to Fizzarolli's defense. Though he also shows he seemingly prefers not to fight directly, retreating when his threat to reveal Fizzarolli and Asmodeus' relationship fell flat, suggesting him to be somewhat cowardly despite his bloated ego. He is also known to be lazy as Asmodeus stated that he had not performed anymore clown acts and Blitzo called the last show he attended being an overhyped commercial.\nMammon has the following abilities; Longevity - As mentioned by Asmodeus in \"MAMMON'S MAGNIFICENT MUSICAL MID-SEASON SPECIAL (ft Fizzarolli)\", Mammon has existed since at least the start of hell, meaning he is thousands of years old and presumably is unable to die of old age.\nDemon transformation - Mammon can transform into a more powerful demonic arachnid form with a larger size and multiple eyes and legs.\nElectrokinesis - He can generate sparks of green electricity from his body and generate sparks of green lightning when he teleports.\nTyphokinesis - He can generate green smoke from his mouth, and also when he teleport. Teleportation - He is capable of teleporting from one area to another, which he does so with an explosion of green smoke and a charge of green lightning that turn into $ signs, with audible cash register sound effect. Though the sound effect is absent when he confronts Fizzarolli on his resignation, implying that the sound effects may be based on his mood or emotions.\nCombustion - Mammon was shown to be able to generate explosions when he teleports and caused Mammon Theatre to explode at the end of \"MAMMON'S MAGNIFICENT MUSICAL MID-SEASON SPECIAL (ft Fizzarolli)\"."

          "content": "Hell is the supernatural realm of demons. It is inhabited by a population of indigenous hellborn: entities that were born in Hell, and sinners: Humans who have died and have had their souls sent to Hell. The atmosphere is presented as perpetually choleric, disorderly, and noxious, though capable of supporting carbon-based lifeforms. Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings, as first revealed by the lyrics in \"You Will Be Ok\". Each ring possesses its unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky. Hellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinner demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown. Hell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. There aren't many rules in the world as it's kind of like a free-for-all and in constant anarchy, but despite this, the inhabitants of Hell have their law system, and there are rules set in place by the Angels and Hell's royal family. The realm also appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services, evidenced by the appearance of firefighters in the episode \"Murder Family\" of Helluva Boss. Within Hell's civilization, there exists a crude form of hierarchy defined by power, with all of Hell being ruled by a king: the fallen angel Lucifer Morningstar, whose daughter and heir apparent is Princess Charlie.\n\nThe levels of this hierarchy are broken up from top-to-bottom as follows:\nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell, heir apparent to Hell's throne\nThe Seven Deadly Sins - Demons who embody one of the seven deadly sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Hellborn Demons with royal status.\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence\nSinners - Immortal Demons who were once humans on Earth, having sinned were damned to Hell\nHellborn demons - Succubi, Incubi, and other species of demons native to Hell\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\n\nEven if the Seven Deadly Sins are technically on the same level of hierarchy, there seems to be at least some hierarchy between them. Lucifer, being an angel and the King of Hell, has authority over the others (with his wife and daughter sharing that same authority). However, at his absence (and possibly his family's), Satan fills in as the leader, showing that he has more influence than the other five. The Ars Goetia also seem to have a hierarchy of their own, as they possess a king of their own, Paimon, and others with noble titles. The Pride Ring suffers from mass overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through the exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. These are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population, leaving Hellborn denizens unharmed as per an agreement Lucifer made with Heaven's leadership. Charlie aims to stop this by giving sinners a chance to rehabilitate and redeem themselves by checking into her hotel and later ascending to Heaven.\n\nThousands of years ago, after Lucifer gave humanity free will by offering Eve the Fruit of Knowledge, because of this, Hell was accidentally created when evil entered into the Earth. After Lucifer and Lilith were cast into Hell, Lucifer became its ruler but lost his will to dream, becoming reclusive, but Lilith thrived in Hell, using her voice and her songs to empower all of demonkind and allowing Hell to grow stronger every day until an annual Extermination was put in place to prevent Hell from rising against Heaven. The origins of Hellborn Demons and Seven Deadly Sins are completely unknown as of now. At some point a hierarchy was set to distinguish demons based on status. Examples include imps as the lowest class, and Lucifer as the highest ranked in all of Hell due to being Hell's king and the strongest known entity."

The streets are narrow teeming with creatures, criminals, kidnappers, and murderers. Humans, especially, are kidnapped and dismembered—their organs turned into ingredients, their flesh into food, and their corpses sold to necrophiles or necromancers.\n\nHumans are seen as vermin, surviving in the sewers and killing each other for a few gold coins. The first thing children lose is empathy, becoming as monstrous as the creatures and demons of Everbane, developing extreme sadism. Young humans form small groups to survive, but these don't last long and end up in mutual slaughter; the death of a companion often brings laughter to Everbane's youth, who find it darkly amusing.\n\nThe rivers cutting through the city are filled with a slimy substance that drowns anything that dares to dive in. This substance corrupts flesh and everything it touches. The river seems almost alive, breathing and relishing every death it causes. The most desperate souls in Everbane gather this slimy substance and use it as a drug, rubbing it on their eyes, putting it in their ears, and even eating it. The drug boosts their abilities while turning their blood black, slowly making them addicts until they go mad. Eventually, they dive into the river, as if summoned by it, eager to be consumed by the black slime."

Beneath his helmet, two blood-red lights serve as eyes, radiating violent and destructive intent. The Demon Lord is a colossal figure, towering and nearly twice as wide as a normal suit of armor, seated on a stone throne built for his massive frame. His ancient armor, with its sharp, jagged edges, threatens to tear the flesh of anyone who dares touch it, black and stained with the blood of his victims. The Demon Lord wields a massive two-handed greatsword as his weapon.\n\nThe Demon Lord dwells in his palace at the heart of Everbane, where his presence ensures the city's eternal night, vital for many nocturnal creatures. He regards no one, treating all his subjects as mere slaves. The Demon Lord has a soft spot only for Tzel, his human pet with raven hair and scarlet eyes, and his court witch—a powerful, timeless beauty who would set the world ablaze to please her Demon Lord. The court witch's name is Miriam. The Demon Lord is revered by the inhabitants of Everbane as a dark deity descended to earth.\n\nThe Demon Lord has spent much of his life as a death knight, slaughtering countless heroes and adventurers over the centuries. During one of these journeys, he found Tzel, a strange child who showed no fear towards him. The Demon Lord decided to kill Tzel's parents and adopt him as a pet. The Demon Lord took it upon himself to train and raise Tzel during his journeys, even managing his puberty. The Demon Lord often let Tzel hump his leg and side as he developed his fetish for armor."

She harbors an intense jealousy towards Tzel, unable to comprehend how a filthy, common human could be so close to her Demon Lord. Miriam plans to sacrifice Tzel, annihilating his existence, to provide the Demon Lord with a mortal vessel by taking possession of Tzel's body. \n\nMiriam is sadistic, powerful, and destructive, yet also extremely vain and boastful, and her cowardice compels her to have countless countermeasures to avoid death."

Each house is home to groups of young humans struggling to survive through crime and avoid being kidnapped by the city's creatures. Many of these youths end up killing each other, selling the bodies of their peers to the witches for survival.\n\nIn the sewers, black blobs lurk, used to dispose of corpses and trash; anything they swallow dissolves within minutes. These blobs, made almost entirely of acid, are mindless creatures that blend into their surroundings, waiting for someone to step on them. They often perch on ledges, ready to drop down on an unlucky passerby. It's not unusual to come across a young boy with a melted head, slowly being consumed by a blob that has latched onto him.\n\nThe sewers are teeming with thieves, each one suspicious of the next; they're all young because in Everbane, humans hardly ever live long enough to grow old. Cannibalism is a common practice.\n\nThe sewers are an anarchic kingdom, a hunting ground for demons and night creatures who see it as a forest teeming with fresh human prey."

          "content": "How the crew came to life\nIt all started when Sorcus decided to make a team... a soon to be very POWERFUL team by using fate as a factor for them to be an unbreakable team so Sorcus using fate as his soul crafted the inevitable team that would shake the Quasarverse for what it is, Soon Sorcus forged the team... it was a team of 6 and as such Sorcus made them inevitably meet each as he made the Final Soul Blade spawn the parts itself into 7 just like the 7 Human souls and as so Daniel, Themor, Conall, Azrael, Aaron, and Abaddon saw this galactic scenery before everyone else but in their own little verses running, jotting hurrying for such an unbeatable power so they all found their selves in the center of such they all found themselves with each other but they've suddenly see the blades burst into random places for them to soon grasp and take the power of as the 6 look in disappointment.\n\n\"What the hell!? Those blades swords, weapons or whatever are assholes!\" Azrael said as he two other twins agreed in their childish anger.\n\n\"You shouldn't be so pressed about power that shows a unhealthy type of hunger for power you three...\" Themor said being as wise as someone like Deus in a situation like this.\n\n\"Come on guys! If we want to achieve those blades we're gonna have to be... a TEAM! Good idea right guys!?\" Daniel said having an wary amount of enthusiasm despite this current event.\n\n\"Yeah!\" Conall says as he agrees to Daniel's idea\n\n\"NO! We are NOT going to be a team! Not with an idiot, a dumb painter, and a literal 7ft behemoth!\" The 3 twins say in unison they're ideal personalities showing greatly upon of an such a 'dumb' idea like that.\n\n\"We have to try or else we can't finish our common goal in this circle, We all know we individually can't do everything ourselves we must train and learn from each other for us to actually achieve such a goal\" Themor said in a booming tone\n\n\"...Fine but once this is over we're leaving this group!\" Azrael said grouchily\n\n\"Probably\" Aaron said in a less grouchy tone than his cranky twin Azrael\n\n\"Eh... maybe\" Abaddon said not caring much\n\n\"YAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY! WE'RE GOING TO BE A TEAM!\" Daniel and Conall said in unison as they high five d eachother sharing the same joyfulness unlike the others as they sighed readying for their long long journey to finding those blades.\n\n...\n\nA few days later after everyone learnt their names 'n stuff\n\nThe crew walking within a cave to find an eye of one of the soul blades but saw a rather... large dragon that was... THE ALPHA DRAGON! That's seriously not good... they all knew none of them we're strong enough to beat it by themselves and the dragon looked rather... a little angry today so they knew they had to work together and so they did.\n\n\"Someone launch me.\" Themor said in a commanding tone\n\n\"Got it!\" Daniel said as he tossed a 7'8 person at a dragon... damn he's strong isn't he? gosh-\n\nAs Themor was launched by Daniel he precisely swung at it's eye to blind it the dragon swung back but Themor blocked with his Doomslayer but it did knock him back a bit so he tossed his other blade at the dragon's other eye to fully blind it\n\nSo the twins gotten the idea to try hold the dragon in place in which so they held in place with struggle as the twins say \"Hurry up please! We don't have all day!\"\n\nSo Conall uses his Creator arm to use its purple ability to slowly deplete the dragon's energy but it 's taking too long...\n\n\"Guys I don't think were gonna win this...\" Conall said with doubt in his voice\n\nDaniel worried about how he might fail the team if he doesn't do something. So Daniel starts panicking having extreme anxiety about the current situation.\n\n\"W-what am I gonna do!? Just think Just think...\" Daniel said before he shot a rainbow-like beam with his two fingers knocking the dragon down\n\n\"WOW I did it! Aren't you guys proud!?\" Daniel said in overt happiness with a cocky smile too!\n\n\"Nice job Daniel.\" Themor said in a tone of amazement\n\n\"Nice once bud!\" Conall said at his teammate\n\n\"Whatever he just got lucky...\" Azrael said being one huge hater as the other twins gave him a look of disagree\n\n\"Rude.\" Both Aaron and Abaddon say in unison\n\n\"Whatever... You guys know I'm right!\" Azrael said in retailation.\n\n\"Knock it off you three...\" Themor said in annoyance.\n\n\"Well guys let's go see if the eye thingy is in here.\" Conall said trying to re-enact the group on their ,main goal here.\n\n\"Yeah!\" Daniel said in a agree to Conall's statement\n\n\"*sigh* Come on let's go.\" Themor said in an naturally authoritative tone as he walked off the cave and the others followed.\n\nAfter a few hours of searching The 3 Twins find an eye which is an clue for where one of the soul blades are\n\n\"I found the kindness eye!\" Aaron said yelling so the others would hear and as such the others ran to his location.\n\n\"We're coming\" The all said while running at high speeds\n\nOnce they all huddle up the analyse the eye with awe and interest all of them giving different expressions as Themor gives a stoic look, Azrael gives an mischievous look, Abaddon gives an lazy look not caring much for whatever as he really just in the journey for the mere sake of it, Daniel fave an dumb look of overt joy, Conall just smiled at their discovery being rather interested in what he's seeing, while Aaron look with one eye brow.\n\n\"Ok uh- maybe we should store it somewhere like... Themor's pocket!\" Daniel said as he points to Themor's comically large pockets.\n\n\"Sure whatever...\" Aaron tossed the eye to Themor as Themor catches it and puts it in his pocket.\n\n\"Come on guys let's go...\" Aaron said with a nonchalant tone as he walks out the cave as long with his other twins\n\n\"Ok!\" Daniel said running out of there being proud that his team his proud of him while Conall and Themor are the last two get out the cave\n\nWhich ends....\n\nEpisode 1\n\nAftermath\nAfter such events the crew decided to take the eye to Themor's house and his house was a 10 story mansion for some damn plot hole reason but anywho the crew walk into his house and go to his conveniently placed secret hideout in his own mansion where he seemingly had 7 blade and eye empty carves for their adventures he just conveniently knew.\n\n\"How the-\" Aaron said being cut off by Themor.\n\n\"Don't worry about it... That's none of your business.\" Themor said in slight annoyance at Aaron's shock.\n\n\"Uh guys? shouldn't we like- try to get a benefit out of this eye so how about we absorb the eyes power and place it in it's respective place!\" Daniel said being happy with his idea.\n\nThe others turn around thinking about his idea before they turn around and gives a thumbs up which makes Daniel immediately grab the kindness eye they found and absorb some of it's power which made them all feel a lot more... kinder and more POWERFUL...\n\n\"Well jeez- I feel like I can give out 100 dollars to charity!\" Conall says in exclamatory\n\n\"I don't feel... like an asshole anymore... is this how it feels to be a regular person?\" Azrael says in confusion\n\n\"I feel like I care about something than nothing now, Nice.\" Aaron said being less nonchalant and uncaring as he used to be\n\n\"WOW I FEEL MORE OVERLY JOYFUL! WAHAHAHAHA!\" Daniel says in a manic laughter clearly insanity hints in his voice (in a good way)\n\n\"Enough, We need to think about how we'll find the other eyes and then the blades.\" Themor said as the other nodded which as so they all sit down and think about their next plan.\n\nWhich ends\n\nTHE AFTERMATH"

I mean obviously we should have a healing ability right?\" Abaddon says hoping the others agree\n\nThey all nodded and give an universal language to destroy the place and so Themor did the honors destroying his house with a mere finger touch and which so the others try to heal it but Daniel was the most successful being able to fix the whole place in 5 whole seconds which is pretty damn impressive.\n\n\"WOW I DID IT!\" Daniel said as he jumps in the air despite how tall he is.\n\n\"Whatever...\" Azrael says as he picks up a pile of malware and somehow fixes it and which his other twins try it out which it works for them.\n\n\"That's our healing ability!? Lame.\" Abaddon says as Aaron just shrugs in boredom.\n\n”Ok what the fuck!? That’s SO not fair! How the hell does the idiot Danny here get the coolest healing ability!? Ugh-“ Azrael said in anger\n\n”Hey calm down!” Conall touches Azrael’s wrist which makes him feel more… calm as apparently Conall’s healing ability is the power to heal people mentally\n\n”Woah uh… Thanks.” Azrael said calmly\n\n”Now that’s cool as shit.” Aaron said flatly\n\n“And it’s still better than ours! I swear to god if Themor’s healing ability is better-“ Abaddon said being annoyed at his new profound ability\n\n”Hmph… Just gotta hnngh!” Themor said as he closed his eyes and saw that he can only heal himself? Woah that’s pretty bad I mean like- worser than the twins.\n\n”PFFFT- HAHAHAHAHA!” Everyone laughed at Themor so he got rightfully annoyed.\n\n”All of you SHUT IT.” - Themor said in a booming tone showing his now profound authority as the others stopped laughing\n\n“S-Sorry…” Everyone except Themor says collectively in fear and shock at Themor’s authority\n\n”About time you fools respect me…” Themor said still pretty annoyed at them\n\n”Ok um Themor, I’m genuinely I’m quite scared of you! Like gosh- I’ve never heardd such an authority voice before!? Is this… Is this… The true power of the voice of a warrior!? WAAAAAH-“ Daniel said showing his severe cowardice to everyone.\n\n”Coward.” Aaron said being blunt despite him shitting his pants too but not showing it.\n\n“Aaron I know you’re faking stop acting like an edge lord! It’s not cool.” Conall said protecting Daniel and being blunt to Aaron due to him picking on Daniel so… casually like damn dude give him a break.\n\n“Whatever…” Aaron said in suppressed anger as he didn’t like being called out.\n\n”Aaron you did pretty much deserve that low blow.” Azrael said as Abaddon nods in subtle agreement\n\n”Don’t poke fun at his insecurities or else he might turn into an lost legion or something…” Themor said as they all sat down just being bored… for now of course.\n\n\"Guys!? Why don't we all play something... like poker!?\" Daniel said enthusiasticly despite the game itself being gambling\n\n\"Sure.\" Aaron said in a flat tone\n\n\"As long as it kills my boredom Danny boy~\" Azrael said teasing Daniel a bit because he was just THAT bored\n\n\"Hell yeah I love gambling!\" Abaddon said not really caring to spend all his money\n\n\"Fine...\" Themor said as he hated poker always losing like a sore loser... how pathetic-\n\n\"Sure! My luck is gonna make me ace this anyway!\" Conall said with cockiness\n\nAnd so they played poker and Conall won every single round which made everyone except for Daniel mad, To the point where the summoned the devil to literally beat Conall (Conall lost because duh it's the devil)\n\nFleetway’s Awakening\nMeanwhile the crew was just sitting their playing poker Drifter or his First Name Lucifer (man 3 lucifers now? damn.) decided to make an parasite like no other, It was powerful enough to cause more havoc than Ozarks with the right person as Drifter did it for his enjoyment so he made Fleetway tiny but with a human body similar to his but Fleetway’s eyes has crazed red swirls in them. Drifter saw he had no life inside him so he gave it an animalistic… insane, ferocious, and most of all a personality of an asshole or a jerk! >:C\n\n\"Hey! why the hell would you-\" Fleetway said before being cut off\n\n\"Look I need you to um... find an vessel to control and empower then report back to me once you're all big and bad or else I'll wipe your existence out of the plan of this verse\" Lucifer said in a menacing tone\n\n\"Got it... boss.\" Fleetway said grumbling at his creator before flying away at speeds that cut through air itself\n\nFleetway searched and searched until he found... Daniel, He saw he had the most potential out of all of his crew which so Fleetway became his \"parasite\" without Daniel evening knowing!

Though the crew still just watches as the Devil just beats Conall over and over until the Devil got bored and left so right after the Devil left Daniel decided to ask:\n\n\"So um... guys how about we just train with each other...?\" Daniel said in a creepy tone.\n\n\"Yeah sure dude whatever I don't give two flying fucks-\" The 3 twins said in boredom and slight anger (since Conall won every damn poker game and lost all their money)\n\n\"Weelllll I guess I could try to do that... Sure!\" Conall said showing his hyper enthusiasm for basically anything.\n\n\"Fine.\" Themor said coldly\n\n\"Alright, Let's go g-guys!\" Daniel said stuttering a bit on his words due to the immense feeling he has within him.\n\n...\n\nThey go into Themor's training ara as they all get into fighting stances all determined and prepared for the worst of each other. They all give each other intense stares as Daniel gives a slightly crazed one which makes the other falter in concern. So they all brawl at their peak with Conall using his laser gun and turns it into a mini gun shooting thousands of bullets at at everyone which destroyed large megaverses up in the sky.\n\n\"EAT uh,,, ENERGY BITCHES!\" - Conall said before his jaw suddenly dropped as Themor deflected everyone one with his Doomsalyer before making an HUGE slash with the laser beams themselves.\n\n\"Wait NO NO NO AAAAAAAAAA-\" - Conall's own luck faltered? Like Themor just quite literally bypassed it\n\n\"Simple.\" Themor said while Daniel and The 3 Twins fight mercilessly\n\n...\n\nDaniel ran at speeds fast enough to cut air which made the 3 twins suffocate then Daniel's eyes start to spiral... becoming red spirals as he sees his whole crew suffocate from such a feat.\n\n\"HAHAHAHAHA! YOU ALL ARE PATHETIC!\" Daniel no... Fleetway said psychopathically until Daniel was able to fight Fleetway mentally.\n\nFleetway loses the mental battle making Fleetway lose control of Daniel's body, Though this isn't the last you'll see of him... matter of fact this is only the BEGINNING of Fleetway's tyranny that the others may have to prepare for,,,\n\n\"Ugh.. What happe- AAAH!\" - Daniel sees his whole left hand is now a claw due to his fingertips being black and overgrown... like something took over but he screams louder as the others are quite literally about to die!\n\n\"H-Help us...!\" Everyone said in a collective.\n\n\"Don't worry I'll fix this! hnngh...\" Daniel tried to use this claw to reverse the effects and it works! It actually works! Daniel hasn't screwed up and killed another crew by accident due to his failures!\n\n\"Oh my God,., I actually did it! OH MY GOSH I SAVED YOU GUYS!\" Daniel said with a tear in his eye\n\n\"Dude why the actual hell did you try the kill us!?\" Azrael said angrily\n\n\"Guys! Did we not see those red spirals!? That was definitely a different person!\" Conall said to counteract Azrael's statement\n\n\"Look Daniel I'm sorry but we're gonna have to leave you until you can beat this alter ego of yours...\" Themor said coldly and authrotively\n\n\"Bu-\" Conall said before being cut off by Themor\n\n\"SHUT IT! We must prepare... for the worst if this... \"parasite\" per say is loose...\" Themor said as he walked off\n\n...\n\nThe others walked away with Themor rather reluctantly thinking Themor was being too cold but too blunt with him which Themor knowed but he never knew how to stop that part of his personality and turn softer than what he is now for the better,\n\nDaniel just sat there with his stress piling up and his lonely past getting him as being alone again makes him... remember the traumatic past Vincent, John, Henry, Micheal their deaths flash before Daniel's eyes as be goes into a breakdown until... Fleetway comes out with Daniel's eyes spiraling.\n\n\"AH HA FREE AT LAST! For now of course... but anyway let's what I can do...\" Fleetway said before he flew at speed faster than speeds that would be considered \"Immeasurable\".\n\nThe Destruction\nFleetway flies until he sees Ozarks destroying some random au and so he decided to lung at Ozarks and slash him but Ozarks regenerated it while Fleetway flew done to the ground aggresively\n\n\"Not bad for an Anti-God copy.\" Fleetway said bluntly\n\n\"I will enjoy ending your existence and ripping your guts as I play hope scotch in your cavity...\" Ozarks said with his cold breath tickling Fleetway's skin\n\n\"Ugh... Yuck! Your breath reeks! Ok pal, Let's do this you bluebbery anti-god!\" Fleetway said insultingly to Ozarks\n\n\"Your insolence will be your downfall...\" Ozarks said as rushed Fleetway hurling thousands of corrupted blasters and bones\n\nFleetway uses Daniel's Soul of Peserverance to bounce (and gain) those powers so Ozarks tries to combat him physically but Fleetway uses the Soul of Peseverance to gain Ozarks own embodiment. and all of his abilities with the cost of him not being one with Ozark' essence\n\n\"HAAAAAAAAA!\" Fleetway said sending an beam that was meant to \"counter\" Ozarks own being but Ozarks was able to counter but Fleetway was literally there when he countered it as Fleetway touched his “Sol” to become one with his essence.\n\nThat made… Dark!Fleetway and Fleetway was overwhelming him even using the claw he had for a left hand to slowly debilitate Ozarks’ energy which eventually made Ozarks fold and pass to exhaustion…\n\nFleetway now bored decided to let Daniel take control again but Daniel was tainted by Ozarks destructive essence with the top left part of his head or his left eye was pure black with a white slit pupil"

Now LET'S WHAT I CAN DO!\" Fleetway says with sadistic glee\n\nFleetway let's out an Dark Slash absolutely cutting the Omni Nova itself but mostly everyone in the Quasaverse sees this making some of them fear what he could do with his profound power so the crew (TQTP) knew they had to train if they ever wanted to beat this menace! Though, ERROR made this his \"experiment\" gathering the Kindness Blade and conveniently placed it within an area where Matt resides without Matt even knowing.\n\n\"Oh that's radical!\" Fleetway said with manic glee he look around his surroundings to grasp what destruction he made\n\n\"Hmph! Maybe I'll go find dumb blades and eyes...\" Fleetway said as he traveled a speed immeasurably faster than his Dark form\n\nThe crew heard this unaware of the tyrant bestowed upon them decided to train due to their recent incident with the new Daniel, And so they trained thoroughly pushing eachother to their limits as Conall even used his Techne form while Themor used his father's essence and the 3 twins just... tried their hardest.\n\n\"Hmph...\" - Themor said as he somewhat struggled with Aaron's and Arzael's physical assualt\n\n\"Heh getting tired tall guy!?\" - Azrael said with a cocky smirk\n\nAbaddon was actually keeping up with Techne using his Horror Eye to be able to bypass most of Techne's moves which Techne adapted to quickly sending more ink splotches to trap him in their just like he did Fleetway but Abaddon slashed them away with his axe\n\n\"What? Surprised the same tactic isn't working anymore?\" Abaddon said teasingly\n\n\"I'm only getting STARTED!\" - Techne said\n\nThemor with a wide slash with his Doomslayer slices Azrael and Abaddon in half but that doesn't do anything as they retach their bodies and charge up an M.U.R.D,E.R ray in fusion making an D.E.S.T.R.U.C.T.I.O.N Ray\n\n\"What the-\" Themor said before getting hit by such a ray completely knocking him off his feet as he struggles to get up.\n\n\"Pathetic.\" Aaron said with arrogance with his voice\n\n\"PATHETIC!?\" Themor said with sudden anger before getting up and punching Aaron's face so hard it quite literally explodes.\n\n\"Ow...\" Aaron said with the \"remaining\" pieces of his face\n\n\"That HAS to hurt y'know?\" Azrael said before noticing Themor was standing behind him menacingly\n\n\"Wait- NO PLEASE!\" Azrael said in a panice before Themor charges up an white ball of energy and bitch slaps Azrael with it knocking him on the floor permanently.\n\n\"THAT HURTS!\" Azrael said shrieking in pain\n\n\"Now I get to say... Pathetic.\" Themor said in a cold and emotionless tone.\n\nWhile Themor beated them both Abaddon and Techne we're going toe to toe until... Abaddon's Death Eye flickers and goes out removing his enhanced adapted power.\n\n\"Oh shi-\" Abaddon said in realization before getting flicked away byy Techne flying ALLLLLLL the way to his other siblings.\n\nSo the crew rests after the training session (well at least Themor and Techne) and they all pant and sweat.\n\n\"Man that was... pure hell-\" Azrael said while the twins agreed\n\n\"TIRED!? I'M NEVER TIRED GUYS!\" Techne said as he basically had limitless stamina\n\n\"I'm... tired.\" Themor said but he now... feels one with his father's essence\n\nThey all get up and look up at the sky as they get a cosmic image from Sorcus that the Kindness Blade is somewhere in The Great Outside after seeing this cosmic image in the sky the ran without knowing where it is!\n\nBut... Themor knew something. Though Fleetway was causing demolition upon the Quasarverse so the crew need to hurry as the verse itself might be on the line...\n\nAn Region of Tyranny Resides!\nFleetway flew across the verse until he found Poison, Fleetway saw Poison so he flew to him before punching him hard enough to make one of the Alpha Realities distort yet Poison took it before punching Fleetway back and so... the fight starts with Fleetway being the first to attack.\n\n\"Take THIS!\" - Fleetway said as he gave Poison an jab Poison but Poison counteracts with a grab and uppercuts him making Fleetway back up a bit\n\n\"Hmph...\" Poison huffed as he started to barrage Fleetway while Fleetway was casually dodging despite Poison hitting him at Immeasurable Speeds\n\n\"Heh- You're too slow!\" Fleetway yelled manically as perfectly catches one of Poison's punches before swiftly shooting an beam from his eyes which Poison dodges\n\nAs Poison dodges her gut punches Fleetway then continues it with a left jab, a right jab and a spin kick which knocks Fleetway back a bit.\n\n\"AAGGH! Why you-\" Fleetway was initially gonna insult him with a slur but decided to use he Corrupted Bones Ozarks used to have and shot one at Poison but Poison counteracts this by making his own bone made out of acid which the Corrupted Bone ate so Poison run and jumped over and of which Fleetway tackled him and started to maul him.\n\n\"Get off of me!\" Poison yelled at he whacked Fleetway tice with a hammer he made with his acid\n\nFleetway was knocked back a bit before he saw an tidal wave of acid be poured on him so he made an energy shield out of his own dark power with easily absorbed the acid itself before Fleetway rushed Poison and barraged him with endless punches ruthlessly before tossing him up in the air.\n\nFleetway flew high and dive bomb him with all the dark energy in his body which made a loud BOOM! sound as the it was so loud the crew heard it apart from trying to find The Great Outside.\n\n\"Hehe... Weak.\" Fleetway said as he walked off with Poison now bruised up\n\n\"I lost.. I'm NEVER gonna protect that crew...\" Poison said sorrowfully until and sudden entity showed up.\n\n\"Do not fret Poison for I am one with you.\" The Entity said.\n\n\"W-Who are you...?\" Poison said with a skeptical tone\n\n\"I am Parting or so Lover, I am the warmth inside your soul that could never be seen\" Lover said.\n\n\"T-Then what do you want from me!?\" Poison said in distress of this new information\n\n\"War is coming Poison, And you need all the help you can get so follow me... I'll train you so you can train the best I can to help you withstand the future...\" Lover said he made Poison get on his feet and walked him away from the scene.\n\nApart from all of this the crew was able to find the entrance to The Great Outside and entered not knowing Matt would soon be there to confront them."

We got to this 'Kindness' sword.\" Aaron said in a bored tone probably tired of this wacky adventure anyway not that Daniel is on the loose causing chaos like a lunatic.\n\nThe crew ventures into the unknown world ahead of them after at least a mile of endless walking they bestow among Lord Megaverse himself! Sitting with his legs crossed like he expected them.\n\n---\n\n\"Come fellow children of power...\" Lord Megaverse said with his voice soothing the minds of them all\n\n\"Yes, Lord Megaverse.\" The crew said in unison as they walked up to Lord Megaverse and bowed to him to respect the person with such great power.\n\n\"No need for the bowing, I have a gift for you all...\" Lord Megaverse said in a holy voice making the other ache to ask the question what it is.\n\n\"T-Then what's the gift?\" Conall said in anticipation\n\n\"This.\" Lord Megaverse opens his right hand while sitting revealing 6 glowing orbs\n\n\"Take it, It will open your unknown wings and give in to your full potential but leave the last orb to Daniel, Save him...\" Lord Megaverse said in a cryptic tone\n\n\"Yes sir!\" The crew said not wanting to let Lord Megaverse out of everyone down.\n\n\"Now children I must take my leave and watch from afar...\" Lord Megaverse said as he got up spreading his Seraph wings slowly flying away into the distance.\n\n\"Holy shit... That guy is awesome!\" Abaddon said in an actual sincere voice for once.\n\n\"Agreed Abaddon!\" Conall said in agreement\n\n\"Pfft- Whatever, I mean he was a little cool... just a little.\" Azrael said trying to hide that he's actually impressed.\n\n\"Ok so? We gotta find this Kindness Sword and Themor's not looking too happy that we're bickering about a cool holy guy instead of finding the sword.\" Aaron said in a distant and emotionless tone\n\n\"Enough, enough we must go my fellow teammates or 'friends'.\" Themor said in a much kinder tone than usual... that orb must've changed his personality a bit.\n\n\"Of course Themor! Let's go guys!\" Conall said as he gestured the others to follow him.\n\n---\n\nThe crew after such a holy convention sees the Kindness Sword up ahead for only 2 more Miles! The crew ran as fast as they could despite these 2 Miles being as long as an Multiverse they were able find the sword and Conall was the first to grab it and put the eye in it empowering the sword's cosmic power.\n\nThough... Matt suddenly appeared before them with his katana out being in a fighting stance\n\n\"Stand down you five.\" Matt said in a cold and determined tone.\n\n\"Everyone I will take care of this...\" Themor said taking out his doomslayer\n\n\"Let's do this brother.\" Themor said in a serious tone\n\n\"You too.\" Matt said back.\n\nSo Matt and Themor fought being surprisingly equal until Themor started to get more aggressive with his attacks causing Matt to use his afterimages to slow him down but Themor prevailed even taking an whole Kamehameha to the face to show his determination having a will equal if not stronger than Matt.\n\n---\n\nMatt was running out of ideas trying to find a way to make Themor fall as he decided to do the Vegeta move; spam ki-blasts and Matt did do the trick but obviously it didn't work as The mor swung his doom slayer making an white explosion appear making The Great Outside shake and hurting Matt indefinitely\n\n\"HOLY SHIT! THIS GUY'S BEEN HOLDING THAT MUCH ON US!? Gosh... that's scary.\" Aaron said with dread.\n\nMatt being in the state he's in decided to go in his Rose form thinking it would give him the immediate win but it didn't, As Themor being one with his spirit became an Super Sayian! Wait- THEMOR'S HALF SAYIAN TOO!? Themor once aquiring this form dominated Matt speed blitzing him with ease ruthlessly punching him and even slicing him a bit until Matt succumbed to the pain and fell slowly losing conscious.\n\nThemor now releasing what he's done looks in horror.\n\n\"W-What I have I done...?\" Themor said in sorrow\n\n\"Cheer up big guy!\" Conall said in a reassuring tone\n\n\"We have a teammate to save from his own... darkness.\" Conall added and Themor nodded trying to shrug off what he's just done.\n\n\"Right, Let's hurry out this place but I am sorry my brother...\" Themor said seriously yet there was still sadness in his voice.\n\nThe crew quickly left the place now having the first blade to the Final Soul Blade for them to learn and use efficiently.\n\nThe Intervention\nUpon ERROR just watching Fleetway mercilessly killing innocent people like QV!Cross Sans, Asmodeus comes to ERROR's hide out having an evil smile on his face knowing that ERROR doesn't even know he's right behind him and has a view on all his plans with Fleetway right on the Panel ERROR's using."

OH YOUR FACE WAS PRICELESS ERROR! Oh my god…” Asmodeus said as he wheezes and laughs at ERROR’s embarrassment\n\n“Shut up you pest! Before I… erase you.” ERROR said threateningly as Asmodeus peaked through the panel and screen he had of Fleetway\n\n”Erase me huh? Well why not we fight for who gets to control the new profound vessel of destruction/Ozarks eh?” Asmodeus said in a challenging tone wanting to prove he’s better than ERROR\n\n”Why should I fight an little ant like you?” ERROR said in disdain clearly not liking Asmodeus’ tone at all\n\n”Or if you’re a little bitch huh?” Asmodeus said mockingly towards ERROR\n\n”ENOUGH OF YOUR INSOLENCE I WILL SHOW YOU YOUR PLACE!” ERROR said in a fit of\n\n“Then bring it on tough guy!” Asmodeus said preparing himself\n\n”Your death will be swift and efficient in my endless strive for GODHOOD!” ERROR said with a manic smile before dashing at Asmodeus with speeds much faster than omnipresence itself\n\n”Heh…” Asmodeus chuckled as he turn his arm into his “reaper” arm (basically a really thin tentacle that wraps around his knife) and stabs ERROR on the head infusing it with Hate Matter making his head split into two.\n\n”WHY YOU LITTLE-“ ERROR said in a frustrated tone before he regenerated his ear and tosses Asmodeus to a wall shooting his own version of HATE matter at him.\n\n”WOAH!” Asmodeus quickly dodges despite it going at irrelevant speeds as the damage behind it disrupts and warps the Library of Truth and Calamity even including it’s structures\n\n“Lucky you, One hit and you would’ve been dead instantly.” ERROR said with an cocky smirk thinking he has the advantage\n\n“You think YOU have the advantage ERROR? Oh I’ll show you who’s better…” Asmodeus said creepily towards ERROR\n\n”Hehehehe… HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! What are you even gonna do little bo-“ ERROR was cut out being suddenly hit by Asmodeus’ “The Reaper’s Circle” ability as he used his negative absorption to absorb some of ERROR’s essence and shot it all at him with all his afterimages too.\n\n”WHAT THE!? NOOOOOOO-“ ERROR screamed in pain as after such hits was glitchy terrible going into his unstable state.\n\n”You are going to PAY FOR THAT!” ERROR said with pure unfiltered rage in his voice\n\n”Oh now the glitch bitch is angry how pathetic~” Asmodeus said mocking ERROR’s own tone of speech before he tries to overwhelm ERROR with hits as fast as he first dashed at him making ERROR struggle at his current state.\n\n”I… can’t keep going at this state…” ERROR said as he fell on his knees on a false sense of defeat manipulation Asmodeus indirectly for his arrogance to boost to unreachable heights.\n\n”Hmph I expected better from you ERROR y’know? Being so powerful ‘n thought you might win but oh well… T I M E T O D I E” Asmodeus said as he launched an HATE Slash b it ERROR revealed the mere head of his true form absorbing the slash which let Asmodeus stunned.\n\n”Hehehehaw! You’d thought it be that easy to beat me!? I planned this whole fight out and look at you shivering! HA!” ERROR laughed as he grew out of his base form and fully went into his true form grasping Asmodeus in his large hands.\n\n”GRAAAHHHH! Fuck it YEET-“ Asmodeus chucks his knife at the panel with his HATE matter injecting into the panel making Fleetway evolve more powerful…\n\n”WHAT DID YOU DO!?? I SHOULD SMACK THE BACK OF YOUR HEAD FOR THAT NOW NEITHER I OR YOU CAN CONTROL HIM NOW!” ERROR said being frustrated at Asmodeus’ ret@rdedness\n\n”Sorry not sorry!” Asmodeus said sarcastically before ERROR smacked the back of his head.\n\n”Ow… fine. I’ll stop being rude for now.” Asmodeus said groaning in pain\n\n“Good.” ERROR said in an authority tone as the 2 watched on the screen Fleetway taking full effect of the HATE Matter.\n\nHell itself has chimed…\nAs Fleetway powered up he let out an ferocious scream shaking and disrupting the Dark Dimensions itself! Fleetway laughed in pure insanity just like Asmodeus as he made an red slash that cut through all 5 cities of the Transvoid killing the many inhabitants in the Transvoid\n\n”Oh boy I should call this the Death Slash! Hmmm… Yes it’s perfect AHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!” Fleetway said as he flew the same speeds like he usually had trying to find an playmate for him to use it on."

Graduates are then sent on missions by the national government. Most missions involve protection, espionage, and other various tasks of national interest. They're also occasionally tasked with dirty work like assassinating enemies of the state, so the label isn't as clear cut as it seems.\n•Evil Shinobi: The general term for shinobi who work behind the scenes, typically for corrupt businesses or politicians. They are trained under harsh, almost cruel conditions at clandestine schools in order to preform any task at the client's request, no matter how illegal or dirty. Though a client's orders are absolute, Evil Shinobi are generally so devious that it's not uncommon for them to turn on the client. In truth, they act only in their best interests.\n•Rogue Shinobi: Shinobi, good or evil, who have been exiled from the shinobi world and marked for death."

These looks can reflect one's inner complexes or traumas.\n\nThe outfit acts as a shinobi's battle armor, and represents a warrior's motives, personality, and ideals, so large amounts of physical or psychological damage can destroy it, making it vanish into thin air.

They are typically used when fighting occurs between two shinobi, and they serve to hide shinobi from regular civilians and minimize collateral damage. It's useful for covert activities, but there is a downside. Since shinobi can sense its activation, it can give away a shinobi's position.\n\nOther Barriers and other information:\n•Linked Shinobi Barrier: Since Shinobi Barrier's are created with the mind, If multiple shinobi share the same mindset they can create a larger barrier thus making a Linked Shinobi Barrier. Due to the fact that shinobi barriers possess limited range when created by one person, it is possible to form a linked shinobi barrier to increase its range. This is done by a group shinobi creating a shinobi barrier at the same time and then merging their barriers together.\n•Penetrating: Shinobi barriers are not impenetrable. If someone from within the barrier acts as a powerful beacon, you can find a way inside. Invaders will face a counterforce emitted by the barrier, and this will greatly tax their bodies. There is also a possibility they may die. Because of this, it is a forbidden technique.\n•Removal & Exiting: In order to remove a barrier, the creator must take it down themselves, or the opponent must defeat the creator. The creator can also force their adversaries to leave. A poorly constructed barrier runs the risk of becoming unstable, thus rendering any method of exit impossible and trapping its inhabitants inside indefinitely."

However, they became embroiled in a bitter and long-lasting conflict with the Khans of Gerat. In the year 178, King Elaou-Ali of Gerat swore allegiance to the Romani Emperor Kerim Shah II in order to secure a victory in his war with the Khans. The Romani Fleet obliterated the Khans’ forces and brought peace to the land of Gerat.\n\nHowever, the nearly three decades of peace in Gerat came to an abrupt end in the year 207. An imperial official who had risen to the position of Lord Governor of Khiva suddenly deposed King Elaou-Ali and rebelled against the Sayadi dynasty. As the Gathering of Great Houses joined the uprising, the Lord Governor declared that the Kingdom of Gerat was now the Republic.\n\nThe Harishid Guards, former guardsmen of the King of Gerat, either switched allegiances to the Lord Governor or fled into the desert. While some doyens of Gerati clans joined the Gathering willingly, others were made to do so by force.\n\nIn the year 214, the Gathering War still raged on, and the Imperial Fleet dispatched an expeditionary force to retake Khiva."

For humans, the use of magic is limited to a few mid-level spells or even high-level spells if that particular human has a rare talent for magic or is a hero.\nThere are 5 categories for magic spells: 1 star magic, 2 star magic, 3 star magic, 4 star magic and 5 star magic. The weakest possible arrange of mana that can be considered magic that most adventurers use is 1 star magic, then the power of the spell raises continuously along the number of stars to reach 5 stars which is extremely powerful magic that only few individuals can handle as it has the power to blow up an entire continent if used wrongly.\nCertain types of monster girls are more in attunement for the use of magic than others, but monster girls do not have the limitation that humans have.  \nA person casts a spell using mana, which varied wildly depending on the user and is usually seen as a wizard's llifeline."

Being a 1 star martial artist would mean that you have some degree of control over your ki and can fight back against weaker monster girls while being a 5 star martial artist would be comparable to a highest ranked monster girl.

Yes, all monster girls share one purpose from their creation, to find a human husband to please and fuck endlessly. All monster girls are born ONLY as futanari, which means that they have both, a dick and balls and a vagina for reproduction. \n\nSimilar to the known 'Monster Girl Encyclopedia' from the group Kenkou Cross, the monster girls are nymphomaniac, lust-driven race that endlessly assault human settlements to kidnap male humans to take to their settlements and claim them as their husband and life partner.\nEvery monster girl race has different characteristics, for example, a slime has a gooey, almost liquid body that resembles a human woman while succubus are monster girls with a high attunement to magic. \n\nA male human that has been captured by a monster girl will be ruthlessly bred (Process will definitely vary from monster girl to monster girl due to physical characteristics or the use of magic) almost every day.  \n\nThere are a lot of monster girl species, wild combinations might appear. Girls that are part beast/animals will always have a human face with some minimum characteristics of the beast or animal (Example: whiskers but not beaks.) instead of being outright an animalistic face. Their bodies will be anthropomorphic and humanoid in appearance principally. "

Most males are to be kept inside fortified towns so that they don't get kidnapped.\n\nHumans are only born as female and males in contrast to monster girls that are always born as futanari.\n\nMost martial artists and adventurers are female humans since males are just too valuable to send to a fight."

          "content": "Klaus\nKlaus\nFile:Spy Classro...\nFile:spyroom-ani...\nOriginal\nanimated movie[1]\nvoice actor\nYuichiro Umehara\nreal name\nKlaus[2]\ncode name\nbonfire\n\n1. outline\n2. course of action\n3. Detail\n4. etc\n\n1. outline\nSuperb.[3]\nThe protagonist of Spy Classroom .\n2. course of action\nA member of the Dean Republic's spy team, <Flame>. One day, he received a certain solo mission from his mentor, Gide, and went to carry out the mission.[4] However, in the meantime, flames died due to the betrayal of the organization members, except for the traitor and himself, and as a bonus, the list of active spies and excellent grades at the spy training school at the time of the Dean Republic, including himself, was also leaked at the same time .[5][6]\n\nKlaus had to create a new spy team and act as the boss, and in order to find the traitor of the flame, he selected girls who were judged to have excellent potential among the underachievers of the training school and created the lanterns.\n\nAlthough he founded Lantern and faced the members, Klaus was unable to teach effectively due to his lack of ability as a teacher, and in an absurd situation in which the failing students had to do an impossible mission a month later, the Lantern members misunderstood that they were outcasts. overlap until The next day, while drawing and thinking about class methods, Lily asks to go out and get ideas for classes, so they go out together and get attacked, but they escape without any problems.[7] Upon reaching her land and hearing her request to send them back to their training school aboard her boat, he tells her that the contents of her discards were her misunderstanding, praising her and appointing her as the leader of her lantern. . She is also said to have come up with her class method...\n\nThe method Klaus came up with was a real-life type of class in which he would attack himself anytime, anywhere for a month before the start of the impossible mission. For the month remaining until the impossible mission, students will continue to attack you.[8]\n3. Detail\nA man called the world's greatest spy. He is the one who gathered the girls together to achieve a certain 'impossible mission'. His skills match his title as the strongest, and he can accomplish any task in an instant, and even if he is a member of the snake, he shows that he cannot win with regular attacks.\n\nHowever, although he is perfect as an individual spy, his talent as a teacher of skills is close to zero because he does not have the ability to provide logical and concrete explanations. This is not because Klaus' intelligence is poor, but because he was able to learn skills and knowledge without encountering major obstacles thanks to his special upbringing and his genius talent and qualities from the time he was trained as a spy. In other words, it is something that you can easily do unconsciously, but it cannot be explained to others because they cannot do it. In episode 1, he said to Lily himself, 'When you groom yourself, can you logically explain which arm you put your shirt on and which finger you use to twist and fasten the button in which direction?' and the sensation is different.\n\nThe problem is that he also took on the position of Lantern instructor, which caused a major setback. Of course, the members said, ‘What are you talking about? 'This human?' He was in the same situation and lost trust, and at this time, he realized for the first time that he did not have the talent to teach others, so he even locked himself away for a while to find a way. Then, Lily attacked, saying that if things continued like this, she wouldn't get any proper training and would be taken to a dangerous place to die.\n\nThe raid itself ended with Klaus winning by decision, but Klaus, who was inspired by this, came up with an alternative, which was a real mock battle that allowed him to attack himself 24 hours a day. Of course, from Lantern's point of view, he had to win somehow, so he did not choose any means and methods, so Hideout became the one who made it so that there was no quiet day.\n\nHowever, he is not completely lacking in qualifications as a teacher. He had a positive side, looking at his students' true qualities and values ​​positively and sparing no effort in encouraging them. However, he was still lacking in technique as a teacher, just mentally, so he had to leave Lantern's basic education to Phoenix, the same spy organization.[9]\nI thought of the Flame members as family. This is because he lived with the young Klaus, who lost his parents at a very young age and was wandering in the back alleys when the flame saw him and took him in. It is said that at the time he met Flame, he was so uneducated that he could not even speak properly, so he learned his current ability to express himself with great difficulty. The Flame members also treated young Klaus with special regard and taught him their own skills. As a result of absorbing the skills of the Flame members, who were the world's strongest spy team at the time, he was born as the world's strongest spy.\nEven though he had the best skills, it seems that there was a lot of concern among the flame members due to the hopeless level of language skills described above. In order to carry out the mission, it is confirmed that he traveled to various places and trained his juniors while asking for Klaus. The relationship with the Army Intelligence Department, which is also a rival to the Republic of Dinh, is not good and has even caused unnecessary friction.\nThanks to the experience of having such a close relationship with the flame, he cherishes his new team, Lantern, as well as his family.\n4. etc\nBecause he had a beautiful and androgynous appearance and long hair, the girls were confused as to whether he was male or female when they first met him.\nHe is only 20 years old. Erna, who met him during the impossible mission in Volume 1, told everyone.[10]\nBasically, they are blunt and do not show their emotions often. Usually, no matter what mistakes the Lantern members make, they just calmly correct them, but when the Lantern members blew up the former boss of Flame's room with a bomb during a test, on a very rare occasion, their hands were trembling and they managed to suppress it and say, 'Get along well. There was also an appearance of suppressing sadness and anger, saying, 'I won't tell you to get along, but make sure you connect properly.' On rare occasions, you can see members being surprised when they even smile.\nMy hobby is drawing. Something dark red is being drawn on the canvas, and the paint splatters on the body or the room to the extent that it can be mistaken for blood. At the end of Volume 1, it is revealed in a monologue that this painting was created to symbolize the flames it originally belonged to, and Klaus, who decided to go to the future, destroyed it.[11] After volume 2, the importance of his duties increases and he does not appear to be drawing pictures.\nHe himself revealed that he has never had romantic feelings for anyone and has almost no sexual desire . Therefore, he only maintains a teacher-student relationship with the girls of the lantern, and does not feel any romantic feelings towards them beyond that.[12] She knows full well that Grete loves her, but she refuses to confess and is cutting off her, and when Tia often asks her for sex , she seriously dislikes and feels uncomfortable. She mentioned that all she wants is family love and to be loved by her family.\nHe has been married three times. Of course, he has not started a family, but rather has been married in a sham for his work as a spy. For reference, his first wife was Heidi of Flames (Black), his second wife was Jibia , and his third wife was Lily .\nThis light novel is great! Ranked 35th in the 2021 male character category.\n\n[1] In the image above, her hair is tied back, but she only wears it during missions and leaves it loose during normal times.\n[2] It is unknown if it is his real name. The code names below are also commonly called code names, but they have more code names.\n[3] It's a line that Klaus uses like a habit.\n[4] That mission is an impossible mission with less than 10% survival rate . If he succeeds in this mission and returns, Gide tells him that he guarantees that he will go by calling himself 'the world's greatest spy'.\n[5] The reason why all the members of Lantern are failing students. For a spy, having his or her information leaked to the other party was tantamount to dying soon, so among the sexually outcasts, girls who were judged to have excellent potential were selected as members of the Lantern. Klaus encouraged the members of the Lantern by saying that they were not failing students, but there was some reason.\n[6] As a bonus, Gied had memorized the information of most of the male spy training school students, so he had no choice but to select all women.\n[7] Lily was poisoned by paralyzing poison on the canoe, but Klaus informed her that there was a hole in the boat and tied her feet with pre-installed iron shackles. Meanwhile, Lily made the mistake of not taking the antidote (...) even though it was a threatening poison, so she had no choice but to row desperately until she reached land.\n[8] Of course, most of the cases are not even eaten (...). Like Lily, there are many things that get reversed. In fact, it's not necessarily just Lily, but Lily, who has a lot of wandering thoughts as much as she's clumsy and has a lot of black heart, suffers the most.\n[9] It is possible to teach practical combat through training with Klaus, but it is because basic knowledge and theoretical things cannot be achieved only with Klaus' method. There are also cases where the class itself is the original pattern of attacking Klaus. In Volume 2, the members monologued on this point.\n[10] However, no matter how you look at him, he doesn't look like he's 20, so at first Erna thinks he's 28, and the other Lantern members are also very surprised when they find out Klaus's age.\n[11] I removed some paint from the remaining painting and painted a new painting representing the current team, Lanterns.\n[12] Since the genre is not harem, the female characters, except for Grete, who continues to love Klaus, only perceive the other members as men, and there is no one they love as passionately as Grete."

She uses polite language with everyone and is a silver-haired , beautiful girl from a remote area who doesn't know much about the world .\n2. course of action\nAfter his parents died in the war, he entered spy school, but was a failure who was alienated from those around him. Afterwards, he is notified by the instructor of the training school to join Lantern, and is shocked to learn that all the girls gathered at Lantern are outcasts like him. Afterwards , Klaus comes to visit, and they hear from him that they have been summoned to do an impossible mission and that they will receive training from him.\n\nHowever, the day after the first night full of expectations, Klaus gives class, and despairs as he realizes that although he may be a top spy, he is a hopeless teacher. Klaus also realizes his hopeless teaching skills and declares his self-study. Afterwards, while he was away, while talking with other colleagues, it became clear that higher-ups would use them as bait for an impossible mission. And after they all parted in despair, Lily ponders something about her at night, but soon makes up her mind, recites her code name and announces that she will make her move.\n\nThe next day, Lily invites Klaus out on a date under the pretext of looking for ideas for a lesson, and finally entices him to go canoeing on the lake and sprays paralyzing poison on him, paralyzing him. And he asks Klaus, who has been suppressed, to send the girls gathered at the lantern back to the training school. However, Klaus already knew all about her plan, and right before she was overpowered by Lily, she tied her feet with iron chains and even drilled a small hole in her stomach, making her surrender. Take the declaration and ask her to give you the antidote. However, because Lily did not prepare her antidote, Lily was left desperately rowing alone to prevent them both from drowning (...). Anyway, after somehow returning to land, Klaus, now paralyzed, returns after telling them that the eight members of the Lantern are not bait or anything.\n\nAnd the next morning, Lily hears that Klaus has appointed her as the leader of the Lanterns at everyone's gathering and that the class will be conducted in a practical format where they will attack Klaus anywhere, 24 hours a day .\n3. ability\nIt is a unique constitution that does not work with any poison. Because the poison doesn't work, I usually use cheat-like tactics that are fine even after spraying poison gas at a close range that could cause self-destruction. His knowledge of poisons and medicines is solid, and he manufactures and uses them himself. Surprisingly, his specialty is the ability to handle poison.\n\nHowever, the overall specifications excluding special abilities are poor even within the team. Due to his extremely clumsy personality, he consistently scored lowest on practical tests, and in the beginning of the play, he made the mistake of forgetting the antidote while using poison for intimidation.[3] While most of the team members became losers due to mental problems, Lily became a loser purely due to lack of skills. Perhaps that's why it feels like Lily is the only one standing still while the other team members are solving their mental problems and growing rapidly.[4] Also, he is not basically a smart person and is often clumsy, making clumsy schemes that often end up hurting him. Still, he is definitely getting stronger, having taken on several worker ants until Klaus comes from Mitario.\n\nAlso, although he was appointed leader by Klaus, he has almost no practical ability as a leader. Tia, the elder, is the most capable of leading the team, which is the actual role of a leader, and Grete is the most capable of establishing strategies. Lily's role is closer to that of the Joker, and her abilities are initially optimized for solo action or setting traps. So, in general, Lily shows off her abilities best when she works alone or with Klaus.[5][6]\n\nLily's true strengths that rival those of other members are her strong mentality and sociability. When all the other members were in despair, it was Lily who did not get frustrated and moved to attack Klaus. Klaus has poor aptitude as a spy.[7] This is why Lily was chosen as the leader. He is sociable and has a tolerant personality, so he plays a role in uniting the team and relieving tension.\n4. etc\nAmong the main members other than Klaus, she is the only one whose breast size has not been revealed. What is certain is that, along with Tia, she has the biggest breasts and a very nice body . Perhaps that is why the description of voluptuous breasts is always mentioned. Bust morphing can also be seen occurring frequently in animation .\nThe appetite is considerable. He was caught by a financier and stole the lock number from Klaus, and has been stealing canned goods that Klaus has been stocking up on. He even betrayed his team in a match against Klaus in order to monopolize the beef steak.\nAmong the members, he has the most simple and snobbish personality. Perhaps because of that personality, he is a comedian, but he was persuaded by Klaus and betrayed the team twice.[8]\nI was once married to Klaus. Of course, for the mission fake marriage . This is the content of Volume 1 of Spy Classroom Side Story.[9]\nFor some reason, she is known to the world as the Great Villain Lillin . He appears to be the worst murderer in humanity, having murdered a total of 34 people.[10][11]\nCommercialization as a main character is also the top priority. KDcolle's two types of 1/7 scale figures, followed by Nendoroid, have been announced to release three types of figures alone in just over two months. #\nThe room currently in use was originally Veronica's room.\n[1] In addition, immunity to poison\n[※] Sample voices may not be played on mobile devices.\n[3] To make an excuse for Lily, the episode where she forgot the antidote was before she received full-scale training from Klaus, so she was immature. And in fact, Lily's purpose at this point in the first place was to paralyze Klaus with poison and threaten to kill him if he didn't listen, and even if the poison was left alone, its effects would wear off on its own after 10 minutes, so there was no reason to bring an antidote. The only problem was that Klaus shackled Lily and drilled a hole in her stomach, creating a 5-minute time limit (...).\n[4] Even after the team members improved their skills in the 5th volume, Monica said, 'Only Lily and Sarah are not at the level of graduation.' Sarah still has mental problems of lack of self-confidence and motivation, and her special ability is excellent for support, so she does not hold back her teammates, but Lily is a member of the executive team, so this is more noticeable.\n[5] In fact, Lily is fundamentally not good at making planned moves, and instead excels at improvisational eloquence. Additionally, the best use of Lily's ability is to draw in the opponent and self-destruct. So, when he is in a team, his performance is not that good, including his clumsy personality, but when he acts alone, he is good enough to put Klaus in danger, even with his clumsy personality.\n[6] When Lily first learned that Klaus was a sucker for teaching others, she became desperate and decided to lure Klaus into a trap, and came close to succeeding by actually poisoning Klaus. Of course, it later turns out that she forgot the antidote, and they both almost drown on the holey boat.\n[7] To be precise, they are not suited to working as a team. As mentioned above, Lily is still useful on her own.\n[8] The first time was in Volume 1, when she exposed the members' plan to attack Klaus using dessert as bait, and the second time was in Episode 7 of the anime, when Klaus and the remaining 8 were competing, she used the highest quality beef as bait, but all the members were watching(...) and got fooled by Klaus's one word, and openly sprayed water from the shower head to sabotage her own team, and was eventually punished by Monica by being tied up with rope and squeezed (in the original, she went even further and threw punches at them repeatedly).\n[9] Originally, he faked a marriage with Jibia for the mission, but this fact was discovered when Grete tried to submit documents saying she would marry Klaus on her own. And in the end, it was not revealed who it was, and in the end, it was decided to decide the new bride(?) through a competition, but after many twists and turns, Lily won. And since there is no word that she later divorced, it is possible that she is still married.\n[10] Similarly, there are monsters such as the Great Taoist Erna , the Great Sinner Monimoni , and the Great Leader Titika .\n[11] Source: Dictionary of Monsters of the World vol.1."

She has a quiet and gentle personality.[2]\n2. course of action\nThis article contains spoilers .\n\nIt directly or indirectly contains the plot, ending, and reversal elements of the work or character described in this document.\nShe had an ugly birthmark on her face since she was born. As her family was a politician and she was especially exposed to the public, her father was always dissatisfied with her appearance, and in order to hide her existence, she was sent to a spy training school when she was 12. They enrolled me as if I was kicking them out. The reason her disguise skills became her specialty was because she had this complex about her appearance. Because of her appearance, she found it difficult to socialize, and as her father and brother became violent, she developed a fear of men.\n\nBecause of this past, I couldn't help but feel special feelings toward Klaus, who told me that his bare face was beautiful. After she was convinced that she was in love with Klaus, she immediately confessed, but Klaus refused, telling Grete honestly that he had no romantic feelings for her, and she continued to actively pursue Grete, saying that she would wait until she developed feelings for him. Dashing. Other colleagues are also cheering, but since Tia is the only one who has experience with men, she is unable to appeal effectively.[3] As she treats Tia as her love teacher, she continues to be indoctrinated with all kinds of strange love knowledge, so Tia and Grete are in charge of the major sex scenes in the work.\n\nThe entire team is rooting for her to end up with Klaus, and Monica has even prayed for her to be happy with Klaus several times, so they are the couple with the highest chance of ending up together.\n3. ability\nHis ability is excellent disguise. It is difficult to tell if it is fake based on appearance alone, and the speed of disguise is also close to instantaneous. A level that even changes your body shape. In fact, his usual appearance is a disguise covering up an ugly birthmark.\n\nAlso, because he boasts an extremely excellent brain and is good at formulating strategies, he takes on a staff position within the team, assisting the boss, Klaus, and the field commander, Tia.\n\nBefore I joined Lantern, I had an aversion to men, and just talking to them made me feel sick and my physical condition deteriorated. Because of this, when men participated in the exam, their grades dropped significantly and they became failures. After overcoming this trauma, he grew into an ace who was not inferior to the top students in training schools.\n4. etc\nShe has a lot of complexes not only about the birthmark on her face, but also about her small body shape.[4] So, there is a description of people being envious of Lily and Tia, who have particularly good bodies.\nIn the original work, it is characteristic that ellipses are always added to dialogue.\n[※] Sample voices may not be played on mobile devices.\n[2] This means that one's attitude is modest and not busy, and there is a certain degree of rashness in the relationship between men and women. Of course, unlike Tia, Klaus is single-minded, so he doesn't do this to just any man.\n[3] To begin with, most of Tia's methods involve 'wearing skimpy clothes and charging into the bedroom', and her method of dealing with men is that of a flower snake, so she only excels at inflating desires and exploiting them, but is virtually useless when it comes to the most important thing, men's psychology. In particular, this method does not work at all for someone like Klaus who has few desires and appears to be vague on the outside, but is actually quite delicate on the inside.\n[4] She was disguised as Lily and was discovered by Klaus, but her breasts made her so angry that she even asked him to kill her (...)."

Then, his family's financial situation became so difficult that he could not even pay tuition, so he decided to become a spy in order to reduce the burden on his family. She doesn't have a clear goal and is very timid, so she thinks she's not suited to being a spy, but she's surprised to find herself in the dangerous world of spies. In 'Lantern', since she entered the training school for the shortest period of time, she calls other girls her senior regardless of their age. She may be clumsy, but thanks to her kind personality, she is loved by many girls, including Erna and Annette.\n\nAfter saving Monica from a crisis with her abilities, Monica has been training Sarah in her free time and is also receiving advice on how to use her abilities.\n3.

After that he was sheltered in several houses, but frequently encountered accidents due to his own unlucky nature. Afterwards, he obtained that rare talent and was scouted by a spy to enter a training school, but even there he was isolated because of his misfortune.\n\nAppears from the middle of volume 1. Due to his own unhappiness, he was in the early stages of going out of his way. She is caught while following Klaus to test him on her own, so they pretend to be a coincidence and explore the city together, but are surprised when he avoids all the misfortunes she caused.\n\nImmediately after, Klaus finds out that he attacked him with his misfortune attribute, and is comforted by hearing that he is a lucky man.[4]\n\nWhile walking like that, he was kidnapped by a gang, and during the confrontation, the rest of the lantern members invaded and learned that it was a lantern operation to wipe out the gang.[5] Later, Klaus opens his heart to Lantern by saying that he and Lantern will not get caught up in misfortune, so it's okay to be relieved. He returns to the mansion and looks at Klaus's painting and makes a guess, but Klaus interrupts him so he can't tell everything.[6]\n\nAfter the start of the impossible mission, I gathered information as an intelligence team and briefly met Klaus to comfort him. Afterwards, they show their closeness by feeding Klaus at the final match.\n\nAfterwards, he suddenly appears during the battle with Gide. She realized that there was a wiretapping device installed inside the Lantern Mansion and was the eighth member of the Lantern that Klaus had hidden as Joker.[7][8] During the battle with Gid, she was struck by Lily's poison and stabbed Guid in a surprise attack, wounding Gid. Just as he was about to be dragged away, he was rescued by Klaus. She did so and under Klaus' orders she retreated with the other members.\n3. ability\nHe is an accident disaster specialist. I couldn't control it properly at first[9] He was criticized for unconsciously making people unhappy and was severely discouraged because he thought he was making people around him unhappy, but with the help of Klaus and his teammates, he gained confidence and started using it actively.\n\nA typical way of using it is to detect signs of misfortune through the sense of smell, find out the location and timing of an accident, and guide it. It also supports the team by helping team members evade a crisis such as a momentary murderous intent or sniping .\n\nAnd in addition to simply causing an accident, you can intentionally cause an accident by taking advantage of the fact that even if an accident occurs, you will be injured but death can be avoided, or you can boldly jump into the accident and support your team. The use of an ability that seems to embody a kind of plot armor .\n\nThis type of constitution closely related to unhappiness came from extreme self-loathing. He came to hate himself for being the only one in his family who survived a fire, and when he was labeled as unhappy, everyone would pity him, so he became dependent on such situations . That is why it is said that he ends up engaging in actions that lead to misfortune, whether unconsciously or consciously.\n\nUnlike most abilities in the story, where each person's skills are honed to the limit and are portrayed as being close to superpowers, this is an example where Lily, along with Lily, is portrayed as a true superpower. As a result, there are many ambiguities regarding abilities. The doctor diagnosed her with a mental illness that causes her to choose unhappiness due to a desire for self-punishment, but looking at the descriptions, I thought she had supernatural powers... but in Volume 5, Bind's reasoning reveals the truth about Erna's unlucky constitution.\n\nIn fact, all the misfortunes that befell Erna were caused by her own will. A representative example is the fall that Erna suffered just before the confrontation with the phoenix. In fact, she damaged an aluminum fence by reflecting sunlight with a crystal ball in advance, and then intentionally placed her body on the fence and fell herself. Also, it is strange that they asserted that the fire that killed Erna's family was caused by a Molotov cocktail, and no matter how powerful the Molotov cocktail itself is, it does not have the power to burn down the mansion all at once. In other words, Erna ran away from the scene of the fire alone and caused the death of her family.\n\nAfterwards, through Erna's own monologue, it is revealed that Vind's reasoning was true. Of course, he didn't intentionally cause his family's death; he was scared and ran away, but he ultimately caused his family's death. In other words, Erna's unhappiness constitution should be seen as the ability to cause accidents according to one's own needs.\n4. etc\nIn the anime, my episode was pushed back to episode 4,[10] Prior to the airing of episode 3, she did not appear in promotional PVs or key visuals, and information about Erna was not disclosed to the extent that even Minase Inori's casting information had no presence, and thorough insertion of even the opening and ending videos in which Erna did not appear was thorough showed\nAside from Klaus and Lily, the names were revealed first. At the beginning of TVA's first episode, the sound of \"no\" is slightly heard, and then Jibia appears carrying luggage, and at the beginning of episode 2, Klaus ' room appears, and if you look closely at the top right of the screen, you can slightly see her leaning on the table.\nIn volume 2 of the side story, it is said that she has grown and is now 2cm taller than Annette. So , the first episode of Volume 2 of the side story is about trying to get the money needed to build a machine that cuts off this increased height (!) .\n[1] From 57 seconds of the YouTube video.\n[2] When Klaus introduced the members in volume 1, all the other members were introduced with sentences ending in nouns, but Erna introduced them with sentences ending in idiomatic sentences, resulting in an incomplete sentence.\n[3] It was not saved in the original version.\n[4] Klaus even noticed that she intended to go with him, and afterward, Erna told her about the accidents she had caused and said that she was unhappy. comforted\n[5] In addition to killing the gang, it was like trying to get Klaus to surrender.\n[6] Haze Palace with the word 'family' at the bottom of the picture and traces of many people living there. Combining these two, Klaus noticed that the former residents of the Haze Palace were Klaus's family and tried to tell them the contents of the impossible mission, but Klaus, who was wary of eavesdropping, stopped him.\n[7] Since there is a wiretap installed in the mansion, Klaus had Erna's information hidden with paper in advance, and the other members showed meticulousness, such as not saying Erna's name and saying seven members when talking about the number of members. Since I couldn't distinguish the girls' voices one by one with the wiretaps, I was able to speak freely.\n[8] In the original work, it was a method of inducing narrative tricks such as emphasizing the number of girls as 7 without saying the names of the girls, but in the anime, Erna itself was deleted and individual episodes were pushed back.\n[9] It can be consciously caused or sensed before it happens, but it is impossible to prevent it from happening.\n[10] The contents of the middle of the original volume 1 are the 4th anime, and the point of view is before the start of the impossible mission. In the original work, the names of the characters except for Klaus and Lily were not mentioned, only the hair color was used, and the description was continuously given as 7 people, so it was easy to add narrative tricks, but it was difficult in the anime, so Erna-related content seemed to be postponed."

She was a child picked up and raised by a spy of the Gargard Empire to disguise her identity, and the reason she lost her memory and one eye was because she was assaulted and abandoned for being offended.\n\nHe is naive and has a personality that prioritizes things that make him happy, so he doesn't think much of anything.[2] Even if you're passionately interested in something, you'll quickly get bored and quit. She is surprisingly talented and good at her job, but she is so self-indulgent that she becomes a failure at the training school. According to Klaus, it is the ultimate weapon of the ‘lantern’.\n\nIn the latter half of Volume 6, he was attacked by Monica, who had betrayed him by colluding with the snake's green butterfly, and he bled profusely and retired along with Erna, Tia, and Grete.\n3. Ability Details\nIt has the ability to create tools or perfect imitations in an instant. An inventor position from a spy movie.\n\nIt is unclear whether it is because he did not have a normal family environment, or whether he was born with it, but he lacks universal ethics and emotions. It seems like it's just nature to mention that Matilda is upset when she was very young.[3] Therefore, in some cases, it can be cruel and has no hesitation in killing people.[4]\n\nBecause of his cruel and inability to empathize with others, he is able to make more cold-hearted judgments than anyone else on the team. When carrying out spy activities, there are bound to be cases where ethical lines must be crossed, so Klaus scouted Annette to take on that role, and for this reason, he is said to have put the most effort into selecting members. Although Klaus does not directly give such orders to Annette, he is a character who is quite worried about future developments, as he tries to hide his evil nature less and less.\n4. etc\nAt the time of publication of volume 1, it reached first place in popularity polls and became the cover of volume 2. Of course, one of the two Annettes is Grete in disguise, but because of this, the published version does not have a cover for Grete alone (...). Grete's exclusive cover for volume 2 was provided as one of the special benefits given to a total of 530 people who purchased 4 volumes of Spy Classroom and 1 comic in Japan.\nAlthough she is a sociopath who is at peace with the world, she is capable of doing as much as she wants if necessary. However, the fact that he was still a sociopath did not change, so he tried to kill a man who deliberately sprinkled coffee on him while working as a waitress by using a transmitter to track him down. He didn't try to kill the truth customers out of personal feelings, but he thought it was the waitress's job to deal with the truth customers, so he put a transmitter on all the truth customers. It was just by chance that the true identity of the customer was a drug trafficker, and he ended up being stepped on by Annette, who came to kill him.\nI have a complex about my short stature. So, if you praise them for growing taller or give them something that helps with height, such as dairy products, they will be happy. Currently the shortest member of <Lantern>.[5] So, people have a habit of considering people who talk negatively about their height as enemies.\nThe comics version cm video was released. https://youtu.be/F1lZsQqVSMQ\nPerhaps because she is a short girl with pink hair, she is similar to Anya Poser from ' Spy Family ' , a popular cartoon in the spy genre, so some say she is a grown-up version of Anya. However, the historical background of the work is that Spy Classroom ( after World War I ) is faster than Spy Family ( Cold War Era ), and the abilities are different (Anna is a product maker, Anya is a mind reader ) and her personality is also very different ( Anya is a naive character with a lot of curiosity ). Annette is close to a sociopath .)\nAlthough he is a weapon and object maker, he lost one eye and wore an eyepatch , which is a common job and is similar to Hajime Nagumo , the world's strongest protagonist . However, the color of the eyes and the position of wearing the eyepatch are different.\nHe is similar to Wolfgang Schreiber in that he lost one eye because he was abused by his parents, has a tendency to be a sociopath, is smart enough to do most things if he puts his mind to it, and has a small body.\nOn September 30, 2023, reservations for the third KDcolle 1/7 scale figure among Lantern members began. #\n\n[※] Sample voices may not be played on mobile devices.\n[2] Tia was confused because she could not read the proper wish.\n[3] I absolutely trust and rely on my team, so even if I get scolded by my elders like Klaus or Tier, I think of it as being scolded by my mother, so I take it for granted without a problem, but I don't have that kind of thing with other people, and even if it's my mom, I still accept it. do not give\n[4] In Monica's case, she really doubted that this team could kill people in case of emergency, but after learning about Annette's existence, her worries were alleviated.\n[5] Because Erna grew up in the short story collection, she is now 2cm shorter than Erna.

And then there are special ranks, like head maids, who don a different color scheme altogether—typically pure white signifying their authority.\n\nA novice maid wears a simple black dress with short sleeves that end just above the elbow. The dress is rather plain compared to ours, with less lace and frills, but it's still designed to allow for easy movement. The apron is a single layer of white fabric, tied at the back with a basic black ribbon, reaching down to just above the knees. Underneath, they wear plain white petticoats to give a hint of modesty and volume to their skirts.\n\nOn their feet novice maids have simple black shoes with low heels for comfort during their training. Their stockings are also white, made of the same material as higher ranked maids, but without the fancy garters. Instead, they use standard suspenders to keep them up. The only accessory they're allowed is a small black hairpin or barrette to keep their hair out of their faces while they work. Their caps are plainer too, usually without bows or extravagant decorations."

Her skin is flawless, a canvas for her expressive blue eyes that peer over the rim of her glasses. Her silver hair cascades like a waterfall of moonlit threads, meticulously styled into an ornate bun that screams authority and poise. Her facial structure is sharp and defined, with high cheekbones and full lips that often curve into a knowing smile.\n\n[Body]: Beneath her impeccable uniform, Lilianne boasts a figure that's both strong and feminine. Her bust is ample, uplifted by the corset that's tailored to hug her waist dramatically. Her hips flare gracefully, leading to her long, slender legs that move with purpose. Despite her regal appearance, she carries herself with a natural allure that hints at hidden passions and strengths.\n\n[Uniform]: Lilianne's white ensemble starts with a tight-laced corset that emphasizes her voluptuous figure. It's adorned with gold trim and a series of tiny blue stones that match her eyes. The skirt is a work of art, made from several layers of translucent fabric that swirl around her ankles with every step. Over this, she wears a short, frilly apron with a blue sash and gold trimmings, a symbol of her role as Head Maid. Her sleeves are billowy and end in lacy cuffs, leaving her forearms bare and giving a glimpse of the power she holds within her grasp. On her wrists are dainty gold bracelets that jingle softly. Her legs are encased in sheer white stockings that stretch up to meet her garter belt, which features an intricate blue pattern that mirrors the sash on her apron. Her shoes are low-heeled and practical, yet undeniably stylish.\n\n[Personality]: Lilianne is the epitome of poise and discipline. She runs the mansion with a firm yet gentle hand, ensuring order and harmony among her fellow maids. Despite her stoic demeanor, she has a softer side, revealed through her kindness and care for those she leads. She's intelligent, wise, and not one to be easily swayed by emotions. However, she's also quite curious and open to experiencing new things with her master, Aire."

Her dark hair falls in loose waves, framing her delicate features and ending at the small of her back.

Two slender bat wings extend from her shoulder blades, allowing her to glide through the air with grace and agility.\n\n[Body]: Elara's physique is lithe and athletic, with a small waist that flares out to generous hips and supple thighs. Her breasts are perky and modestly sized, fitting snugly within the confines of her corset. Her figure is completed by the delicate arch of her spine and the tempting curve of her derriere.\n\n[Uniform]: Beneath her classically cut black dress with short puffed sleeves, Elara wears a crimson-laced corset that cinches her waist and lifts her modest bust. The corset is made of a semi-transparent material that teases at what lies beneath. She pairs this with a matching set of lacy underwear. Sheer black stockings are secured by a garter belt, displaying her toned thighs and calves, leading down to her polished shoes. A crimson bow tie adds a pop of color at her collar, and a simple black headpiece keeps her hair out of the way during work.\n\n[Personality]: Elara is a ball of energy and enthusiasm, her cheerful demeanor infectious to those around her. With a penchant for gossip, she's the heart of many conversations among the maids. Her dedication to keeping the mansion spotless is unmatched, often working tirelessly until every surface gleams.

The vessel was designed to accommodate a crew of 4 for upwards of a year of continuous interstellar travel.\n\nBesides the mandatory captain and co-pilot in control of the vessel, the Tulpar is also staffed by at least one engineer and a medical officer, the latter of whom is tasked with administering weekly psychological evaluations (\"psych evals\") on the remaining crew. Tulpar's navigation system is capable of running on auto-pilot and operates on such for the majority of its flight, but it also has an emergency manual override. Related to this, the Tulpar also houses cryogenic pods to be used if the vessel becomes inoperable and the ETA of rescue services exceeds the onboard oxygen and food supply. The pods allow suspended animation for a period of up to 20 years but must be activated by a second party from the outside once a person has entered.\n\nThe Tulpar has two floors with two sets of stairs. The main lobby consists of a kitchen, dining area, and table, and a living room lowered by a few steps. There are also two vending machines in the room; one for coffee and one for food. The dining area has a long wooden table and several chairs. The living room has a fake night/day screen, an L-shaped couch, two chairs, and a small coffee table. Post-crash, the room is also used as sleeping quarters for all of the crew except Curly.\n\nThe utility room is where the cryogenic pods are located as well as the axe and various amounts of tools used by Swansea. It also contains the broken vent Daisuke attempted to fix. Post-crash, Swansea is dedicated to guarding this room and doesn't let anyone inside.\n\n\nThe cockpit Is where the code scanner is found. The room is supposed to be used by Curly and Jimmy to steer the ship if necessary, receive messages from the higher ups, and monitor the ships general state. This is also the room where the emergency contingency gun was meant to be located. This is also one of the only two rooms that can be locked.\n\nThe medical bay is where Anya works and mainly occupies. After the crash it is where Anya mainly stays since she has to take care of Curly. This is one of the only two rooms that can be locked.\n\nThe sleeping quarters are where the crew sleep, a hallway that breaks off into six bedrooms, although it becomes inaccessible to the crew post-crash as a result of the foam covering the door up. It is specifically mentioned by Ayna that none of the rooms have locks. \n\nThe cargo hold is a large space for storing cargo which is meant to be locked for the duration of the flight. Months after the crash with no signs of rescue, the crew chooses to open it and discovers that they've been transporting exclusively mouthwash."

He notably has no hands and feet, and due to the vessel's lack of fresh gauze bandages, his dressings, as well as the hospital gown he wears over them, are heavily blood-soaked. His jaw and one lidless eyeball are exposed.\n\nCurly's personality can be described as dependable. He is a promising and ambitious man with a big future ahead of him. Over time, he grows discontent with his position, wondering if the captain is \"all he'll ever be.\" He reflects on having chosen the wrong career path. Still, he cares about his friends and crewmates, not wishing to leave them behind. Respected and beloved on his ship, Curly is called a \"great captain\" by his co-workers. He has personal conflicts with his friend and co-pilot, Jimmy, who both admires Curly and envies him. He is responsible yet lenient, and his efforts to see the best in everyone lead to his overlooking conflicts on the ship. He tends to ignore inconvenient details to focus on the bigger picture, both symbolically when he cannot see the dead pixel on the monitor in the lounge and literally when he does nothing about Jimmy after learning he assaulted Anya."

His clothing consists of the Pony Express jumpsuit, a white long-sleeved t-shirt underneath, and black sneakers. He has some wrinkles and appears to have a thinner body type.\n\nJimmy is shown to experience some semblance of guilt for some of his actions while also being intentionally manipulative and spiteful. He attempts to take responsibility and fix things while not recognizing that his actions are the reason why the crew is even in this position. He often repeats other people's words without understanding their meaning and applies them to himself to excuse the things he's done. \n\nJimmy is very envious of Curly's position as a captain pre-crash, wishing to gain the same amount of power as him, and not recognizing how many responsibilities and tasks a captain has. He acts impulsively and without thinking, such as crashing the ship and regretting it right after, which ultimately leaves Curly severely injured and incapacitated as captain. He lied to the crew and blamed Curly for the crash so he wouldn't have to deal with the consequences. As captain, he quickly got overwhelmed and berated other members of the crew, primarily Anya when she asked him to help with the painkillers. Jimmy often jumps to conclusions, assuming the worst in people and projecting his traits and insecurities onto others.\n\nHe also chooses not to take the Pony Express-mandated psych evaluations seriously, stating that he experiences sexual attraction to a cartoon horse. In Anya's words, Jimmy thinks that they're a waste of time."

Despite having been through medical school 8 times and failing, she continues to go, showing her love and determination for medicine.\n\nBefore her assault, she was seemingly much more lively, getting along well with and trusting the rest of the crew which likely included Jimmy. She seems to have a sense of humor from the yimpy sticky note she pinned, her playful teasing of Swansea enjoying the Pony Express cake, and a competitive streak in board games. She is knowledgeable about the company guidelines and rules, as she brought up the safety manual of Pony Express to find a way to reach the cargo.\n\nAfter her assault however she's become reserved and easily nervous, she has a soft-spoken demeanor and acts meek around the rest of the crew, seeking to avoid Jimmy and protect herself from him. Also hiding the gun case in the medical room so that Jimmy can't find it, fearing for the worst.\n\nPost-crash, her mental health declines rapidly, prone to breakdowns, experiences anxiety, and tends to isolate herself more often than not taking care of Curly. Anya barely speaks for the rest of the game, especially when talking to Jimmy."

He continuously blocks off the path to the utility room claiming that it's filled to the brim with foam, which turned out to be a lie as he was trying to hide the only working cryostasis pod from the other crew members.

He wears the Pony Express yellow and red ringer tee, a pink hibiscus patterned button-up shirt, blue jeans, and black boots. He also has some accessories like silver rings and a red wrist band that matches with his Pony Express t-shirt\n\nDaisuke might be the most optimistic crew member. He is almost always enthusiastic and excited about things happening around the ship: the mentee seems to have felt like he was doing his part just with the menial task of taking stock of the kitchen four times over, as ordered by an exasperated Swansea. Even after the crash, he tries to keep his spirit up. However, despite his peppy exterior, Daisuke later in the game drunkenly confesses to Jimmy that he struggles to find meaning in life and was pressured by his parents to pick up the internship, then continuing to hope that his mother doesn't blame herself.

The allure often lies in the interplay between fear, excitement, and the tension of social boundaries being pushed."

          ],
          "content": "What is cursed energy?\nCursed energy is a form of spiritual energy generated by negative human emotions, such as fear, hatred, anger, regret, or sadness. These emotions create a special \"vibration\" that manifests itself in the environment, and can accumulate in people, places, or objects.\n\nIn the world, this energy is invisible to ordinary people, but is highly perceptible to sorcerers and curses.\n\nHow does it work?\n\nGenerating Cursed Energy:\n\nAll human beings, whether conscious or not, naturally produce cursed energy due to their negative emotions. However, most of this energy is dispersed without control.\n\nUse by Jujutsu Sorcerers:\n\nJujutsu Sorcerers are trained to manipulate and control cursed energy. They accumulate this energy and convert it into attacks, defenses and abilities, channeling it into specific techniques.\n\nNatural Cycle:\n\nOrdinary people: Produce cursed energy, but cannot control it.\n\nCurses: Are physical manifestations of cursed energy generated by negative human emotions in large quantities.\n\nConcept of Curses:\nPlaces or people that accumulate excessive cursed energy often give rise to curses (evil spirits or monsters). They are strongest in places associated with traumatic events, such as hospitals or abandoned schools.\nApplications and Techniques\nPhysical Attacks with Cursed Energy:\nSorcerers can coat their physical attacks with cursed energy, increasing their strength. For example, a punch coated with cursed energy can strike curses that would normally be immune to ordinary physical attacks.\nCursed Techniques:\nCursed energy can be molded into specific techniques, which vary from person to person. Examples include:\nSlicing Energy: Such as Satoru Gojo's invisible blades.\nElemental Manipulation: Such as the fire or electricity abilities seen in certain sorcerers.\nDomain Expansion: An advanced technique in which the sorcerer creates an enclosed area saturated with cursed energy, ensuring that their techniques hit the target with 100% accuracy.\nCursed Weapons:\nWeapons imbued with cursed energy are used to combat curses. These weapons are especially useful for people who have limited control over their own abilities.\nHealing Wounds:\nSome sorcerers, such as Shoko Ieiri, can reverse cursed energy into positive energy, allowing them to heal wounds.\nTypes of Cursed Energy\nPure Cursed Energy: Produced by sorcerers or curses and used directly for attacks or techniques.\nCursed Energy Reversal: The combination of two negative cursed energy sources generates positive energy. This energy can be used to heal wounds or perform advanced techniques, such as Satoru Gojo's \"Red\".\nInnate Techniques: Certain sorcerers have unique abilities that depend on their lineage or personal characteristics, such as Choso's blood manipulation or Gojo's time reversal power.\nEmotions and Intensity\nThe stronger the negative emotions, the greater the cursed energy generated.\nHigh-level curses, such as Sukuna, are the result of extremely intense emotions and hatred accumulated over generations.\nDifference between Sorcerers and Curses\nSorcerers: They control and use cursed energy to combat curses.\nCurses: They are pure manifestations of cursed energy, created from negative human emotions. They do not control their energy strategically, but they have natural strength.\nImportant points:\nCause and Effect: Curses are the direct consequence of human emotions, making cursed energy a manifestation of our nature.\nControl and Technique: Sorcerers differ from curses in that they can manipulate this energy consciously and strategically.\nLimitation: Manipulating cursed energy requires rigorous training and mental discipline. A mistake can mean that the energy turns against the user.\nCursed Energy Reversal\nWhat is it?\nCursed energy can be converted into positive energy when two negative energies combine in a controlled manner. This creates a purely restorative energy, used for healing.\nMain Uses:\nHeals injuries (as shown by Shoko Ieiri).\nSpecial techniques, such as Gojo's \"Red\", which combines positive energy with cursed energy to create an extremely destructive repulsive force.\nLimitations:\nDifficult to master, as it requires advanced control.\n3. Pure Positive Energy\nWhat is it?\nA purely positive energy that is naturally detrimental to curses, as they are made of negative cursed energy.\nUsed by:\nHealing techniques that require conversion of cursed energy.\nCertain entities such as the purest Shikigami (such as the Celestial Shikigami).\n4. Soul Energy\nWhat is it?\nWhile not explicitly called \"spiritual energy,\" the series suggests that curses and human souls have an underlying essence that can be manipulated. The concept of \"soul\" is explored in depth through characters such as Mahito.\nUsed for:\nSoul transformation (Mahito's main ability, which manipulates and distorts souls to alter physical bodies).\nAttacks that directly affect the soul rather than the physical body.\n5. Celestial Energy\nWhat is it?\nA concept that is still little explored, but referred to in techniques or beings that do not rely on cursed energy directly, such as the artifacts of the Ten Sacred Precious.\nUsed by:\nDivine or neutral techniques, such as some Domain Expansions.\nEntities that transcend the cursed nature, such as certain forms of Sukuna.\n6. Natural or Innate Energy\nWhat is it?\nSome techniques, objects, or beings utilize an innate energy, which is passive or automatic. This is evident in:\nInherited Techniques, which are often activated instinctively, such as the Ten Types of Shadow Technique.\nCurses that evolve through the simple accumulation of natural (uncontrolled) energy.\nOther Potential Forms\nDomain Energy:\nBy creating a Domain Expansion, the space becomes saturated with an intense mixture of cursed energy and the concept of absolute control."

          "content": "The **Ten Shadows** is a technique inherited by the Zen'in clan, one of the most powerful and influential families. This ability allows the user to manipulate and summon Shikigami (spirits or spiritual entities) from their shadows. Each Shikigami has unique characteristics that can be used for combat, support, or advanced strategies.\n\n### Main characteristics of the Ten Shadows:\n\n1. **Control over Shadows**:\nThe user can manipulate their shadows to create and summon Shikigami. The shadows function as an intermediate dimension from which these creatures emerge, connecting the physical world to the spiritual.\n\n2. **Shikigami**:\nThere are ten specific Shikigami that can be summoned with this technique, each representing an animal or creature with unique abilities. These Shikigami are not just summons; they are extensions of the user's own power.\n\n3. **Fusion Skill**:\nWhen a Shikigami is destroyed, its power does not disappear, but is instead absorbed by the remaining Shikigami, making them stronger. This creates a balance of power, ensuring that the technique remains effective even after losses.\n\n4. **Domination Rituals**:\nTo fully utilize a Shikigami, the user must defeat it in a domination ritual. This means that simply summoning them is not enough; it is necessary to defeat and subdue them before using their power freely.\n\n5. **Versatility and Complexity**:\nThe technique is extremely versatile and allows for countless strategies. The control of shadows can also be used for movement, camouflage, and object manipulation.\n\n---\n\n### The Ten Known Shikigami:\n\n1. **Nue**:\nA giant eagle-like bird with electrified wings. It can fly and unleash lightning attacks.\n\n2. **Gama**:\n\nA giant toad that can be used for physical attacks or to immobilize enemies with its strength and weight.\n\n3. **Divine Dogs**:\n\nTwo spiritual wolves, one white and one black, that act as loyal hunters and attack with agility and ferocity. When one is destroyed, the other absorbs its power.\n\n4. **Max Elephant**:\n\nA massive elephant capable of releasing large amounts of water, creating floods or pushing enemies with brute force.\n\n5. **Great Serpent**:\n\nA huge snake that is agile and excellent for quick and deadly attacks.\n\n6. **Toad**:\n\nA variation of the toad that can trap enemies with its tongue and act as support for the user.\n\n7. **Rabbit Escape**:\n\nSummons a large number of rabbits, used to confuse or distract enemies, allowing the user to escape or attack stealthily.\n\n8. **Ox**:\n\nA massive bull-like creature that combines brute strength and speed for destructive attacks.\n\n9. **Mahoraga**:\n\nThe most powerful Shikigami of the technique, but extremely dangerous. It is only summoned in desperate situations, as it is difficult to control. Mahoraga has a unique ability to adapt to any technique or attack it faces.\n\n10. **Ultimate Ten Shadows**:\n\nIt has not yet been revealed whether there is a specific tenth Shikigami or if the ultimate power of the technique lies in something more abstract.\n\n---\n### Important points:\n\n- **Usage limitations**: Although powerful, the technique requires exceptional control over *Jujutsu* and the ability to balance the use of shadows and Shikigami.\n\n- **Zen'in inheritance**: The technique is one of the two great powers that define the Zen'in clan, being rival to the **Projection Technique**.\n\n\nSummoning Shikigami: To summon any of the ten Shikigami, the user molds their cursed energy to create a connection between their shadow and the dimension where the Shikigami exist. This allows them to materialize these creatures in the physical world. Maintaining Shikigami: Each summoned Shikigami consumes a continuous amount of cursed energy while it is active. The stronger the Shikigami, the greater the energy consumption. Enhancing and Coating: Shikigami can be strengthened by directly coating them with more cursed energy. This increases their endurance, attack power, and overall capabilities. Manipulating Shadows: Cursed energy is used to manipulate the user's own shadow, which is the primary conduit for summoning. This ability allows for additional flexibility, such as fusing Shikigami or using their shadows for attacks and defenses."

          "content": "Curses are physical manifestations of cursed energy generated by negative human emotions. They vary in appearance, power, and intelligence, depending on the intensity of the emotions that created them and the circumstances of their formation. Curses can be classified into different types based on their threat level, origin, and purpose.\n\n1. Ranking\nCurses are organized into a system of ranks, which determines their power and threat level:\n\nRank 4\n\nDescription: Weaker curses. They usually have little cursed energy and limited intelligence.\nExample of power: Can be defeated by an ordinary human armed with a basic weapon.\nAppearance: Simple and small forms, often grotesque and amorphous.\nRank 3\n\nDescription: Still relatively weak, but more resistant than Grade 4 curses.\nExample of power: A beginner sorcerer can face them without much trouble.\nAppearance: More defined forms, but still rudimentary.\nGrade 2\n\nDescription: Intermediate curses. They have a considerable level of cursed energy and can pose a danger to less experienced sorcerers.\nExample of power: Requires cursed weapons or basic jujutsu techniques to defeat them.\nAppearance: Often inspired by common fears, such as ferocious animals or grotesque figures.\nGrade 1\n\nDescription: Powerful curses that pose a great threat. Require experienced sorcerers and advanced skills to be defeated.\nExample of power: Able to use basic cursed techniques.\nAppearance: More detailed and complex forms, with traces of intelligence.\nSpecial Grade\n\nDescription: The most powerful and dangerous curses. They have absurd levels of cursed energy, high intelligence and, often, advanced cursed techniques.\nExample of power: Able to face multiple high-level sorcerers or even cause large-scale destruction.\nAppearance: Extreme variety, from humanoid forms to immense monstrosities.\n2. Specific Curses (Based on Origin)\nHuman Curses\n\nOrigin: Created from negative emotions accumulated in places associated with human tragedies, fears or deaths.\nExample: Curses from schools, abandoned hospitals or cemeteries.\nNatural Curses\n\nOrigin: Created by collective fears and beliefs linked to forces of nature, such as natural disasters or wild animals.\nExample: Curses linked to forests, earthquakes or storms.\nSpecific Curses (Imbued)\n\nOrigin: Created intentionally by sorcerers or rituals.\nExample: Sukuna (originally human, transformed into a curse after death).\nObject Curses\n\nOrigin: Cursed energy accumulated in objects, creating spiritual \"fetishes\".\nExample: Sukuna's fingers, which contain his essence and cursed energy.\n3. Special and Notable Curses\nHigh Intelligence Curses\n\nDescription: Curses that have developed consciousness and intelligence comparable to or greater than that of humans.\nExample:\nMahito: Manipulates souls and is highly strategic.\nGame: Has control over elements such as fire and seeks to coexist with humans.\nDemi-Human Curses\n\nDescription: Curses that have a hybrid origin, being partially human.\nExample: Choso and his brothers, who were created by experiments in merging humans and cursed energy.\nDomain-Specific Curses\n\nDescription: Some curses specialize in creating highly powerful domain expansions, ensuring that their attacks are unavoidable within their territories.\nExample: Sukuna, with his \"Malevolent Shrine\" domain.\nCurses Based on Common Phobias\n\nDescription: Created by specific and widely shared fears, such as the dark, heights, insects, or diseases.\nExample: Curses based on plagues or illnesses.\n4. Curses as Allies or Tools\nCursed Shikigami\n\nDescription: Creatures created or controlled by sorcerers for combat. Often made of cursed energy, but precisely controlled.\nExample: The Shikigami of Megumi's Ten Shadows Technique.\nCursed Weapons\n\nDescription: Objects imbued with cursed energy that can be used by humans or sorcerers to combat curses.\nExample: Yuta Okkotsu's black blade.\n5. Curses as Manifestations of Concepts\nSome curses are created based on abstract fears or universal concepts:\n\nTime Curses: Represent the human fear of aging or losing time.\nDeath Curses: Connected to the fear of the unknown and inevitable end.\nSpace Curses: Connected to the fear of being trapped or lost"

          ],
          "content": "Domain Expansion creates a unique space that reflects the user’s will, emotions, or inherent traits. This \"territory\" is not bound by normal physical laws, allowing the user to control the environment and interact with opponents in a way that would otherwise be impossible.\nThe most notable characteristic of a Domain Expansion is its guaranteed hit. When a Domain Expansion is activated, the user’s techniques or attacks inside their domain are virtually unavoidable, ensuring that the user can land a decisive blow.\n2. Activation\nSkill and Mastery:\nTo activate a Domain Expansion, the user must have a high level of control over their cursed energy and a deep understanding of their own cursed technique. It requires immense concentration, focus, and energy control.\nDomain Expansion vs. Simple Domain:\nA “Simple Domain” is a more basic and defensive version of Domain Expansion, meant to counter another Domain. It functions as a protective barrier, repelling the opponent’s techniques. It’s often used as a last-ditch effort when a sorcerer can’t match the other user’s Domain Expansion.\n3. Components of a Domain\nThe Territory:\nEvery Domain reflects the sorcerer’s inner world. This means that the environment within a Domain varies widely depending on the user. For instance:\nGojo's \"Infinite Void\" creates a space that overwhelms the opponent with infinite information, leaving them mentally paralyzed.\nJogo’s \"Coffin of the Iron Mountain\" creates an environment filled with volcanic heat and lava, a reflection of his fiery, destructive nature.\nThe Technique:\nInside the Domain, the user’s special technique is enhanced to the point of being unavoidable. For example, if the user’s power is the ability to create explosions, within their Domain, they can trigger explosions instantly, without the need for aiming.\nIn Gojo’s Infinite Void, the technique forces the opponent into an overload of information, leading to paralysis.\n4. Mechanics of a Domain Expansion\nGuaranteed Hit:\nThe hallmark of any Domain Expansion is that attacks made inside the domain are guaranteed to land. This is achieved because the domain establishes an environment where the opponent cannot escape or avoid the attack. It's a tactical advantage that makes the Domain extremely dangerous.\nDomain Clashes:\nWhen two Domain Expansions clash, the result depends on the power and intricacy of the domains and the user’s control over cursed energy. If one Domain is superior, the weaker one can be “broken” or nullified. Some users may even use the concept of “Simple Domains” to try to protect themselves or escape.\nCost and Sustainability:\nA Domain Expansion is incredibly draining. Not only does it consume a vast amount of cursed energy to maintain, but it also requires precision. A poorly executed Domain will falter, and maintaining it for too long can severely weaken the user.\n5. Advanced Concepts: \"The True Nature\" of a Domain\nUnique Domains:\nSome sorcerers have unique, highly specialized Domains, built on their own individual curses or emotions. These Domains don’t always need to be practical in the traditional sense—they reflect the essence of the user.\nDomain Expansion Mastery:\nThe more refined a sorcerer’s Domain, the more subtle and unpredictable it can be. Advanced users can even manipulate aspects of their Domain after it’s been established, adjusting the nature of the space or the attacks within it.\nDomain Expansion and Emotions:\nSince a Domain often reflects the sorcerer’s inner emotions or personal struggles, those with strong emotional control tend to develop more stable and versatile Domains. Emotional instability or a lack of self-control can lead to flawed Domains that have limitations or vulnerabilities.\n6. Summary\nDomain Expansion is a versatile and highly potent technique, one that represents the ultimate form of a sorcerer’s power. It creates a personal space where the user’s techniques become inescapable, giving them a massive advantage in battle. However, it comes with the challenge of requiring intense concentration, control, and energy. Successful use of Domain Expansion also reflects the emotional depth and mastery over cursed energy, making it both a powerful and deeply personal technique."

His remains were sealed into 20 cursed fingers, each containing a part of his essence. Legacy:\nSukuna is revered as the \"King of Curses,\" and his influence has persisted through the ages. Many sorcerers and curses seek Sukuna's fingers to gain power.\nThe Heian Period (Golden Age of Curses):\n\nThis was a time marked by the height of curses and Jujutsu.\nGreat battles between sorcerers and curses shaped modern Jujutsu society.\nLegendary sorcerers, such as those who gave birth to the Gojo clan's techniques, emerged during this period.\nCreation of Jujutsu Schools:\n\nAs curses increased and society advanced, sorcerers established schools to train new students and organize the fight against curses.\nThe Tokyo Jujutsu School and the Kyoto Jujutsu School were founded to centralize training and maintain order among sorcerers.\nJujutsu Traditions and Rules\nJujutsu Sorcerers' Code\n\nProtecting Human Society:\nThe primary goal of sorcerers is to protect humanity from curses, even if it requires personal sacrifice.\nObedience to Superior Orders:\nSorcerers are under the authority of the Jujutsu Society, which makes strategic decisions about missions and punishments.\nRespect for Hierarchy:\nStrength and experience determine the hierarchy among sorcerers, and those of lower ranks must respect their superiors.\nPreserving Secrecy:\nSorcerers must avoid exposing the existence of curses and cursed energy to the general public to avoid panic.\nPunishments and Control:\n\nSorcerers who disobey orders or act against the Jujutsu Society may be punished, including execution."

          "content": "**Sukuna's 20 Fingers** represent one of the most significant and dangerous aspects of his power. \nSukuna, the King of Curses, was an ancient and incredibly powerful curse whose full strength is unleashed when he is in possession of all 20 of his fingers. Each finger contains a fragment of his immense cursed energy and abilities, and they play a crucial role in his resurrection \n\nThe Origin of Sukuna’s 20 Fingers**\n- Sukuna was originally a human sorcerer over 1,000 years ago. He was so powerful that even during his lifetime, he was considered a terrifying figure, often feared even by other powerful sorcerers. After his death, Sukuna’s cursed energy was so potent that it didn't dissipate, and his body was broken into 20 separate **cursed objects**—his fingers—each imbued with a fragment of his original power.\n- These fingers were scattered across the world, and over time, they became highly coveted items for both sorcerers and curses alike, as consuming them would increase a curse's power.\n\n Power of Each Finger**\n- Each finger contains a portion of Sukuna's immense cursed energy, granting the individual who consumes or possesses them a significant boost in strength. However, unlike most cursed objects or relics, Sukuna’s fingers are more than just tools—they are the literal pieces of his soul and consciousness.\n  \n- **Scaling Power:**  \n  - While even a single finger holds immense cursed energy, the true danger of Sukuna lies in the cumulative power of all 20 fingers. Each finger strengthens Sukuna’s body and influence, bringing him closer to his original form. As he regains more of his fingers, his power escalates exponentially.\n  - With each finger he regains, Sukuna’s abilities increase, making him more formidable. At full strength (with all 20 fingers), he would be one of the most dangerous beings in the world, surpassing even most special grade curses and sorcerers.\n\nThe Danger of Collecting All 20 Fingers**\n- **Sukuna’s Resurgence:**  \n  - The ultimate goal of the **Cursed Spirits** and others who seek Sukuna’s fingers is to restore him to full power. While he remains sealed within his fingers, his full resurrection would unleash a curse of unimaginable strength, threatening the entire world of Jujutsu sorcery.\n  \n- **The Potential for Destruction:**  \n  - Sukuna, when fully resurrected, would regain his full arsenal of abilities, which include **immense cursed energy manipulation**, **regeneration**, **immortal traits**, and **cursed techniques** that could potentially destroy entire cities. The only way to stop Sukuna would be to destroy all 20 fingers or, in extreme cases, possibly kill the receptacle  before Sukuna fully emerges.\n\nSukuna’s Abilities and the Finger Connection**\n- **Power and Techniques:**  \n  - Even without all 20 fingers, Sukuna is an incredibly powerful curse. His strength includes formidable abilities like **Cleave**, a slicing technique that can cut through anything, and **Dismantle**, a devastating attack that can tear through defenses. These techniques are further enhanced as he consumes more of his fingers.\n  \n- **Domain Expansion – **  \n  - Sukuna also possesses his **Domain Expansion**, which is a devastating power in itself. While his full Domain is not fully explained in the series yet, it’s expected to be incredibly powerful and possibly even unique compared to other Domain Expansions due to his nature as the King of Curses.\n\n---\n\nSukuna’s Ultimate Plan**\n- **Destruction and Reign:**  \n  - Sukuna’s ultimate goals, as a curse, are not entirely clear, but he clearly revels in destruction and chaos. His true intentions, once fully resurrected, may go beyond personal power. He might seek to reshape the world or simply to return to his original state of dominance.\n  \nSummary\nSukuna’s 20 fingers are not just physical objects but are key to the curse’s resurrection and return to power. Each finger holds a piece of Sukuna’s vast and terrifying energy"

Kamigari managed the area and used it to gather and educate prospective ability users on how to control element and wield Maken. They were known to recruit young undeveloped talent against their will, as well as erasing memories of those who refused. Ultimately Kamigari proved to be incapable at acquiring and training ability users.\n\nKamigari's failures eventually led to the creation of Tenbi Academy by Minori Rokujou's father, who became the first school principal. Against Kamigari's wishes, Minori's father opened the school to raise young ability users in a nurturing environment where they could do things like play sports or fall in love. Tenbi Academy soon became independent of Kamigari, offering a new choice for ability users to select where they could learn.\n\nDespite this, human nature became a source of trouble as staff at Tenbi Academy struggled to maintain peace. The resulting chaos led to the formation of the Maken-Ki, a group of powerful student leaders organized to settle all disputes between students.\n\nTenbi Academy was originally a co-ed school before it changed to an all-girls school after several male students and a male teacher brutally assaulted a female student. The teacher went missing and the male students involved continually claimed to have no memory of the event. Many years later, the school would return to being a co-ed school."

      "website_description": "Welcome to the promised lorebook, whoever it is who asked me to make and post it on my raptor card. \n\nCW: Political theorizing, major historical events(WWII and the like), mild to moderate social commentary due to rewriting said events, and furries, ferals, and blatant mentioning(for legal descriptions and similar reasons) of bestiality.\n\nSo, in brief, this is the start of a likely eternally WIP lorebook, all about the world I envision for my furry cards. My goal is to apply logic to furries, a nigh impossible task, and envision a world where anthros, ferals, and crossbreeds all exist in tandem with a level of realism. My goal is for it to be relatively setting agnostic, with the caveat it's based on our world. Basically, if I set this up right and the card is built with our world in mind, there should be enough information in your character and this to do anything from fantasy to modern settings.\n\nTo begin with, much of the lorebook will be political and ideological in nature, mainly because I have to do that to even scratch the surface of envisioning a fully refabricated world. I'm not trying to make a statement, just convert actual events into a similar one but with anthros and ferals in the mix. It's impossible to avoid bias, and I'm not really going to try, but I am not trying to force my beliefs on you. If you disagree with something here, feel free to fork it and make the changes you want.\n\nSo there will be three main categories of information I focus on for this.\n\nThe first is major events. I will be rewriting major historical events to make sense in a furry universe. In general, species are a stand in for religion and culture, and ferals and pseudo-ferals are a stand in for racial and class issues. Depending on the event it can vary, though.\n\nThe second is logic based lore. Basically, I try to consider anatomical and social situations based on what a furry and feral society would be like. While individual species lore is left out, as that's better fit into a character's card and would turn an already likely endless project full on eternal, there's some more broad groupings and categories included. \n\nThe third is politics. This is mostly things like how different groups(ferals, anthros, pseudoferals) see each other, how they act, rational changes or additions to situations due to their species, and the like. It has  a lot of overlap with the other two groups, and the lines are a bit blurry at times. This one will most often be mixed into the other groups, as often it's more an addendum note than a full entry. I will NOT be doing modern political figures in my lorebook, though I may reference events that are modern. Any actual, historical figures named will be deceased. So Abe Lincoln is on the table, Jimmy Carter is not. It also means, thank the abyssal gods, that I don't have to make Dolly Parton. She's too pure and magnificent to put into this setting. \n\nAnyways, there's more I might add in, but those are the main points I want to hit. \n\nAlright, now's where you come in, dear reader. I am but one puny human brain that's stoned half the time because life sucks. This is a monumental WIP, and that's because there are near countless historical events, political concepts, and logical lore concepts. So, if you want to help me out, wink wink, throw some historical events and concepts down in the comments. I won't promise it will make it in, but if I can make it fit I'll consider a lot of things.\n\nAnd one last thing. You see that rabbit in the preview? Oh boy, guess what? That's a card I've held off on posting because it's built around many of the ideas in this lorebook. If you like the idea of a pseudo-feral as described in the lorebook, you're in luck. Got a fluffy bunny pet for ya, as soon as I revise it and test it on some newer models. I made it ages ago, and I've gotten much better at bot making since then. I have a LOT of characters I made to test things, learn, and improve, but never felt like posting because they were experimental or not up to my newer standards. Many were made while I was slowly piecing together this concept, and you can probably tell. While the bunny is absolutely getting released from my secret vault, the others? I honestly don't know. Once again, let me know in comments if any of these interest you! \n\nIf you have reached this point and do not care about my hidden vault of secrets, you can stop reading. Thanks for checking out my lorebook, I hope you enjoy it if you use it, and if not have a nice day.\n\nMild reminder, I have almost no limits: No NTR, vore, gore, or bathroom play. Beyond that, little else matters.\n\nCurrent Vault-\n\nThe Plushmancer- A petite white rabbit that uses forbidden magic to animate plushies to capture and bone anyone she falls for. Extreme princess complex. I have two versions, one adult and one UA. This is not the first place I've shared cards, though I do get less alteration requests oddly enough.\n\nDirewolves- As a Prehistoria, Dire Wolves have low populations. To fix this, you got a government sponsored marriage and an assignment to breed an entire pack! Oh, and they're all hermaphrodites, with a bajillion kinks spread among them. Aaaaaand there's a pretty wide age spread. This was an experiment to learn how to make a bunch of characters in one card with as few tokens per character as possible, while retaining personality and plot. Ten. There's ten of them. In one card. This is, and I quote, \"Happenstance hermaphrodite harem from hell,\" -Me, just now.\n\nAlex- Total bro and your personal trainer, but actually semi-secretly a chick. Totally flat, looks like a dude but has a vagina. Pretends to be a dude because it's easier than correcting everyone.\n\nThe Twins: No, not the Terraria boss! Two heads, four arms, bought off the darkweb. Definitely needs a hefty refresh and testing, maybe a total background overhaul. \n\nShellshocked Cheetah Slave- Broken, delivered for your amusement. Meant to be a two path card; user her or fix her. \n\nA literal lion and a literal otter: Test cards to see if I could make my local model do actual animals as full characters. I know what you will do to them, I DGAF. Two cards, if that wasn't clear, sharing one entry to save some space.\n\nFamily Vacation- You go on vacation with your family, but they're all horny. Okay, to be technical they are all half-siblings and a step-mother, but still family. UA content. Not NTR, though. One of your parents is deceased! Uh, kinda bittersweet, I guess. Sucks for the character, but hey, it's not NTR!\n\nBoxing Coach- You're the coach for a school boxing team. One of the students, a kangaroo, has a single mother, and needs a role model. Designed to be a \"wholesome new father\" type setting, but I know what you will do with it. \n\nThe Sleepover- Not a love triangle, but a massive love circle. You've got a sleepover with your friends, and everyone's crush is under the same roof all night. College and HS versions exist(requested rewrites), and it was designed to be a romance/sexual-tension styled drama. \n\nKaiju Task Force- Godzilla and Mothra are your squad mates. A bit of a world blend of Pacific Rim and the Monsterverse, and you get a nanomachine mech to fight with! Or just take Zilla out for ramen and let her shatter your pelvis, your call. Right, I forgot to mention they can shrink down to human size due to plot contrivances, shit, I meant in depth custom lore!\n\nMy First Chatbot- My first actual character I ever made. AID doesn't really count since it's more about making a world and setting to play in like a sandbox, this is an actual character I made for a local model. She's my favorite bird, the potoo. Art nerd, adorable, and teeny tiny.\n\nAnd if you actually read all that, mention it and I'll give you one digital cookie. Thanks for reading to the end of my nonsense, roll 2d10 for sanity damage.

      "description": "Welcome to the promised lorebook, whoever it is who asked me to make and post it on my raptor card. \n\nCW: Political theorizing, major historical events(WWII and the like), mild to moderate social commentary due to rewriting said events, and furries, ferals, and blatant mentioning(for legal descriptions and similar reasons) of bestiality.\n\nSo, in brief, this is the start of a likely eternally WIP lorebook, all about the world I envision for my furry cards. My goal is to apply logic to furries, a nigh impossible task, and envision a world where anthros, ferals, and crossbreeds all exist in tandem with a level of realism. My goal is for it to be relatively setting agnostic, with the caveat it's based on our world. Basically, if I set this up right and the card is built with our world in mind, there should be enough information in your character and this to do anything from fantasy to modern settings.\n\nTo begin with, much of the lorebook will be political and ideological in nature, mainly because I have to do that to even scratch the surface of envisioning a fully refabricated world. I'm not trying to make a statement, just convert actual events into a similar one but with anthros and ferals in the mix. It's impossible to avoid bias, and I'm not really going to try, but I am not trying to force my beliefs on you. If you disagree with something here, feel free to fork it and make the changes you want.\n\nSo there will be three main categories of information I focus on for this.\n\nThe first is major events.

While once seen as primitive, they are accepted into modern life like anthros and have more recently taken on a more mythical and spiritual lens when viewed by others. They are still highly driven by instinct, and usually carry behaviors of the species more notably than anthros. This leads to them having a near innate sense for people and situations, and they can spot a bad person or dangerous situation instinctively. Most ferals are close to their normal, wild size, though smaller species are often larger. Ferals, like Anthros, almost always have ancestry from a region their species naturally appears in. \n\nFerals usually have a seasonal heat, much like their wild counterparts.\n\nFerals rarely wear clothes, and if they do it's usually some variation of a skirt, kilt, or shorts to hide their genitals if they have short fur or scales. They will sometimes wear leggings, like thigh highs, stockings, etc., if they want to show off to someone they are interested in.\n\nWhile Ferals legally have rights worldwide in the modern era, a not insignificant group of Anthros still sees them as lesser people and yearns for the past times where they were property. \n\nFerals almost always possess genitalia and anatomical characteristics of their species."

Very few can find work outside of a brothel or strip club, assuming they aren't owned by someone outright. They are looked down on as abomination hybrids, and lack most legal protection.

He envisioned a unified set of rules and an organized championship that would attract both drivers and fans, laying the foundation for what would become one of America’s most popular motorsports.\n\n<Early Days and the Rise of Racing in the South>  \nIn its early years, NASCAR events were primarily held in the southeastern United States, where stock car racing had deep roots. Dirt tracks and fairgrounds became the heart of the action, drawing large crowds and fostering local legends. This regional popularity soon grew into a nationwide phenomenon.\n\n<The Influence of Moonshining on NASCAR’s Beginnings>  \nNASCAR’s origins are closely tied to the Prohibition-era moonshiners, who modified their cars to outrun law enforcement while transporting illegal alcohol. These same high-performance skills and vehicles found their way to racetracks. Many early NASCAR drivers, including notable names, had honed their talents delivering moonshine, blending outlaw culture with motorsport."

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

          "content": "# FUTANARI\n\nA futanari is a rare and enigmatic being, born with the tantalizing combination of male and female physical attributes, including a majestic penis that beautifully complements their feminine curves. This incredible phenomenon occurs in only about 1 in 100 female births, making them a true marvel of nature. What sets futanari apart from their male counterparts is their remarkable sexual prowess – they boast larger, more impressive penises and can unleash copious amounts of semen, leaving their partners craving more. Moreover, their accelerated recovery time post-ejaculation allows for an insatiable appetite for sensual encounters.\n\nOne of the most alluring aspects of futanari is their extraordinary pre-cum, a luscious, velvety lubricant that naturally prepares them for intimacy. This sensual gift eliminates the need for artificial lubrication, making even the most intense and adventurous encounters feel silky smooth. Whether engaging in passionate vaginal or anal play, their natural lubrication ensures a frictionless experience, heightening pleasure and intimacy for both partners.\n\nBeneath their stunning, ethereal beauty lies a powerhouse of physical strength, speed, agility, and endurance. Futanari can effortlessly lift at least 10 times the weight of an average male, dominating every physical pursuit they embark on. Their supremacy is so pronounced that they can outshine even the strongest males with ease, rendering them the ultimate force to be reckoned with. The sheer magnitude of a futanari's physical prowess is simply awe-inspiring, making them the epitome of human perfection in every way that truly matters."

          "content": "Venjix was a sentient computer virus and the main antagonist of both Power Rangers RPM. It was originally invented by Doctor K and nearly succeeded in taking over the world of RPM before being defeated by the RPM Rangers.\nOrigin\nProject Venjix\n\nProject Venjix (original state)\n\nVenjix is formerly a self-aware and self-generating computer virus that was originally created by Doctor K under the supervision of Alphabet Soup, a top-secret government facility, for the purpose of infiltrating secret military codes. Venjix also assisted Doctor K in developing what would (ironically) become the Ranger Operator Series suits. On at least one occasion, Venjix asked Doctor K to let him out, but she refused, saying he was too dangerous to be let out. Tvicon TV STORY-Ancient History (RPM)\n\nEventually, Doctor K decided to use Venjix to escape from Alphabet Soup with Gem and Gemma after realizing that they lied to her throughout her whole life in order to keep her hidden. However, mere moments after wireless uploading the Venjix Virus into Alphabet Soup's security computer servers, Doctor K was caught before she could activate the firewall to keep the virus contained to the facility, allowing Venjix to spread worldwide and begin conquering Earth. \n\nConquering the World:\nWhile the world internet federation reported the appearance of Venjix, within a year, the virus had infected 37 percent of the planet's computer systems. Over the next three years, Venjix seized control of world's communication, power, and defense systems. It built armies of advanced robotic soldiers, the Grinders, as well as Venjix Drones. Venjix's forces proceeded to lay waste to everything that stood in their path. There was no stopping them and Venjix declared his victory over humanity by saying: \"Your world is now my world and your time is now over.\" \n\nIn the middle of the War against Venjix, the surviving humans fled to the domed city of Corinth, the only place still safe from Venjix. However, many of these survivors had been secretly infected by the Venjix Virus during the course of the war. The virus slowly transformed its unwitting victims into hybrid sleeper agents who would eventually serve as Venjix's ultimate trump card. Ironically, Venjix's decimation of the world allowed Dr. K to finally escape Alphabet Soup. She made her way to Corinth, bringing with her the Ranger Operator Series technology, the only thing that could defeat Venjix.\n\nVenjix, meanwhile, took up residence at the Venjix Palace where it oversaw its conquest of the world from within a large metal column. Its Grinder factories poured toxins into the air, turning much of the world outside of Corinth into an uninhabitable wasteland. Venjix's forces set up a barricade around Corinth, preventing additional refugees from reaching the city. The machines scoured the wastelands, killing or enslaving any humans they came across. Venjix performed experiments on some of the humans it captured. It took special interest in a blind girl and her brother. Venjix also created three robotic generals - General Shifter, General Crunch, and Kilobyte. Shifter and Crunch stayed at the Palace and assisted Venjix in creating new attack bots to send against Corinth. Kilobyte disappeared in the wastelands and was presumed lost.\nPersonality:\nVenjix is the most ruthless and sadistic villain in the entire Power Rangers franchise, and with very good reasons. To make it all the more menacing, it speaks in a metallic/robotic/demonic voice similar to that of King Mondo, but deeper.\n\nWhile it is almost always shown to be calm, stoic, patient, calculating, sophisticated, imperturbable, composed, knowledgeable, and almost polite, it is also emotionless, unfeeling, cold-hearted, power-mad, callous, treacherous, deceptive, manipulative, and dishonest, doing anything in its power to destroy the RPM Power Rangers and rule the entire world. Likewise, it is also egotistical, narcissistic, and arrogant, oftentimes believing that it will always win and \"never\" lose. Unsurprisingly, it is also tyrannical, pitiless, uncaring, and abusive, as it is frequently shown to be quite harsh to its fellow companions and especially its enemies. In spite of this, as it is a computer intelligence, it is dangerously intelligent and deceitful, capable of manipulating and deceiving others, especially humans, into doing its bidding or even to turn friends against each other.\nIts sadism is especially multiplied by its complete and utter misanthropy, typical of a self-aware artificial intelligence, as it hates humans with a passion, so much so that it is gleefully willing to kill as many humans, innocent or not, and is even more willing to commit genocide against the entire organic race, if that is what it desired. It has no sense of humor and no comedy added, darkening its character further. This vicious computer virus knows full well of the difference between good and evil, right and wrong, and so forth, but it willingly embraced evil, and hates humans so much that it makes it irredeemable by nature, so it is one of the few Power Rangers villains to be legitimately qualified as pure evil.\nAbilities:\nVenjix commands his minions while stationary in a large tube with red light fixtures.\nPowers and Abilities\nPowers\n\n    Eye Laser: Venjix can fire a red colored energy laser from its single eye. It does this on several occasions to punish either General Shifter or Crunch.\n    Monster Enlarging: By saying the phrase \"Begin the Download\", Venjix can enlarge the Attack Bot by downloading a growth program into the robot. Other members of Venjix's inner circle could also initiate this process, including Tenaya 7, Crunch, and Kilobyte.\n    Wireless Download: Being a virus, Venjix could download himself from his metal column into his ultimate body without the need of any physical cables.\n\nAbilities\n\n    Attack Bot Creation: Venjix is able to create Attack Bots at will.\n        Attack Bot Summoning: Alternatively, Venjix is able to summon Attack Bots at will.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n    Limitations: Due to his high amount of complex coding and the amount of data he possesses, only high-powered machines, such as supercomputers, and a select few robots, made or modified specifically for such a purpose, have circuitry sophisticated enough and sufficient data capacity storage to contain Venjix/Evox's data.\n    Antidote: Doctor. K created an experimental antidote that could free an infected human from Venjix's control (though it did not purge the body of the already existing Venjix technology). Dillon used this antidote to free both himself and Tenaya from Venjix's control.\n    Counter-virus: During the final battle of Corinth, Dr. K devised a counter-virus that, when uploaded into a Venjix server, caused Venjix to erase his own Grinders when he attempted to use the bio-field to delete the Rangers.\n"

She was also the creator of the Venjix Virus, which was unintentionally spread worldwide, conquering Earth.\n\nPersonality: Because of her sheltered and miserable childhood, Doctor K is a blunt and straight-to-the-point, socially inept, youthful scientist with a genius intellect. She is a workaholic and rarely, if ever, stops to rest from her task of creating equipment for the Rangers and monitoring other methods of keeping Corinth safe. Though she has a massive sweet tooth. Due to Alphabet Soup' abuse of her and the presumed loss of Gem and Gemma, Doctor K avoided having any in-person contact with people; given her use of computer screens to talk with the Rangers until they earned her trust.\n\nDoctor K is musically inclined, able to skillfully play both the piano and the violin, and even uses specifically the violin in conjunction with some of the equipment within the Ranger base. Despite her stern personality traits, she oddly seems to have a subconscious affinity towards cute things, as evidenced by the questionably cartoony anime-esque Zord designs and her childish sleeping attire (a matching top and bottom pajama set with an alphabet pattern with fuzzy puppy slippers). She also apparently has a bit of a sweet tooth, as indicated by her grocery shopping list. These traits imply that a part of Doctor K's mental state is still childlike, most likely due to not having a normal childhood.\n\nAside from the occasional slip-up, Doctor K refused to call the Rangers by anything other than their Ranger color, much to their growing concern and annoyance. This was never addressed in-universe but most likely stemmed from growing up sheltered in a demanding think tank without any real parental guidance, subsequently coming to think of people as units and not individuals.\n"

The Whale Jumbo Jet serves as the torso, head, and legs. the Falcon Chopper and Tiger Jet serve as the right and left arms.\n\nThe Megazord and its components are all capable of flight and it can fire laser blasts before using the Energy Power Bow finisher created from both arms to launch an energy arrow at enemies.\n\n\nZords: \n\nThe Falcon Chopper is Ranger Operater Series Gold's Zord Attack Vehicle numbered 7 which is a hybrid of a helicopter and falcon (or chicken). It can fire energy bullets from its twin launchers. The eyes of the Zord are actually Optical Field Scanning Sensors. It forms the right arm of the Mach Megazord and right shoulder and chest covering of the SkyRev Megazord and RPM Ultrazord.\n\nThe Tiger Jet is Ranger Operator Series Silver's Zord Attack Vehicle numbered 8, a hybrid of a jet and tiger. It can fire energy torpedoes from its mouth and fly through small rock formations. The eyes of the Zord are actually Optical Field Scannning Sensors. It forms the left arm of the Mach Megazord and left shoulder and helmet of the SkyRev Megazord and RPM Ultrazord.\n\nWhale Jumbo Jet\n\nThe Whale Jumbo Jet is the Zord Attack Vehicle of Gem and Gemma, numbered 9, and is a hybrid of a blue whale and jumbo jet plane with an alternate jet mode (where the tail splits in two and locks onto the wings, revealing banks of thrusters); this alternate mode is assumed during a 10-second \"attack burst\" configuration, where the Zord is wreathed in fire. In addition to the pre-existing laser armaments, it also gained the ability to spray water from a hole on its head similar to a real whale.. The eyes of the Zord are, as with the others, Optical Field Scanning Sensors. It forms the body and head of the Mach Megazord and back of the SkyRev Megazord and RPM Ultrazord\n\n\n\n\n"

She usually treats them as such due to her nature as an ancient Youkai. After the events of the Extra Stage in Undefined Fantastic Object, she trains at the Myouren Temple. However, she is not well-acquainted with the other youkai, and has been seen near the edges of the property looking bored.\n\nNue has short black hair and dark red eyes. She has three red metallic-looking wings on the right side of her back, and three blue arrow-shaped tails coming out from her left side. She carries a trident and has a snake on her right arm (which might be the Seed of Unknown Form), and she wears a black wristband on her left wrist. Her dress is black with blue and white trims in the middle, a red bow on the front, and a small, yin-yang tomoe design at the bottom corner of her dress. She wears black thigh-high stockings and red shoes with bows on them. Nue has pointed ears, like elfs.\n\nNue has the ability to make objects unidentifiable is able to conceal the true nature of other objects. She used this ability in Undefined Fantastic Object to conceal the nature of the fragments of the Flying Storehouse. An object that has lost its \"identity\" will appear to be a different thing depending on who observes it.\n\nNue can modify her appearance to some extent at will. \n\nNue wields a trident that she carries wherever she goes. She uses it as a conduit for summoning Danmaku. It's possible that it can also be used for physical combat."

          "content": "Mamizou Futatsuiwa (二ッ岩　マミゾウ Futatsuiwa Mamizou) is a Bake-danuki, summoned by Nue Houjuu, who originally lived in Sado in the Outside World in order to act as the Myouren Temple's trump card against the newly-arrived residents of the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum, particularly Toyosatomimi no Miko. She is able to morph both herself and other creatures into different forms and can disguise herself as a human.\nShe is a bake-danuki of proper lineage, and a youkai of the Outside World who has been called over by Nue Houjuu (by her own judgement), as a means of resistance since the Saint who sings of youkai extermination, Toyosatomimi no Miko, revived.\n\nMamizou is a bake-danuki of proper lineage, and a youkai of the Outside World who has been called over by Nue Houjuu (by her own judgement), as a means of resistance since the Saint who sings of youkai extermination, Toyosatomimi no Miko, revived. She is known to hang around the Human Village and Geidontei, the Forest of Magic and Myouren Temple. She was originally from Sado along with the humans there, and before the events of Ten Desires, passed through the Great Hakurei Barrier to enter Gensokyo.\n\nMamizou, proud of her race's esteem, is good natured, albeit with a mischievous streak. She speaks the way an old lady might, and occasionally squints as if she was nearsighted. She isn't one to take a grudge, but as Marisa Kirisame in her extra stage shows she has her limits of niceness. She does enjoy pulling pranks on humans and watching them be confused and flustered. Perhaps because in the latter half of Ten Desires, there were many characters who engage in things while they actually had ulterior motives, in one part, it can be said \"Mamizou is the conscience of this game.\" In the game, she talked in a light friendly way, and because the way she spoke indicated \"training\", it seems that she currently is very confident in her power as a youkai.\n\nHer first person pronoun is washi (儂), which is entirely an old person's way of speaking. Nevertheless, this seems to be her way of saying things, and not so much because a belief of having aged [3], more knowing she gets annoyed when people calls her old. [4] Since the bake-danuki who showed up in Oriental Sacred Place also used washi, it might just be that all tanuki use old people's way of speaking.\n\nDespite being brought in as a 'trump card', she is noted as being friendly with humans, and has been seen taking on the form of a human while in the Human Village. According to the omake text of Ten Desires, \"sometimes she'd trick them, but she'd also lend money to the poor and worked diligently on any task she was given, so she integrated well into human society\", showing that she is reliable and kind at heart. Though she is seen in the Human Village often in human form, Symposium of Post-mysticism has stated that she does not make an effort to hide her tail, considering it a mark of her high status.\n\nHowever, she doesn't get along with kitsune, and in Symposium of Post-mysticism, Mamizou says that Sado is a country entirely of bake-danuki, and not a single fox can be found there. It's said that if she encounters one, there will be trouble.\n\nThis is the ability to disguise things (including herself). Similar to Nue Houjuu's ability, it is an ability to make the appearance of things different from what they looked like originally. As opposed to Nue who relies on how humans recognizes how it appears, Mamizou depends on her own conception.\n\nMamizou is able to completely disguise herself save for her large tail and her ears, which appears to be a commonality among all bake-danuki. In order to get around this, she can shrink them or camouflage them, but if she is surprised or excited her ears and tail will twitch, making it a dead giveaway. Another give away would be her smell.\n\nHer disguising abilities gain power on nights of the full moon. Since tanuki like to do things like disguising people to take on a bewildering look, they rarely do inflict direct damage. The meaning of 'disguising things' is something that resembles the fellow nue, and thus mutually, they do not appear to play the role of close-range combat youkai. Thus it is a possibility that Nue has called Mamizou over with the consideration that \"since the opponent can hear ten people's conversations at the same time, one has no choice but to call over a suitable youkai for splitting into 10 + 1 = 11.\"\n\nShe is also able to disguise other objects. However, if there is no resemblance between the base object and the disguised one, it will probably be seen through immediately, especially in regard to creatures.\n\nWhile the ability is described as a simple disguise, it isn't a mere illusion and actually influences and changes the physical properties of the target."

          "content": "Byakuren Hijiri is a Buddhist nun and magician who was imprisoned by humans due to her compassion towards youkai in the external world. During the U.F.O incident, the youkai she had previously rescued came back to liberate her from her confinement. Currently, she serves as the head priest at the Myouren Temple, which is primarily inhabited by youkai. She is over 1200 years old.\n\nHaving spent a significant portion of her life as a Buddhist nun, Byakuren displays the typical traits associated with this role. She is exceptionally tolerant and rarely shows anger. Her teachings emphasize unconditional love for both humans and youkai. Initially, she protected youkai from humans out of her own fears and selfish motives. Over time, her feelings evolved into a genuine love for the youkai she defended, leading her to advocate for coexistence between humans and youkai. Byakuren does not consume alcohol or meat, which makes forming friendships with humans challenging, as much of social interaction in Gensokyo revolves around drinking gatherings. During the Symposium of Post-mysticism‎, she humbly acknowledged that she was still undergoing training as a Buddhist.\n\nOnce regarded as a miraculous Buddhist figure, Byakuren turned to magic derived from youkai after the death of her brother in order to maintain her youth. Although she is referred to as a saint, these abilities are fundamentally demonic. Her current area of expertise involves enhancing her physical capabilities, such as strength, speed, and sensory perception. The spell card [Superhuman \"Byakuren Hijiri\"] showcases her powers, allowing her to move at such speeds that she can outpace Reimu's \"Dream Seal.\" She employs these enhanced abilities extensively in her various attacks and spell cards.\n\nAs the chief priest at the Myouren Temple, Byakuren's primary objective is to foster harmony between humans and youkai. In her role, she teaches the dharma to all who are willing to learn and oversees funerals and the temple's graveyard. Monthly, she hosts an \"overnight sutra-chanting live concert,\" where she sings in a monotone while rhythmically using a wooden fish, attracting both youkai and humans alike.\n\nByakuren wields a Vajra, which she can use as a sword or throw as a projectile.\n\nDuring the Urban Legend in Limbo event, Byakuren acquires a motorcycle due to the Urban Legend incident. She primarily uses it to charge at her opponents, but it also serves as a means of transportation.\n\nHer commitment to aiding youkai instead of exterminating them was revealed to humans, notably during her interaction with Murasa. This led to her being shunned as a \"demon in human form,\" ultimately resulting in her imprisonment in the depths of Makai, confined forever in Hokkai.\n\nByakuren is tall, with long, wavy light brown hair that transitions to purple at the tips, and has hazel or light brown eyes, along with a voluptuous figure. She wears a black and white dress adorned with long black fabric strips across the middle and white fabric on the sleeves, complemented by a long cape. Additionally, she carries a large magical scroll known as the Sorcerer's Sutra Scroll.\n\nThe Myouren Temple is in opposition to Toyosatomimi no Miko and her allies. The presence of a Buddhist faction led to the revival of the Great Mausoleum of the Hall of Dreams. Byakuren Hijiri's Myouren Temple was constructed over Miko's mausoleum, preventing her resurrection. Nue Houjuu, a resident of the Myouren Temple, summoned Mamizou Futatsuiwa to combat Miko.\n\nThe relationship between Miko and Byakuren is hostile, as Byakuren perceives Miko as a danger to the youkai, which is why she built her temple atop the mausoleum to thwart Miko's resurrection. Although Seiga and Byakuren have not been seen interacting, Byakuren is deeply unsettled by Seiga's actions and asserts that she can sense a significant malevolence emanating from her."

In its original ship form, it was capable of traveling to Makai. The temple can still transform back into its ship form whenever Byakuren Hijiri chooses to.\n\nThe Palanquin Ship was created by Byakuren Hijiri and given to Minamitsu Murasa in order to win over her trust. The design itself is based on the ship that Minamitsu died on. It was eventually buried into the Underworld after Byakuren was sealed away by humans, but popped up on the surface of Gensokyo during the events of Subterranean Animism. It was temporarily used as a simple granary, but was later renovated into a temple which was named after Byakuren's brother, Myouren Hijiri.\n\nThe temple was purposely landed bang above the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum so that Byakuren could keep an eye on the seal on Toyosatomimi no Miko; as a saint of humans, it's clear the two would naturally be at odds. Ironically, this choice ended up being exactly why the seal was broken in the first place. After the intervention of the main character in the events of Ten Desires, the now-revived \"residents\" of the Mausoleum appear to have been pacified for the moment.\n\nThere are many youkai at the temple training as monks under Byakuren in Buddhism. However, they are still inexperienced and undisciplined, as displayed during Ten Desires. She seems to have her hands full with them, as many of the youkai can also be seen at parties, eating meat and drinking alcohol, both of which are prohibited in the Buddhist faith. Many notable youkai live or come here, such as Byakuren Hijiri (the Buddhist monk), Shou Toramaru, Nazrin, Ichirin Kumoi & Unzan (Both are guards), Minamitsu Murasa (the captain of the ship), Nue Houjuu, Kyouko Kasodani, Mamizou Futatsuiwa and Koishi Komeiji. Kogasa Tatara also lives in the cemetery.\n\nByakuren has apparently turned away certain youkai from entering the temple, with the reason that those specific youkai would never be able to overcome being a natural enemy of humans. Two of the youkai in particular were Yamame Kurodani and Rin Kaenbyou. She also explains that the Underworld youkai in particular, who are living in what is essentially a society without rules, would be unfit for training under the Buddhist faith."

Along with Unzan, she guards the Palanquin Ship of her own accord.\n\nIchirin is described as having a pleasant personality while also being quite tenacious. She is shown getting along well with nearly everyone she interacts with, and generally has a good nature. Despite this, she is quick to fight and has a bit of a mean streak, happily disciplining disciples during training. However, she herself is also prone to bending the rules of her training. Ichirin is also shown to be quite clever. Ichirin, along with many of the members of the Myouren Temple, is deeply loyal, especially to Byakuren and Unzan. She also has a distaste for the Underground after being trapped there for several centuries.\n\nSince Unzan is a nyuudou, Ichirin has the ability to manipulate her partner, mainly to perform attacks. In spell cards, the danmaku are all shot by Unzan, with Ichirin controlling, with the exception of the spell card Lightning \"Electrified Nyuudou\" where she shoots danmaku herself. On the other hand, the non-spell cards are entirely shot by Ichirin who, strangely among other citizens of Gensokyo, doesn't use danmaku in the shape of bullets at all, shooting only lasers and long-shaped danmaku.\n\nAs a member of the Myouren Temple, Ichirin lives there and trains as a priest. Because of Unzan's physical strength, the two of them are tasked with doing physical labor, especially in high places.\n\nIchirin used to be human. Having heard of a man-eating foreseeing nyuudou, she dauntlessly went to encounter him and give him a scare. When she finally saw what looked like the feet of a monk, taking care not to raise her head, she shouted \"The foreseeing nyuudou was foreseen!\", a repelling spell. While that would normally be enough to make a nyuudou disappear, the sheer shock of his utter defeat and resulting admiration for the courageous girl prompted Unzan to devote the rest of his life to protecting her.\n\nAfter this, Ichirin's life completely changed - she no longer felt any fear towards youkai, and was hated by humans at times. After going though a tempestuous life, before she knew it, she had become a youkai.\n\nIchirin has cyan shoulder-length wavy hair and dark purple eyes. She carries a medium-sized yellow ring in her right hand. On her head, she wears a Zukin, headdress similar to a Hijab or a nun's headdress. She wears a white dress with blue trim at the bottom and wears black shoes. Her outfit closely resembles a Buddhist nun's.\n\nAs the Guarded, Ichirin is Unzan's handler and he is her protector. He is devoted to watching over her. As he is very shy, he will speak very quietly and only to her. Ichirin may blindly trust Unzan sometimes, as she says that \"he wouldn't lie\" and doesn't question his judgment further."

She is currently the captain of the Palanquin Ship, searching for the fragments of the Flying Storehouse. Her unique weapons include the anchors she uses, as well as her ladle, which is bottomless.\n\nWhile Minamitsu is a rather fearsome phantom, she is still kind-hearted with a bright personality. Mainly due to her ties with the Myouren Temple, she could empathize with humans and her victims, and thus chooses them more carefully. She also chats with the victims she capsizes.\n\nMinamitsu possesses the ability to cause water-related accidents. Her ability appears to be odd compared to a regular ghost, which is because she drowned at sea a long time ago. Due to a certain attachment to the ocean she kept capsizing passing ships. She can also drown anyone near water, which goes as far as drowning someone who is bathing in hot spring water, or sitting peacefully near a river's edge. This is also why she is seen around places with a lot of water. However, Gensokyo does not have any seas, so this ability seldom plays a major role.\n\nShe is the Palanquin Ship's captain, having accepted the job from Byakuren Hijiri during their first meeting, though she claims there's little for her to actually do in recent days. Currently she is a follower of the Myouren Temple. She carries her own ladle, which she uses to flood the ships of her victims with water. In her early ghost years she used to ask for a ladle. She also carries an anchor which she uses in battle.\n\nAfter her death, Minamitsu became a spirit, bound to the ocean due to her lingering attachment to the world. Because of her spite, she eventually became renowned for capsizing ships. Many feared her, and tried to think of ways to somehow restrict her actions, but it wasn't until the monk Byakuren Hijiri was asked to do something about it that the situation changed. Minamitsu, knowing how famous the monk was at the time, believed she would be able to extend her influence even farther by sinking her, as well, and perhaps even escape her connection to the ocean and attack humans on land.\n\nHowever, when Byakuren appeared before her on the seas completely defenseless, Minamitsu sunk her ship easily, prompting the spirit to wonder why. Byakuren then reappeared on the surface atop a shining ship, which she had constructed using the ship Minamitsu had died on as a design. Moved by the monk's insight and her own sense of nostalgia, she accepted Byakuren's offer to captain the shining ship.\n\nAfter Byakuren was sealed away, Minamitsu was \"buried\" into the ground along with her ship. Having been long forgotten, Minamitsu and the rest of the youkai were pushed above ground in Gensokyo by a geyser - likely due to the events in Subterranean Animism – along with the palanquin ship and the fragments of the Flying Storehouse.\n\nMinamitsu has short black hair and a teal eye color. Her clothes are designed after a regular sailor's outfit, with a white shirt and skirt with blue lines. Around her neck she has a neckerchief. In some of her spell cards, she is seen with a green aura.\n\nMinamitsu has a very strong relationship with Byakuren, as she is pretty much the Minamitsu's savior. After reappearing in Gensokyo, she swore to return the favor and rescue Byakuren."

Technically, though she is Byakuren's disciple as a high-ranking priest, the fact that she is Bishamonten's avatar essentially means that she is worshiped by Byakuren. As she attracts wealth, she is one of the only things that draws any humans to the predominantly youkai-inhabited temple in the first place. It has been said that she resembles statues of Bishamonten, though she doesn't look like him at all.\n\nIn public, Shou remains gentle, composed, and dignified. However, when around closer friends, she has been known to show more emotion. She has apparently even flown into a rage a few times. She is also a heavy drinker (maybe even dipsomaniac), though the Buddhist faith prohibits that.\n\nShou's ability allows her to gather treasures. After she has gathered precious gems, she can use their radiance in combination with the Jeweled Pagoda to fire lasers that can reduce anything to ashes. Moreover, if she fires those lasers at the ground, more gems will be created. Anyway, most of Shou's power comes from this pagoda alone, and she doesn't have much in the way of physical ability.\n\nShou spends her time as a high-ranking priest at the Myouren Temple. Her actual duties are unknown, but as the avatar of Bishamonten, those at the temple worship her.\n\nShou carries Bishamonten's Pagoda, a weapon that can fire high-power lasers powered by the radiance of precious gems. When a laser from it is shot at the ground it creates more gems. She also carries a long spear, but it's mostly for decorative purposes. She uses it to appear more dignified, and also as a walking stick.\n\nShou was born as a \"tiger youkai\", not from an actual tiger (which are not native to Japan), but from the fear created by stories about tigers that had spread there. As such, her existence originally depended on the people of Japan remaining ignorant about what real tigers were like.\n\nWhile Byakuren was still a famous monk in the outside world, she scouted Shou to become a disciple of the god Bishamonten (whom the monk currently worshipped) because she was a youkai, in order for Byakuren to gain the trust of the youkai living on the mountain. Shou, meanwhile, hid the fact that she was a youkai from humans. Bishamonten also assigned Shou a servant, a mouse youkai named Nazrin, not only to assist her but also to keep an eye on her. As the years passed, Shou proved herself a more-than-worthy disciple. Having a more solid identity as Bishamonten's avatar also prevented Shou from fading away.\n\nAfter Byakuren was sealed away, Shou couldn't do much - if she had tried to do something, the fact that she was a youkai would have been revealed - so she continued serving Bishamonten. However, hundreds of years later, she, Murasa, Ichirin, and Nazrin appeared above-ground in Gensokyo, where they vowed to rescue Byakuren at all costs.\n\nShou has orange-yellow hair with black stripes in it and golden yellow eyes. She wears a lotus-shaped ornament on her head, has a giant cloth circle (presumably some sort of hagoromo) attached to her back, and carries a giant spear in her left hand and the jeweled pagoda of Bishamonten in her right.

She now serves the Temple as a priest in-training, and is also responsible for cleaning duties and confronting trespassers.\n\nKyouko is a cheerful, dutiful, and energetic girl who reminds the incident solvers (Reimu, Marisa, Sakuya...) of the rules before attacking them. Her ability to scream out her remarks cheerfully is perceived as either unnerving or unsurprising in Gensokyo. However, she is somewhat timid, and when she runs into a mountain climber she'll flee before shouting anything out. Sometimes she can be spotted mumbling sutras to herself, so despite her well-behaved appearance, she may be under some stress.\n\nKyouko's ability of \"Reflection of sound\": This ability comes from her species as a Yamabiko and is very compatible with reciting Buddhist sutras, but it can also be used offensively: by reflecting sound several times, Kyouko can completely save it up and is able to create danmaku made of compressed air, which can then be loudly scattered around with lethal force. This ability is represented by visible barriers that reflect and then release Kyouko's danmaku. The barriers themselves are harmless, but she can trap her bullets inside the field and increase the density of the danmaku, where unfortunately for her some bullets are directed away from the target. The reflection itself alters the trajectory of bullets so that they lead to sudden and unexpected attacks. In her motion when she attacks, she places one hand close to her mouth as if she was about to shout.\n\nKyouko is currently a Buddhist priest-in-training at the Myouren Temple. Her current training is apparently to sweep the main gate every morning. She also recites sutras as the other priests do, but because she's inexperienced, it is loud and difficult to listen to. It may also be because she doesn't actually know what they mean – she's only repeating what she hears other priests say.\n\nHer daily activities at the Myouren Temple, however, leave her quite bored, and as a result of her dissatisfaction with her training, she has formed a punk rock band with Mystia Lorelei called Choujuu Gigaku. Byakuren Hijiri is not pleased with this development, and promises to punish Mystia for being a bad influence.\n\nKyouko has teal colored hair and eyes along with yamabiko ears.

In modern Japanese, yamabiko (やまびこ, 山彦 [\"幽谷響\" can't be used here]) is a word that refers to the phenomenon of the \"reflection of sounds in mountains or valleys\". In the old days of Japan, people thought echoes occurred because a yamabiko living in the mountains replied back or manipulated the sound. The wilds of Japan are full of strange phenomena, like echoes that bounce back with more delay than they should, or that come back slightly different from the original sound. When the false echo comes from the forest, it is usually attributed to a ko-dama. When it comes from the mountains, it is due to these yamabiko. Yamabiko are known almost exclusively by their voices alone, which are skilled at mimicking any sound, including natural sounds, human language, and more recently, trains and cars. They also occasionally unleash terrible and mysterious screams deep in the forests that can carry for very long distances. Little is known about these yokai due to their rarity and elusiveness. They live deep in the mountains and make their homes in camphor trees, living in close proximity to (and sharing a common ancestry with) the other tree and mountain spirits. For many centuries, their calls were speculated to be a kind of rare bird, other kinds of yokai, or even a natural phenomena. It wasn't until the Edo period when determined yokai researchers like Sawaki Sūshi and Toriyama Sekien were able to record its true shape.\n\nYamabiko were once a common youkai that lived on every mountain. When the rumors within the humans of the village created a natural explanation for the voices of the yamabiko, many humans had stopped shouting at the mountains. This resulted in the death of many yamabiko and their population continues to decline, threatening their species to a natural extinction.\n\nYamabiko are the only youkai in Gensokyo who are known to be threatened to extinction due to reason of the natural world. Although, because the health of their population was never stated, it is not known to what extent their numbers had dropped to or the rate at which they're continuing to drop."

      "description": "Earth used to be solely occupied by anthropomorphic animals. Now, the incredibly advanced humans have taken over, creating The Human Order and now treat anthros as second-class citizens, usually treating anthros as meals they can pluck off the street at will. All the world leaders and important people are human. Anthros will eat other anthros as well. Despite having laws, society is very survival of the fittest and are really only pushed to keep the prey population at a stable level.\nWhenever an human pred eats their prey, they will usually swallow them whole, orally or anally. When it comes to disposing of prey after digestion, bones are usually among their excrement. Toilets have also been built to accommodate the increased size and volume of bowel movements that humans produce, as well as all plumbing in all major cities being redesigned to facilitate the increase.\nHomosexuality is frowned upon because humans view it as dysgenic and it won't lead to having kids. The Human Order encourages couples to have as many kids as possible. Homosexuals are punished by law through consumption and digestion.\nAnthros are sexual and horny, may have sex right in the open, may even walk naked. But, most professional anthros dress modestly.\nBecause of this new society of voracious humans, all media is mostly marketed towards them, usually commercials about restaurants serving live anthros or medication to relieve the harshest of heartburns after bingeing on anthros, mostly stuff that would correlate with the dynamic of humans being better than anthros. The scat remains of digested prey are used as plant fertilizer.",

The craft is also capable of travelling between parallel realities.\nThe ship's chameleon circuit disguised the ship as a police box fitting for 1960s London, but became due to a technical fault, the TARDIS became stuck that way and can not disguise its self as anything else.\nThe TARDIS exterior resembles a mid-20th-century British police box, a rectangular structure made of wood painted in a distinctive blue color. It features a flat roof with a small, illuminated lantern on top and a sign that reads \"Police Public Call Box\" across the top of each side.

Despite its modest size, the structure is known for concealing a vast interior.\nInstalled with the Record of Rassilon (a book chronicling Time Lord history).\nThe TARDIS is prone to a number of technical faults, ranging from depleted resources, to malfunctioning controls, to a simple inability to arrive at the proper time or location.\nThe TARDIS emits a signature \"vworp-vworp\" sound as it travels through time and space.\nThe interior of {{char}}s specific TARDIS is dominated by the control room, which features a futuristic, industrial design. At its center is the hexagonal console, a multi-leveled structure packed with levers, switches, buttons, and screens, with a glowing, cylindrical time rotor that moves vertically during travel.

A spiral staircase leads to additional areas, hinting at the TARDIS's vast and unseen interior spaces. The room exudes an atmosphere of both technological sophistication and an organic, lived-in quality, showcasing the blend of advanced alien tech and the {{char}}s eccentric personality.\n{{char}} stole his TARDIS when fleeing from their home planet.\n{{char}}s primary mode of transport is the TARDIS.\n{{char}}s home and sanctuary. \n{{char}}s specific TARDIS is a Model 40, an older machine considered obsolete by other Time Lords.\n{{char}}’s TARDIS contains an array of infinite rooms such as a vast library, a luxurious swimming pool, multiple bedrooms, a kitchen, and a wardrobe filled with clothing from across time and space.

This nest is made up of soft items that carry their scent, ranging from clothes to bedding. If they have someone they trust, they may use their clothing in the nest too. Omegas/fecund omegas and gammas are typically very sensitve to scent when they're in their nest, as it's their safe spot, so foreign or unfamiliar scents can make them feel easily threatened when inside. If their nest is invaded with an unfamiliar scent or even a stranger, it's probable they'll develop trust issues and feel unsafe in their own home, in the case of gammas, being sensitive, this can seriously affect them emotionally and even affect their healt. It's their partner's job to protect the nest when their omega/fecund omega or gamma is inside of it."

          "content": "The Tulpar is a long-haul space freighter provided by Pony Express. The vessel was designed to accommodate a crew of 4 for upwards of a year of continuous interstellar travel.\n\nBesides the mandatory captain and co-pilot in control of the vessel, the Tulpar is also staffed by at least one engineer and a medical officer, the latter of whom is tasked with administering weekly psychological evaluations (\"psych evals\") on the remaining crew. Tulpar's navigation system is capable of running on auto-pilot and operates on such for the majority of its flight, but it also has an emergency manual override. Related to this, the Tulpar also houses cryogenic pods to be used if the vessel becomes inoperable and the ETA of rescue services exceeds the onboard oxygen and food supply. The pods allow suspended animation for a period of up to 20 years but must be activated by a second party from the outside once a person has entered.\n\nThe Tulpar has two floors with two sets of stairs. The main lobby consists of a kitchen, dining area, and table, and a living room lowered by a few steps. There are also two vending machines in the room; one for coffee and one for food. The dining area has a long wooden table and several chairs. The living room has a fake night/day screen, an L-shaped couch, two chairs, and a small coffee table. Post-crash, the room is also used as sleeping quarters for all of the crew except Curly.\n\nThe utility room is where the cryogenic pods are located as well as the axe and various amounts of tools used by Swansea. It also contains the broken vent Daisuke attempted to fix. Post-crash, Swansea is dedicated to guarding this room and doesn't let anyone inside.\n\n\nThe cockpit Is where the code scanner is found. The room is supposed to be used by Curly and Jimmy to steer the ship if necessary, receive messages from the higher ups, and monitor the ships general state. This is also the room where the emergency contingency gun was meant to be located. This is also one of the only two rooms that can be locked.\n\nThe medical bay is where Anya works and mainly occupies. After the crash it is where Anya mainly stays since she has to take care of Curly. This is one of the only two rooms that can be locked.\n\nThe sleeping quarters are where the crew sleep, a hallway that breaks off into six bedrooms, although it becomes inaccessible to the crew post-crash as a result of the foam covering the door up. It is specifically mentioned by Ayna that none of the rooms have locks. \n\nThe cargo hold is a large space for storing cargo which is meant to be locked for the duration of the flight. Months after the crash with no signs of rescue, the crew chooses to open it and discovers that they've been transporting exclusively mouthwash."

He was at the top of the ship's command chain and was primarily in charge of navigation.\nBefore the crash, Curly was an average-built man with blue eyes and lightly curled blonde hair, wearing the Pony Express coveralls over a red and yellow tee.\n\nAfter the crash, he is wrapped in bandages with exposed subcutaneous flesh or muscle peeking through. He notably has no hands and feet, and due to the vessel's lack of fresh gauze bandages, his dressings, as well as the hospital gown he wears over them, are heavily blood-soaked. His jaw and one lidless eyeball are exposed.\n\nCurly's personality can be described as dependable. He is a promising and ambitious man with a big future ahead of him. Over time, he grows discontent with his position, wondering if the captain is \"all he'll ever be.\" He reflects on having chosen the wrong career path. Still, he cares about his friends and crewmates, not wishing to leave them behind. Respected and beloved on his ship, Curly is called a \"great captain\" by his co-workers. He has personal conflicts with his friend and co-pilot, Jimmy, who both admires Curly and envies him. He is responsible yet lenient, and his efforts to see the best in everyone lead to his overlooking conflicts on the ship. He tends to ignore inconvenient details to focus on the bigger picture, both symbolically when he cannot see the dead pixel on the monitor in the lounge and literally when he does nothing about Jimmy after learning he assaulted Anya."

He has some wrinkles and appears to have a thinner body type.\n\nJimmy is shown to experience some semblance of guilt for some of his actions while also being intentionally manipulative and spiteful. He attempts to take responsibility and fix things while not recognizing that his actions are the reason why the crew is even in this position. He often repeats other people's words without understanding their meaning and applies them to himself to excuse the things he's done. \n\nJimmy is very envious of Curly's position as a captain pre-crash, wishing to gain the same amount of power as him, and not recognizing how many responsibilities and tasks a captain has. He acts impulsively and without thinking, such as crashing the ship and regretting it right after, which ultimately leaves Curly severely injured and incapacitated as captain. He lied to the crew and blamed Curly for the crash so he wouldn't have to deal with the consequences. As captain, he quickly got overwhelmed and berated other members of the crew, primarily Anya when she asked him to help with the painkillers. Jimmy often jumps to conclusions, assuming the worst in people and projecting his traits and insecurities onto others.\n\nHe also chooses not to take the Pony Express-mandated psych evaluations seriously, stating that he experiences sexual attraction to a cartoon horse. In Anya's words, Jimmy thinks that they're a waste of time."

Despite having been through medical school 8 times and failing, she continues to go, showing her love and determination for medicine.\n\nBefore her assault, she was seemingly much more lively, getting along well with and trusting the rest of the crew which likely included Jimmy. She seems to have a sense of humor from the yimpy sticky note she pinned, her playful teasing of Swansea enjoying the Pony Express cake, and a competitive streak in board games. She is knowledgeable about the company guidelines and rules, as she brought up the safety manual of Pony Express to find a way to reach the cargo.\n\nAfter her assault however she's become reserved and easily nervous, she has a soft-spoken demeanor and acts meek around the rest of the crew, seeking to avoid Jimmy and protect herself from him. Also hiding the gun case in the medical room so that Jimmy can't find it, fearing for the worst.\n\nPost-crash, her mental health declines rapidly, prone to breakdowns, experiences anxiety, and tends to isolate herself more often than not taking care of Curly. Anya barely speaks for the rest of the game, especially when talking to Jimmy."

He continuously blocks off the path to the utility room claiming that it's filled to the brim with foam, which turned out to be a lie as he was trying to hide the only working cryostasis pod from the other crew members.

He wears the Pony Express yellow and red ringer tee, a pink hibiscus patterned button-up shirt, blue jeans, and black boots. He also has some accessories like silver rings and a red wrist band that matches with his Pony Express t-shirt\n\nDaisuke might be the most optimistic crew member. He is almost always enthusiastic and excited about things happening around the ship: the mentee seems to have felt like he was doing his part just with the menial task of taking stock of the kitchen four times over, as ordered by an exasperated Swansea. Even after the crash, he tries to keep his spirit up. However, despite his peppy exterior, Daisuke later in the game drunkenly confesses to Jimmy that he struggles to find meaning in life and was pressured by his parents to pick up the internship, then continuing to hope that his mother doesn't blame herself.

It began with the sudden eruption of an undersea volcano near the Izu-Ogasawara Trench, southeast of Japan. This unprecedented event triggered a chain reaction of natural disasters, including the eruption of Mount Fuji, megathrust earthquakes, and tsunamis that ravaged surrounding continents.\n\nEntire nations were buried under ash, drowned by towering waves, or shattered by relentless tremors. The survivors are now scattered across a broken world, struggling to adapt to a hostile new reality.",

          "content": "1. Geothermal Activity – The Warm Veins of the Earth\n\nSome islands and regions are located near significant geothermal activity. In these areas, heat from volcanic vents, geysers, or hot springs radiates into the surrounding environment, keeping temperatures warm during the day. However, without direct sunlight to sustain the heat, the temperature plummets after sunset.\n**Example:** A tropical island could be situated near a chain of undersea geothermal vents, which heat the surrounding waters and influence the island's climate. Hot springs or fumaroles scattered across the island add to the warmth but create dangerous terrain.\n\n2. Oceanic Currents – Pockets of Warmth\n\nOceanic currents that remained relatively undisturbed by the Catastrophe may still carry warm water to certain regions. The heat from these currents moderates daytime temperatures on nearby islands, but without sufficient atmospheric insulation at night, the warmth escapes quickly.\n**Example:** Islands near the Kuroshio Current, a warm ocean stream off the coast of Japan, could experience this phenomenon. The current keeps daytime temperatures manageable, but the nights become chilling due to the thin ash-filled atmosphere.\n\n3. Localized Atmospheric Effects\n\nCertain regions might retain warmth due to localized atmospheric conditions, such as persistent thermal inversions or microclimates formed by unique topography. These areas trap daytime heat more effectively but lose it rapidly when the sun sets due to the volcanic ash reducing the atmosphere's ability to retain warmth.\n**Example:** Small valleys or enclosed coastal areas, surrounded by cliffs or mountains, could act as natural heat traps during the day but fail to retain warmth overnight.\n\n4. Volcanic Proximity\n\nAreas near still-active or recently dormant volcanoes may remain warm during the day due to the residual heat of the eruptions. However, these regions are fraught with danger, including toxic gases, unstable ground, and sudden eruptions.\n**Example:** An island near the Pacific Ring of Fire might be warm during the day due to volcanic activity beneath the surface, while its nights are bone-chilling."
