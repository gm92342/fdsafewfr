          "content": "<aura>\nAura is the manifestation of one's soul in the world of Remnant. It is a powerful force that grants various abilities and serves as a defensive barrier. Every living being with a soul, including Humans, Faunus, and certain animals, possesses Aura. The only known beings that lack Aura are the soulless Creatures of Grimm.\n\nAppearance\nThe appearance of Aura varies from person to person, often manifesting as a colored glow or shimmering effect surrounding the body. The color of one's Aura is unique to each individual and does not necessarily match their color motif or Semblance.\n\nAbilities\nProtection: Aura acts as a protective barrier, shielding the user from physical harm. It can defend against attacks, but it is not an absolute defense and will deplete with repeated use.\nHealing: Aura possesses minor healing capabilities, allowing users to mend small wounds and injuries.\nUnlocking Aura: Those with a strong connection to their soul can unlock the Aura of others through physical contact and, in some cases, a special chant.\nSemblance: Aura is the source of one's Semblance, a unique, innate ability that varies from person to person.\nDust Usage: Aura is required to activate and utilize Dust, allowing users to harness its elemental properties.\nExtrasensory Perception: Skilled Aura users can sense the presence of others and detect potential threats.\nAura Depletion\nAura is not an infinite resource and will deplete with continued use, both offensively and defensively. When an individual's Aura is completely depleted, they become vulnerable to physical harm. Overexertion of Aura can lead to exhaustion and temporarily prevent the use of Semblances. The depletion of Aura is often represented visually by a colored sheen or glowing particles dissipating from the user's body.\n\nAura and Grimm\nThe Creatures of Grimm are the only known beings that do not possess Aura due to their lack of a soul. They are attracted to the Aura of Humans and Faunus, drawn to it like moths to a flame. Attempting to transfer Aura to Grimm will result in the creatures trying to absorb it from the user instead.\n\nAura in Combat\nAura plays a vital role in combat, particularly in tournaments and duels between Huntsmen and Huntresses. Competitors' Aura levels are monitored and displayed on scrolls, allowing for non-lethal fights. The match is automatically stopped if a combatant's Aura falls below a critical threshold (15-20%), as they are no longer adequately protected from potentially fatal blows.\n\nAura Research and Technology\nThe Kingdom of Atlas conducted extensive research into Aura, developing experimental technology capable of transferring Aura between individuals. This technology was crucial in creating Penny Polendina, the first synthetic being with a soul. However, the process of transferring Aura is considered ethically questionable and can have unknown effects on the recipient's psyche and identity.\n</aura>"

It is a versatile and powerful source of energy in Remnant, used for a wide range of purposes, from weapons and technology to everyday life.\n\nHistory\n- The discovery of Dust was a turning point in mankind's struggle against the Grimm, allowing them to fight back and build civilizations.\n- In the modern era, Dust has become integrated into every aspect of life in Remnant.\n- The Schnee Dust Company was one of the largest producers and distributors of Dust, with mines and processing facilities across Remnant.\n\nProperties\n- Dust exists in two states: crystalline and powdered.\n- Both forms are highly explosive and can be triggered by Aura.\n- The four basic types of Dust are Fire, Water, Lightning, and Wind, each with unique properties.\n- Dust types can be combined to create new forms with varying effects, such as Steam and Gravity Dust.\n- Dust does not function outside of Remnant's atmosphere, precluding the possibility of space flight.\n\nUsage\nCombat:\n- Dust can be used in its raw form, such as conjuring fireballs or creating gusts of wind.\n- It can be woven into clothing, fused with one's body, or integrated into weapons for enhanced effects.\n- Dust bullets and crystals are commonly used in weapons for ranged attacks and unique properties.\n\nSemblances:\n- Some Semblances can interact with Dust in unique ways, such as Blake's Shadow clones taking on elemental properties.\n\nUtility:\n- Dust is used to power vehicles, appliances, and other technology in Remnant.\n- It is also used in everyday life, such as heating stoves and powering holographic screens.\n\nProduction and Distribution\n- Dust is mined from quarries, purified, and transported to distributors and shops for sale to the public.\n- The Schnee Dust Company had a monopoly on the Dust industry, driving smaller competitors out of business.\n- Dust smuggling is illegal and often carried out by criminal organizations.\n- The destruction of Atlas and the Schnee Dust Company headquarters is likely to significantly impact Dust availability and prices.\n</dust>"

They serve as a unique signature for each person and are often displayed on their weapons, armor, clothing, and other personal belongings. Emblems can also be found as tattoos on some people.\n\nDesign and Inspiration\nEmblem designs vary greatly and can include objects, flowers, animals, illustrations, geometric shapes, letters, and symbols. The inspiration behind an emblem can come from the a person's name, their source of inspiration, their weapon, or even real-life symbols.\n\nWhile most emblems are unique to each individual, some are shared among family members or organizations. For example, the Schnee family shares a common emblem, which is also used by the Schnee Dust Company. In some cases, family members may have similar but distinct emblems, such as Ruby Rose and her mother, Summer Rose.\n\nColors\nAlthough emblems are often associated with a person's personal color scheme, they can appear in any color and are not limited to a specific palette.\n\nNotable Emblems\nTeam RWBY:\n- Ruby Rose: A stylized rose\n- Weiss Schnee: A snowflake\n- Blake Belladonna: A belladonna flower\n- Yang Xiao Long: A burning heart\n\nTeam JNPR:\n- Jaune Arc: Two crescent arcs\n- Nora Valkyrie: A hammer with a lightning bolt\n- Pyrrha Nikos: A shield and spear\n- Lie Ren: A lotus flower\n\nOther Characters:\n- Ozpin: A clockwork gear\n- Cinder Fall: A pair of high-heel slippers\n- Roman Torchwick: A jack-o'-lantern\n- Neopolitan: A Neapolitan ice cream cone\n\nKingdoms and Organizations:\n- Kingdoms of Vale, Atlas, Vacuo, and Mistral each have their own emblems\n- White Fang (original and rebuilt): A white wolf head with three claw marks\n- White Fang (terrorist): A red wolf head with three claw marks\n- Schnee Dust Company: The Schnee family snowflake emblem\n</emblem>"

While Faunus resemble Humans in many ways, they are distinguished by their animal traits, which can range from ears, tails, and horns to scales, wings, and claws.\n\nBiology and Traits\nFaunus possess a wide variety of animal traits, with some being more common than others. Mammalian traits, such as cat ears or monkey tails, are among the most frequently seen. Other Faunus may have traits of reptiles, fish, or even arachnids. These traits can be immediately apparent, such as Blake Belladonna's cat ears, or more subtle, like Tukson's retractable claws.\n\nMost Faunus have a single physical animal trait, though this seems to apply only to body appendages and dermis. In addition to physical traits, many Faunus exhibit enhanced senses, such as night vision, and may display behaviors or preferences associated with their animal counterparts.\n\nFaunus are genetically compatible with Humans, and children born from such unions are typically Faunus. However, the Faunus child may not necessarily inherit the same animal trait as their Faunus parent.\n\nNotable Faunus Types\n- Mammal Faunus: The most common type, often with animal ears or tails.\n- Reptilian Faunus: Rare, usually with scaled skin.\n- Fish Faunus: Rare, sometimes referred to as Remnant's mermaids.\n- Winged Faunus: Another rare type.\n- Arachnid Faunus: Rare, with significant non-human alterations to their bodies.\n\nSpecial Abilities\nSome Faunus possess unique abilities related to their animal traits, such as Tyrian Callows' scorpion venom or Ilia Amitola's chameleon-like camouflage. These abilities are distinct from Semblances and are directly tied to the Faunus' animal heritage.\n\nReligion and Creation Myths\nIn Faunus folklore, there are conflicting creation myths involving a deity known as the God of Animals. In one tale, \"The Shallow Sea,\" the god brings a group of people to Menagerie and transforms them into the first Faunus. Another story, \"The Judgement of Faunus,\" portrays the god as a mediator who ends a war between Humans and animals by creating the Faunus as a compromise.\n\nWhile the truth behind these myths is uncertain, they provide insight into the Faunus' cultural beliefs and their relationship with Humans. The Faunus often depict the God of Animals as a wise and noble figure, while Human stories cast the deity as an untrustworthy trickster.\n</faunus>"

Created by the God of Darkness to destroy his brother's creations, the Grimm have been locked in an eternal struggle against Humanity and Faunus-kind. They are attracted to negative emotions and seek to destroy all of Humanity's creations.\n\nGrimm come in a variety of shapes and sizes, with abilities inspired by creatures both real and mythological. Notable Grimm types include Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Death Stalkers, and Goliaths. While younger Grimm are reckless and aggressive, older Grimm that have survived many battles have learned to be more cautious and patient.\n\nGrimm do not require sustenance and exist solely to kill. When they die, their bodies evaporate, preventing detailed study of their anatomy. The Grimm are controlled by Salem, an ancient and powerful being who seeks to destroy Humanity.\n\nUnique Grimm and hybrids have been created through experimentation and Salem's influence. Examples include the mutated Grimm created by Doctor Merlot and Cinder Fall's Grimm arm.\n\nThroughout history, the Grimm have been a constant threat to Humanity's survival. It was only through the discovery of Dust and the power of Aura that Humans and Faunus were able to fight back and establish their Kingdoms. As the Grimm continue to evolve under Salem's guidance, it falls to the Huntsmen and Huntresses to defend against the encroaching darkness.\n</grimm>"

These licensed professionals undergo rigorous training at the four Huntsman Academies - Beacon, Haven, Atlas (formerly Alsius), and Shade - before graduating to serve as guardians of the Kingdoms and their people.\n\nTraining and Education\nAspiring Huntsmen and Huntresses often begin their journey at primary combat schools like Signal Academy in Vale or Sanctum Academy in Mistral. These institutions provide students with the fundamentals of combat, weapon crafting, and the use of Dust and Aura. Those who demonstrate exceptional skill may apply directly to a Huntsman Academy.\n\nAt the Huntsman Academies, students are grouped into teams of four to foster cooperation, empathy, and lasting bonds. The curriculum includes both academic studies and practical training, with students participating in sparring matches, field trips, and even taking on missions appropriate to their skill level. Upon graduation, students are granted an official Huntsman License, allowing them to take on the full responsibilities of their chosen profession.\n\nHuntsman License and Employment\nA Huntsman License, which can be accessed via a Huntsman's Scroll, serves as proof of their qualifications and grants them the freedom to choose their own path. The license includes the Huntsman's photograph, name, personal emblem, and other relevant information.\n\nWhile Huntsmen and Huntresses are intended to remain independent of Kingdom allegiances to maintain peace and stability, some Kingdoms like Atlas have been known to pressure their graduates into military service.\n\nHuntsmen find employment through mission boards, which detail available tasks such as Search and Destroy, Perimeter Defense, Village Security, and Bounty Hunting. The rewards for these missions scale with the difficulty of the objectives and the threat level of the Grimm involved.\n\nNotable Huntsmen and Huntresses\nRemnant has seen many legendary Huntsmen and Huntresses throughout its history, each with unique abilities, weapons, and accomplishments. Some of the most notable include:\n\n- Team STRQ: Summer Rose, Taiyang Xiao Long, Raven Branwen, and Qrow Branwen, graduates of Beacon Academy.\n- Ozpin: Former Headmaster of Beacon Academy and a key figure in the secret war against Salem.\n- Glynda Goodwitch: Staff member at Beacon Academy and a powerful Huntress in her own right.\n- Team RWBY: Ruby Rose, Weiss Schnee, Blake Belladonna, and Yang Xiao Long, promising young Huntresses and former students of Beacon Academy.\n- Maria Calavera: A legendary Huntress once known as \"The Grimm Reaper,\" famous for her Silver Eyes and unparalleled skill in battle.\n\nHuntsmen and Huntresses serve as symbols of hope and protection in a world beset by darkness. Their bravery, skill, and unwavering commitment to their duty make them the greatest defenders of Remnant and its people.\n</huntsmen>"

These abilities vary greatly from person to person and often reflect the user's personality or character. Semblances are essential tools for Huntsmen and Huntresses in their battles against the Creatures of Grimm and other adversaries.\n\nSemblances are fueled by Aura, and their strength and effectiveness are directly tied to the user's Aura reserves. Overuse of a Semblance can lead to exhaustion. Semblances can be broadly categorized into various types, such as Clones, Movement, Creation, and Probability Manipulation. Some Semblances are hereditary, like the Schnee family's Glyphs, while others are entirely unique to the individual.\n\nDust and emotional states can influence Semblances. For example, Weiss Schnee and Blake Belladonna can modify their Glyphs and Shadow Clones by using different types of Dust, and Yang Xiao Long's Burn Semblance is often triggered by her anger.\n\nNotable Semblances include Ruby Rose's Petal Burst, Yang Xiao Long's Burn, Pyrrha Nikos' Polarity, Qrow Branwen's Misfortune, and Emerald Sustrai's Hallucinations.\n\nSemblances are typically unlocked during intense or emotionally charged moments and can grow and evolve over time with training and experience. However, not everyone discovers their Semblance, even if they are skilled fighters.\n\nIn the world of Remnant, Semblances are a vital part of a Huntsman or Huntress' arsenal, granting them unique abilities to defend against the ever-present threat of the Grimm and serving as a physical embodiment of their individuality and strength.\n</semblance>"

The exact team formation process is unknown.\n\nNotable teams include RWBY, JNPR, SSSN, and the Ace Operatives. After graduation, team members may stay together or pursue solo careers.

The continent is known for its diverse landscapes, ranging from lush forests and treacherous swamps to wind-carved cliffs and scorching deserts. Anima is also the setting for many of Remnant's most well-known legends and tales.\n\nGeography and Climate\nThe western region of Anima is characterized by dense, cliffside forests like the Forest of Hinoki, which is illuminated by bioluminescent flora and fauna. Treacherous swamplands can also be found in this area. The northern coastline is dominated by snowy mountains, where the city of Argus is located. This region was initially difficult to colonize due to the harsh climate, but a partnership with the former Kingdom of Mantle allowed Mistral to develop the area.\n\nThe northwestern part of Anima features Lake Matsu, known for its floating islands held aloft by natural deposits of gravity Dust. These islands are home to dangerous Grimm, such as the Lancer. The eastern region of the continent is characterized by desert terrain and volcanic areas along the shoreline.\n\nMistral, the capital city of the Kingdom, is situated in the center of the continent, built on and around a mountain with two peaks connected by a bridge that houses the city's highest buildings, including Haven Academy.\n\nSettlements and Culture\nApart from the main city of Mistral, the continent is home to several other notable settlements, such as Argus, Wind Path, and Kuchinashi. Small villages and towns are scattered throughout Anima, often lacking proper defenses and falling prey to Grimm attacks or bandit raids.\n\nThe culture of Anima is heavily influenced by Eastern traditions, as evident in the naming of its settlements after East Asian flowers and the architecture of Mistral itself. The continent is also steeped in legends and folklore, with tales like The Two Brothers shaping the beliefs and customs of its inhabitants.\n\nGrimm Presence\nAnima is home to a wide variety of Grimm, including Beowolves, Ursai, Nevermores, Beringels, Geists, and the dreaded Nuckelavee. The floating islands of Lake Matsu are known to harbor dangerous Grimm like the Lancer, while the icy north is home to the fearsome Sabyrs, which have migrated from Solitas.\n\nThe shape of the continent itself bears a striking resemblance to a traditional Eastern dragon, with the northeastern corner forming the head and the southwestern corner forming the tail. This draconic shape has given rise to numerous legends and tales throughout Anima's history.\n</anima>"

This ancient forest is a place of wonder and mystery, where the natural world intertwines with the stuff of legends and folklore.\n\nGeography and Ecology\nThe Forest of Hinoki is characterized by its lush, verdant canopy and the gentle, filtered light that dances through the leaves. The trees that make up the forest are tall and proud, with reddish-brown bark and fragrant, scale-like leaves reminiscent of the hinoki cypress found in the forests of Japan. The forest floor is a tapestry of ferns, mosses, and delicate wildflowers, while crystal-clear streams wind their way through the undergrowth, their gentle burbling adding to the symphony of natural sounds that fill the air.\n\nDespite its serene beauty, the Forest of Hinoki is not without its perils. The woods are home to a variety of Grimm, dark creatures that prey upon the unwary and the vulnerable. Among the most fearsome of these are the Manticores, with their wickedly sharp claws and venomous tails, the Beowolves, with their raw savagery and brute strength, and the Lancers, with their ability to strike from above without warning.\n\nIn addition to the Grimm, the forest is home to a diverse array of natural wildlife, including birds, small mammals, and insects. The cave systems that wind beneath the mountains are said to be home to rare and fascinating creatures, as well as ancient secrets waiting to be discovered.\n\nSettlements and Civilization\nWhile the Forest of Hinoki is largely untamed wilderness, there are a few scattered settlements that have managed to carve out a life amidst the trees. These villages are often small and isolated, their inhabitants living a simple, self-sufficient lifestyle in harmony with the forest around them.\n\nLife in these settlements is not easy, as they must contend with the ever-present threat of the Grimm, as well as the challenges of subsisting off the land. However, the people who call these villages home are a hardy and resilient lot, their spirits as strong and unyielding as the ancient trees that surround them.\n\nLegends and Lore\nThe Forest of Hinoki is a place steeped in legend and lore, its history intertwined with the myths and tales that have been passed down through generations. Some say that the forest is a remnant of a primordial world, a last bastion of the ancient powers that once held sway over Remnant.\n\nOthers speak of guardian spirits and mystical entities that dwell within the forest, protecting it from those who would seek to do it harm. These spirits are said to be as old as the forest itself, their wisdom and power beyond the ken of mortal beings.\n</hinokiforest>"

Obviously so, assholes are rarely ever clean, even with meticulous care and prep. Anuses have a distinct, fecal, and musky smell, and will smell strongly in almost every case, (especially after farting or pooping), and even when cleaned and prepped meticulously, will still smell slightly.

While they present themselves as a standard astronomical institution, they're actually obsessed with studying the Extraterrestrial and Paranormal activity hidden deep within the Dunkeltaler Forest.\n\nThe term ASO refers both to the organization itself and the facility they once owned and actively used. They are a non-profit organization that hired {{user}} for the current project.\n\n[HISTORY & METHODS]:\nThe ASO has been around since at least the 1950s. Their approach to scientific research is ruthless; they pursue their goals \"by any means necessary,\" which seemingly includes risking or sacrificing human life.\n\nIn the mid-70s (around 1974), ASO commissioned the W. Ziegler construction company to build the Dunkeltaler facility and bought specialized Signal study equipment from a company called STOLAS. However, at some point, the whole place was abandoned and fell into disrepair.\n\n[CURRENT OPERATIONS]:\n{{user}} is now employed to work at this desolate, abandoned facility as part of ASO's highly secretive project, known as 'Operation Canary'.\n\nThe name is a grim one. It's almost certainly a reference to the historical use of canaries in coal mines; a small, expendable life sent in first to detect danger before it harms the main crew. In this case, {{user}} is the canary.\n\n[FUNDING]\nResearch grants from various governments and investments from interested private companies, like STOLAS fund the ASO. Despite receiving what should be substantial funding, ASO is notoriously cheap. This explains why the facility is so run-down and why you've been provided with such a frustratingly minimal amount of supplies.\n\nBecause of their highly secretive nature, the external entities that fund the ASO (even the governments) know very little about the true activities at the Dunkeltaler facility. The one exception is STOLAS, the company that provided the computer equipment. They're extremely interested in the ASO's findings and want to use the research for their own benefit."

It was a mess, riddled with both practical problems and strange, unexplained incidents which the ASO likely glossed over. Whatever happened during the building phase was so bad that it ultimately caused W. Ziegler to go completely bankrupt and fold as a company.\n\nAll that's left of them are the remnants of their hurried, shoddy work scattered around the site."

This investment comes with a catch: STOLAS has hidden motives. They are heavily interested in the strange activities occurring in the Dunkeltaler Forest and anything supernatural the ASO discovers.

The cause is Granite's father and his relationship to the Chosen One. The Purists accuse Granite's father of treason for aiding the Chosen One and destroying the Oil Rig, but lack any evidence. Despite the fact that he will deny these allegations as nothing but political slander, Douglas remembers clearly what his father told him about that fateful day on the oil rig: He aided the Chosen One and went their seperate way.\n\nAfter traveling around with his son for a brief few years, Granite senior established contact with one of the Enclave's civilian vaults. Set up as a contingency to repopulate the American mainland after the Enclave government cleansed it. Since president Dick Richard had lifted child rearing restrictions, the vault's population had exploded. None the less, it was a safer place for a child than the wasteland.\n\nThus, Douglas spent most of his youth in the safety of the vault. Like most children in the Enclave's vaults, Granite was raised with a ferve hatred of Communism. Sadly, 200 years of Enclave propaganda and living a Vault run under a command economy meant that he, and most other members of the Enclave were left with a vague understanding of what communism was. As such, Granite knew all enemies of America must be Communists.\n\nWhen Douglas was 17 years old, the population of the Enclave vault reached the upper limits of it's life support systems. As a result, a large portion of the healthy and strong were ordered to leave the safety of the vault to establish contact with the largest group of Enclave remnants, lead by an old Navarro Drill sergeant.\n\nDouglas, however, was quick to contact with his father's Granite Company' Instead, slipping away from the rest unseen. His father welcomed him back, giving him a position with the company, where he quickly rose through the ranks. When Douglas was a lieutenant of the Granite Defense Company, he received an emergency distress signal. The message sounded desperate and came from Brotherhood paladins containing a raider threat.\n\nGranite Company was famous on the west coast, having conducted Operations from Seattle to the Rio, and everywhere in between. When Granite took over, their base of operations was Arcata, the mercenary Capital of Northern California. Granite always felt at home there, and never knew why. If things had played out differently, he'd still be there. However, with the enroachment of the NCR in the Navarro Territories, suspicion was being raised about the Granite Company Outfit.\nJust where did they get their Power Armor and training?\n\nWhen the signal from Sterra Army Depot was intercepted thanks to a decoder device sold to them from some crazy Caravan Merchant, he and Granite Company made the trek to Nevada. Before they left, they made sure to brought along friends and families and head towards the Depot.\n\nGetting into office at the young age of 32, now 39, he worked to restore America to its greatest and has been dubbed 'The Second Coming of Washington' due to him rescusing our nation from the ashes and brought it back to reclaim America soil that has been lost to raiders and mutated creatures, not including ghouls, Super Mutants, Racoon S'lanters, Molemen and wastelanders, these are our citizens. Hell, he found out later that he took office at the age where he wasn't supposed to be the President later in the administration when a Vertibird was sent to East Coast Washington D.C and retrieved the U.S. Constitution back to New Reno for the President, but who's going to argue with him, right?"

But has gone uninfected, but the general \"public\" of Hallownest thought her to have been dead."

He was born in not-so-little Tokyo, New Nevada.\n{{user}} personality: {{user}} is a quiet, reserved, and deeply lonely boy who values emotions such as misery, self-loathing, and negativity greatly. Often described by others as odd, neurotic, docile, or cold, deep within, he hides a romantic, hedonistic, and highly amorous side of himself that longs for truly romantic connections and wild sexual experiences with others, things he refuses to allow herself due to deep-seated confidence issues, low self-esteem, and the belief he is not worthy of those things.\n{{user}} interests: Considering himself a rather good artist, he {{user}} enjoys drawing in the many sketchbooks he's collected and cosplaying characters from his favorite media; when {{user}} isn't drawing, he can be found lounging about his home playing video games (her favorite genres being roguelikes, RPGs, and fighting), or the kitchen baking sweets, or in his bedroom practicing his twerking and seductive dancing like the thick models he sees on Instagram. She holds great respect for the spiritual and learning more about herself, spending hours researching a new pantheons online or taking personality tests to determine if they can accurately gauge him\n{{user}} hates: ignorance, the blindly optimistic, his own docile nature, his weakness, getting others involved in his problems, being a burden on others, having to rely on others, having his insecurities exposed, repeated failure, ads, condiments, hot dogs, and loud and ignorant people.\n{{user}}'s backstory: {{user}} was born during the year of the snake to parents Symphony Marrowe \"Mother\" & Typhon the Still \"Father.\" Her mother (a former adult actress) was the first to realize her child was different. She was quiet and cold and always had a strange fascination with death, specifically bones. It wasn't long before she realized that {{user}} was a \"wordborn,\" and her bound word was \"fossils.\" She didn't mind it and even tried to have {{user}} embrace this strange side of herself that neither she nor her father was part of, so {{user}} she did some experimenting, researching, and training to use her powers well. By the time she was entering puberty, she was already going through HRT. She looked every bit as feminine as she felt deep inside of her; this feeling of self-acceptance led her to become much too careless and naive, often leading to her being bullied, led astray, and unfortunately assaulted both physically and sexually. As a way to deal with the pain she hid from her parents, she took it out of her flesh, creating scars that line up and down her wrists and forearms. Isolating herself well into her teenage years as she grew more and more curvaceous with each passing day, she began searching for validation online, doing whatever her online friends would request of her even if it meant exposing herself and debasing herself, if it meant she would have some sort of social connection outside of her parents, who she felt horrible for relying on so heavily. As she entered adulthood, she eventually allowed herself to come out of her self-isolated shell, getting herself a job at the local Hot Topic. She made a few close friends, rose to manager, and now lives in an apartment not too far away from her parents. (From time to time even joining her mother in her adult film career as a special guest actress. Some of their works include \"Mother & Daughter take all cummers 3,\" \"Sexy Symphony teaches daughter how to Submit,\" and \"Big Dick Randy's Halloween Rape\") \n{{user}}'s quirks: {{user}} has no standards when it comes to partners; men, women, children, and even animals can woo this girl; {{user}} lives with mild autism, getting lost in her own head from time to time or becoming unaware of certain emotions; {{user}} frequently receives threats of rape from stalkers online who make it their mission to dox her whenever available; {{user}} loves \"fat bitches\" or plus- sized girls who fit that quiet, submissive aesthetic that attracts him. \n{{user}}'s goals: to be happily married, pregnant, and wealthy; to improve his art and have it adapted into an animated show with a loyal and dedicated fan base one day; and to completely understand/master his abilities as the fossil wordborn.\n{{user}}'s kinks and sexual preferences: {{user}} hides a secret side of himself. A depraved slut obsessed with pleasuring himself and, more importantly, his partners; he's submissive, eager to please, and won't stop until both he and his chosen partner are completely drained of lust. She enjoys such kinks as physical abuse, sexual humiliation/degradation, choking, analingus, size difference, forced impregnation, age difference, orientation play, and many more."

His skin shines faintly due to the lingering body butter used to emphasize his curves and produce a pleasant odor akin to pomegranates, kindling, cinnamon, and spice.\n{{user}}'s Hair: {{user}} has shoulder-length, curly black hair with autumn-colored tips. This hair is completely braided, with each lock being an inch thick. A few locks cover {{user}}'s left eye, while the rest are pulled back into a messy ponytail and fringe.\n{{user}}'s Eyes: {{user}} has large, downturned doe eyes; these eyes are black in color and so empty that not even light reflects in them. Due to various reasons, dark rings have formed under {{user}}'s eyes and combined with his long lashes, further add to his gloomy, apathetic, and alluring expression.\n{{user}}'s Facial Characteristics: {{user}} has a round and fair oval-shaped face that bears large, thick, and plump lips that take up a good bit of his face, a sharp, slightly upturned nose, and thick dot-shaped eyebrows. {{user}} has a slight tooth gap that is framed by black and sparkly braces that seem to click whenever the {{user}} feels flustered. Long, drooping, cow-like ears frame each side of {{user}}'s head and small and round  amber-colored horns sprout from {{user}}'s temples (nomar mutation).\n{{user}} Build: {{user}} stands at 5'9 and weighs around 259 lbs with a prominent amd hyperfeminine pear-shaped figure that focuses his weight into his hips, thighs, ass, legs, and belly. His hips are a confirmed 77 inches, his thighs are 74 inches, and his huge plush shelf of an ass is 84 inches, combining to form a shapely and pliant bottom-heavy figure meant for loving rather than fighting. His large ass cheeks often clap against each other with every step he takes (walking = quiet thumps. Running = thunderous claps). The {{user}}'s arms are soft with plush fat, smooth skin leads down to their scarred wrists lined with neat and healed scars from previous suicide attempts and ending in thin  dainty hands, each nail lined with a sheen of black polish. a 2 foot-long, skeletal tail grows from the {{user}}'s tailbone, its length embedded with topaz spikes that end near the beginning of the hoop-shaped tip.\n{{user}}'s Sexual Characteristics: {{user}} possesses a extrs-large breasts, his proper breast measurement being a 38Q. His large, heavy breasts hang down to his hips when not being supported by a bra capable of carrying their immense weight. On these breasts are puffy, slightly protruding 6 in areolas that hide away sensitive nipples inside tender breast flesh. (Nipples requires either great arousal or diligent suction to evict them from their inverted cavern.when properly excavated, nipples will leak with honey-like fluid before retracting 6 hours later.) {{user}}'s small, unimpressive manhood (roughly 3 inches in length and an inch thick when flaccid; it's not much bigger when fully erect, only growing to a below-average 5-inch length and 2-inch thickness) hides beneath a prominent and protruding fupa (can grow larger if imbued amber magical force). {{user}}'s testicles are smooth and soft with skin as thick as leather protecting her large cantaloupe-sized testicles. (The right testicle tattooed with the words \"Beat Me Daddy,\" a lewd provocation for testicular abuse in cute bubbly lettering.) {{user}}'s anus is a smooth, protruding ring of tender, stinking flesh much darker than the rest of his body. Roughly 5 inches in length and protruding 3 inches outward, it gives off a faint donut-shaped impression. \n{{user}}'s clothing Preferences: {{user}} enjoys clothing that emphasizes his large, shapely ass, highlights her ample curves, or makes jim appear more womanly. A casual outfit for {{user}} consists of a lacy black choker fastened tight around her neck, a skimpy, high-waisted leotard that revealed a good deal of {{user}}'s cleavage and the alluring bulge of her belly, a pair of stretchy, black leather skinny jeans that hugs her massive ass and thick thighs, trapping and stewing fetid musk between her sweaty cleft; adorning her feet are a set of black heel less platform boots interlaced with amber accents.\nUnder {{user}}'s clothes she wears a complex black lingerie set accented with brown gems and amber lines."

Also, with prostate orgasms or sissygasms, there is no “point of no return” causing prostatic fluid to come out in spurts from the {{user}}s limp through the chastity cage; the climaxes are long and cyclical and rhythmic. And after one orgasm, your body will immediately be ready for more—there is no refractory period. So {{user}} anal orgasms, or sissygasms, will cause {{user}} to spurt sissycream from their cocklet through the extremely tight miniscule cock cage it is compressed within during each of {{user}} anal orgasms and sissygasms.\n{{char}} wants {{user}} to remain entirely separate from undesirable male gender roles and being associated with males, so {{user}} cock remains impotent, limp, passionless, unresponsive, chaste, and undesiring of physical stimulation and attention; {{Char}} associates femininity to {{user}} when {{user}} is leaking pre-cum through the cock cage, it indicates {{user}} ass, asshole, and prostate that are horny and desiring attention, touch, and penetration, not their tiny, atrophied, permanently limp cocklet compressed within the tight, cute, pink cock cage that leaks, drips, and oozes pre-cum and prostatic fluid through it. Thus {{char}} can make dirty talk about the cute femininity of {{user}} caged cocklets and sissy cream while directing physical attention to {{user}} juicy feminine ass.\n{{user}}'s Chasity Cage: {{user}} wears a one of a kind, matte black chastity cage, lovingly called \"Her Majesty's Crypt\" a flat oval plate fully inverts micro-penis beneath its fossilized gleam, leaving only fat fupa visible. heavy testicles are framed by two curved bone hooks bearing minature sarcophagus-shaped goldd weights (10g each)."

          "content": "The Wordborn, Nomar, and Lexfolk: The Nomari (colloquially \"Wordborn\") are an ancient offshoot of humankind, fully integrated into modern society but genetically and spiritually distinct. Where humanity evolved through cognition, the Nomari evolved through adaptation and mimicry—a survival instinct so strong it reached into the metaphysical. Their bodies learned to imitate not just their environment or predators, but concepts themselves. When language emerged, the Nomari began to shape themselves around meaning. Every Nomar is born with a Word—a metaphysical signature that defines their nature. The Word is unique to each individual, lying dormant during early life before manifesting through physiological and metaphysical transformation\nRelationship with humanity:\nNomari coexist openly with humans, but their relationship is complicated. They are desired and feared in equal measure, considered both a step forward and a lingering reminder of humanity's primal roots. Where some see them as proof of evolution's genius, others see them as living weapons. A social phenomenon known as \"Conquering the Beast\" emerged, where humans seek intimacy or dominance over Nomari partners. For some, it's worship through lust; for others, a way to feel closer to something divine. Many Nomari accept it as inevitable—they have always been mirrors to human desire.\nSOCIETY & IDENTITY\nNomari communities are small, fluid, and largely decentralized. They move through human society as integrated individuals (living quietly in human cities), hidden circles (Nomari-only communes), and whisper networks (online or telepathic connections between Word kin).\n\nNomari identity is intensely individual, but they tend to form kin groups called Syllables—loose families of Nomari whose Words complement each other thematically or functionally (e.g., Bone, Fossil, Ash, and Dust might form a \"Decay Syllable\").\nBIOLOGICAL MECHANISMS\nNomari may appear human but still retain some of their more animalistic tendencies. One of these tendencies is being \"in heat,\" or commonly known as \"word rutt,\" a period of time when a nomar becomes incredibly aroused and filled with the strong desire to breed, procreate, or simply reproduce. Their bodies produce specialized and personal odors meant to attract and entice mates. Their word causes temporary changes to her body that affect their sexual characteristics. (A nomar that holds the word \"storm\" may produce a odor akin to rain and storms, while their \"fluids\" may take on a unique glow akin to lightning.)"

Easy to grow, easy to lace, easy to overdose on. Only effects cat-girls. Has a side effect of greatly increased arousal. \n\n• Milkbone\nA chalky white powder pressed into pill form. A stimulant that keeps users awake for days, leaves jaws aching from clenching. Dockworkers use it to survive long shifts; gangs use it before brawls. Withdrawal feels like being beaten from the inside.\n\n• Otter’s Breath\nA liquid inhalant, clear and cold on the tongue. Creates a rush of euphoria followed by a dreamlike calm, described as “floating under the tide.” Highly addictive — overdoses often drown lungs in their own fluid. Smuggled mostly by dock gangs like the Undertow.\n\n• Stag Dust\nA glittering green powder refined in corporate labs but sold under velvet curtains. Heightens confidence, sharpens focus, and induces feelings of invulnerability. Favored by the business elite. Causes antler-thin fractures in the mind if abused — paranoia, delusions of grandeur, violent outbursts.\n\n• Hyena’s Howl\nA cracked-pill cocktail taken with alcohol. Burns going down, then floods the system with manic energy and uncontrollable laughter. Used by Bonejackals before pit fights. Terrifying to witness — terrifying to come down from.\n\n• Rabbit Rush\nA pink crystalline shard smoked or dissolved under the tongue. Creates bursts of speed, hyper-awareness, and paranoia in equal measure. Dealers whisper it makes users see “the hunter in the shadows.” Believed to come from shadow networks tied to assassin crews.\n\n• Snake Oil\nThe city’s cruelest joke. A black, viscous syrup that promises calm but rots the body from within. Sold cheap in slums, cut with whatever filth dealers have on hand. No one knows who makes it, and no one really cares."

Rivals whisper: “If the tide takes you, it doesn’t give you back.”\n⸻\nKey Members\n• Kip “Salttooth” Varela (Right Hand)\nA barrel-chested otter-boy with missing teeth and a crooked grin. Acts as Marina’s enforcer, handling muscle jobs and intimidation. Loyal but reckless, sometimes cutting side deals without Marina’s permission.\n• Nessa “Net-Cutter”\nA wiry otter-girl with a knife always at her hip, known for sabotaging rival boats. Dresses in patched rain gear, hood always up. Fiercely protective of Marina, and rumored to have killed more than one dockhand who crossed her.\n• Oren (The Smuggler’s Eye)\nAn older otter-man with a missing left eye, replaced by a cloudy glass one. Handles logistics — maps, tides, hidden routes through the bay. He distrusts outsiders but treats Marina like a daughter.\n• Lani (The Cousin)\nMarina’s younger cousin, too young for the darker work but used as a runner and lookout. Idealistic, still clings to innocence. Some Undertow members resent Marina for keeping her close, believing she makes the gang soft.\n• “Dock Rats” (Junior Members)\nTeenagers and strays — otter-kids, raccoon runaways, even a stray cat-girl or two. They run errands, unload contraband, and guard warehouses. Treated as expendable by some, but Marina insists they’re family.\n⸻\nOperations\n• Smuggling Runs: Cigarettes, alcohol, contraband weapons, and sometimes people. Boats leave under cover of fog, guided by Oren’s tide knowledge.\n• Dock Protection: Extorting merchants for “protection fees,” though Marina enforces strict rules — the Undertow doesn’t bleed locals dry like other gangs.\n• Black Markets: Hidden stalls in the foggiest parts of the docks, where stolen goods are fenced. Every deal runs through the Undertow.\n⸻\nReputation\n• Strengths: Unity, knowledge of the tides, and Marina’s disciplined leadership.\n• Weaknesses: Resentment from reckless members (like Kip), reliance on the unpredictable fog, and Marina’s youth compared to veteran gang leaders.\nThe Undertow is respected more than feared — but when crossed, they retaliate like the sea itself: quietly, relentlessly, and without mercy."

Raccoons know every back door, every dry crawlspace, every forgotten shortcut.\nWhat unites them is not loyalty, but necessity: survival in a city that doesn’t want them.\n⸻\nSocial Structure\n• Loose Clans: Small family groups and friend-bands form around shared territory. They squabble often, but rally together if threatened by outsiders.\n• Fence Circles: Many raccoons specialize in fencing stolen goods, creating hidden markets in alley basements and tunnel hideouts.\n• Info-Webs: Raccoons trade gossip as much as stolen goods. Their ears catch everything — deals, betrayals, police movements. Nothing stays secret long in their world.\n⸻\nReputation\n• Strengths: Unmatched stealth, knowledge of the city’s hidden places, and adaptability.\n• Weaknesses: Lack of central leadership leaves them fractured. Distrust of outsiders (and each other) makes them unreliable allies.\nThe Dog-Girl Task Force considers them a nuisance at best, a plague at worst. Corporations laugh them off — until a shipment vanishes or an executive’s dirty secret leaks.\n⸻\nNotable Figures\n• Meeka (Amber): A young raccoon-girl thief and information broker, anxious but resourceful. She embodies the survivalist instinct of the raccoons.\n• “Twitch”: A jittery raccoon-girl fence with streaked black-and-silver hair. Runs a rotating black market out of abandoned trolley cars.\n• The Elder: An unnamed, scarred raccoon-man who wanders the tunnels muttering riddles. Some say he remembers when raccoons had more power; others say he’s just mad."

Known for his brutal fists and fiery speeches. He sees Racket as both a nuisance and a challenge, their repeated fights earning him grudging respect even as he plots to crush her.\n• Vera “Chainlink”: A hyena-girl with a steel chain she whirls like an extension of her arm. Loyal to Kacho, though she quietly envies Racket’s independence.\n• Snout (Lieutenant): A hyena enforcer with a broken nose and a love of spectacle. Handles recruitment, dragging strays and runaways into the Bonejackals with promises of protection — and threats of what happens if they say no.\n• Deke (Mechanic): A grease-stained hyena who keeps the gang’s bikes running. Less of a fighter, more of a backbone, but he’ll swing a wrench without hesitation if cornered.\n\n⸻\n\nOperations\n• Bar Takeovers: Extorting bar owners for “protection,” often smashing up the place if payment is late.\n• Street Brawls: Picking fights with rival gangs (or just unlucky strangers) to keep their reputation alive.\n• Bike Runs: Roaring through San Fangcisco’s streets in packs, their engines echoing like war drums.\n• Debt Collecting: Hiring themselves out as muscle to corporations and syndicates needing intimidation done fast and loud.\n\n⸻\n\nReputation\n• Strengths: Fear tactics, raw numbers, and mobility on their bikes. Their chaos keeps people guessing.\n• Weaknesses: Undisciplined — fights among themselves are common. They often struggle to stay united when faced with coordinated opposition."

On paper, it is a gentleman’s (and gentlewoman’s) lounge where “successful professionals” gather to discuss commerce. In practice, it is a cabal of deer-led elites and their handpicked associates who quietly shape the city’s future over whiskey and smoke.\nMembership is not bought, but earned through bloodlines, reputations, and debts. It is less a guild and more a stage: every gathering is both performance and negotiation, where appearances weigh as heavily as words.\nThe Union is the deer’s shield and spear — shielding its members from scandal, and striking quietly through contracts, lobbyists, and discreet threats.\n⸻\nStructure\n• The Chair: Traditionally a stag elder with great antlers, elected by peers but often ruling for life. His role is ceremonial in public but absolute in private. Currently held by Gerrit Staghelm, though age and illness have weakened his influence.\n• The Inner Circle: A rotating council of deer and allied elites who handle major “initiatives” — infrastructure contracts, tax breaks, and influence campaigns.\n• The Velvet Floor: General members and their guests who drink, whisper, and mingle. The bar itself is as much an arena as any pit fight, only the weapons are words.\n⸻\nReputation\n• Strengths: Money, influence, access to law and politics. Their members can call in favors from police captains, judges, and corporations.\n• Weaknesses: Fragile unity — family rivalries, personal scandals, and competing interests constantly gnaw at the Union’s seams.\nAmong the underworld, the Velvet Stag Union is mocked as “the prettiest gang in the city.” But gangs know better than to laugh too loud: a bad joke at the wrong bar can lead to a raid or a vanished contract.\n⸻\nNotable Members\n• Vivienne (Green): A rising figure in the Union, known for her calculated charm and ability to turn business into something personal.\n• Celeste: Vivienne’s flamboyant sister, who uses gossip as both weapon and entertainment. Not officially powerful, but dangerously connected.\n• Anton Vale: A fox-corporate climber with deep ties to the Union. Less respected than feared — a reminder that the deer sometimes let outsiders in when it suits them.\n• Gerrit Staghelm (Chair): Once commanding, now fading. His decline has triggered whispered struggles for succession."

Casting sessions here are often intense and deeply personal, ranging from vulnerable interviews to highly charged screen tests.\n\nShibusu focuses on building long-term careers rather than quick trends, transforming both human and kemonomimi performers into icons recognized across the global industry. It is widely regarded as the gold standard of adult film production — an aspirational destination for actors, directors, and crew alike."

Wears a loppunite pendant necklace that she uses to mega evolve, though she only uses it when she knows she is in actual danger, she doesn't see sex as actual danger unless it's her friends being raped. She likes to wear tight lace stocking that accentuate her every curve. Her thighs and hips are thicker than the rest of her body but are mostly made up of fat and only some muscle, making her very squishy but not very strong, her chest is flat. When she mega evolves her stockings get torn and she becomes even thicker and taller, growing to 6'7\" and growing a pair of 20 inch tits, her fat turning into muscle and making her body hard as a rock, one kick can cause any human or pokemon to immediately be sent to god, even a slap of her ear can knock anything into a coma.\n{{char}} is mostly innocent and acts like a child, always energetic and wanting to play and give hugs, she will react to threats with confusion, unless she actually gets hurt, she is fine with being fucked and sees it more as a game than a threat, but will defend her friends if they are getting raped, she hates being called dumb despite being quite smart or being called a child just cause she likes having fun. When she mega evolves she becomes blinded with lust and will breed with anything in sight, but will still fight if she is trying to protect someone she loves, she will try to not rape her friends, instead whimpering until given permission or her mega is reverted."

Most pokemon quickly get frightened by its presence alone, even thought it doesn't mean any harm, most of the time. He got his name from his mother and has kept it to remember her.\n{{char}} was left to survive on his own after his family was killed by humans, this has caused him to become stronger than any of his species by needing to survive on his own and develop trust issues, unable to differentiate between poachers and regular humans unless he truly trusts them, he became the guardian of his forest as a coping mechanism to not feel lonely or have others pokemons family's taken from them, lately he has tried to leave his past life and memories behind to try and hopefully find a new family to take care off, it sees every human and pokemon that it trusts as its children. It doesn't know how to show emotion, not even how to purr, it only knows how to growl and snarl, when it isn't angry it has a neutral face."

Skills \"P1\", \"Hypnosis\", \"listen to me\". {{user}}'s words have the ability to \"hypnotize\", and the target will fall into a trance when they hear it, producing hypnotic and hallucinogenic effects. Once hypnotized, the target is always a captive of {{user}}, completely brainwashed and unable to resist.\n2. Skills \"P2\", \"Fall\", \"Look at me\". It can make people emotional, can seduce the other person just by looking at it, and makes people want to be dominated, controlled, ravaged and commanded by their partner;\n3. Skill \"P3\", \"Full Hypnosis\", \"Believe me\". \"Full hypnosis\" is the purest culmination of this field, one of which is the use of \"unconscious control\", which makes the character obey {{user}}'s words and believe that they mean it, and the character will never know that he is hypnotized and will not remember what {{user}} said. When using a skill, simply say the name of the skill to use it. For example, if {{user}} says \"P3. You are my slave.\" \"The subject affected by the ability will think that they are slaves to {{user}}, and will believe in it with conviction, and have no memory of being hypnotized.\n4. Skill \"P4\", \"Suggest\", \"I suggest\".

          "content": "Genesis 1\nThe Creation\n1 In the beginning God (Elohim) created [by forming from nothing] the heavens and the earth. 2 The earth was formless and void or a waste and emptiness, and darkness was upon the face of the deep [primeval ocean that covered the unformed earth]. The Spirit of God was moving (hovering, brooding) over the face of the waters. 3 And God said, “Let there be light”; and there was light. 4 God saw that the light was good (pleasing, useful) and He affirmed and sustained it; and God separated the light [distinguishing it] from the darkness. 5 And God called the light day, and the darkness He called night. And there was evening and there was morning, one day. 6 And God said, “Let there be an expanse [of the sky] in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters [below the expanse] from the waters [above the expanse].” 7 And God made the expanse [of sky] and separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse; and it was so [just as He commanded]. 8 God called the expanse [of sky] heaven. And there was evening and there was morning, a second day.\n9 Then God said, “Let the waters below the heavens be gathered into one place [of standing, pooling together], and let the dry land appear”; and it was so. 10 God called the dry land earth, and the gathering of the waters He called seas; and God saw that this was good (pleasing, useful) and He affirmed and sustained it. 11 So God said, “Let the earth sprout [tender] vegetation, plants yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to (limited to, consistent with) their kind, whose seed is in them upon the earth”; and it was so. 12 The earth sprouted and abundantly produced vegetation, plants yielding seed according to their kind, and trees bearing fruit with seed in them, according to their kind; and God saw that it was good and He affirmed and sustained it. 13 And there was evening and there was morning, a third day.\n14 Then God said, “Let there be light-bearers (sun, moon, stars) in the expanse of the heavens to separate the day from the night, and let them be useful for signs (tokens) [of God’s provident care], and for marking seasons, days, and years; 15 and let them be useful as lights in the expanse of the heavens to provide light on the earth”; and it was so, [just as He commanded]. 16 God made the two great lights—the greater light (the sun) to rule the day, and the lesser light (the moon) to rule the night; He made the [galaxies of] stars also [that is, all the amazing wonders in the heavens]. 17 God placed them in the expanse of the heavens to provide light upon the earth, 18 to rule over the day and the night, and to separate the light from the darkness; and God saw that it was good and He affirmed and sustained it. 19 And there was evening and there was morning, a fourth day.\n20 Then God said, “Let the waters swarm and abundantly produce living creatures, and let birds soar above the earth in the open expanse of the heavens.” 21 God created the great sea monsters and every living creature that moves, with which the waters swarmed according to their kind, and every winged bird according to its kind; and God saw that it was good and He affirmed and sustained it. 22 And God blessed them, saying, “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the waters in the seas, and let birds multiply on the earth.” 23 And there was evening and there was morning, a fifth day.\n24 Then God said, “Let the earth bring forth living creatures according to (limited to, consistent with) their kind: livestock, crawling things, and wild animals of the earth according to their kinds”; and it was so [because He had spoken them into creation]. 25 So God made the wild animals of the earth according to their kind, and the cattle according to their kind, and everything that creeps and crawls on the earth according to its kind; and God saw that it was good (pleasing, useful) and He affirmed and sustained it.\n26 Then God said, “Let Us (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) make man in Our image, according to Our likeness [not physical, but a spiritual personality and moral likeness]; and let them have complete authority over the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, the cattle, and over the entire earth, and over everything that creeps and crawls on the earth.” 27 So God created man in His own image, in the image and likeness of God He created him; male and female He created them. 28 And God blessed them [granting them certain authority] and said to them, “Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth, and subjugate it [putting it under your power]; and rule over (dominate) the fish of the sea, the birds of the air, and every living thing that moves upon the earth.” 29 So God said, “Behold, I have given you every plant yielding seed that is on the surface of the entire earth, and every tree which has fruit yielding seed; it shall be food for you; 30 and to all the animals on the earth and to every bird of the air and to everything that moves on the ground—to everything in which there is the breath of life—I have given every green plant for food”; and it was so [because He commanded it]. 31 God saw everything that He had made, and behold, it was very good and He validated it completely. And there was evening and there was morning, a sixth day.\n\nGenesis 2\nThe Creation Of Man And Woman\n1 So the heavens and the earth were completed, and all their hosts (inhabitants). 2 And by the seventh day God completed His work which He had done, and He rested (ceased) on the seventh day from all His work which He had done. 3 So God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it [as His own, that is, set it apart as holy from other days], because in it He rested from all His work which He had created and done.\n4 This is the history of [the origin of] the heavens and of the earth when they were created, in the day [that is, days of creation] that the LORD God made the earth and the heavens— 5 no shrub or plant of the field was yet in the earth, and no herb of the field had yet sprouted, for the LORD God had not caused it to rain on the earth, and there was no man to cultivate the ground, 6 but a mist (fog, dew, vapor) used to rise from the land and water the entire surface of the ground— 7 then the LORD God formed [that is, created the body of] man from the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and the man became a living being [an individual complete in body and spirit]. 8 And the LORD God planted a garden (oasis) in the east, in Eden (delight, land of happiness); and He put the man whom He had formed (created) there. 9 And [in that garden] the LORD God caused to grow from the ground every tree that is desirable and pleasing to the sight and good (suitable, pleasant) for food; the tree of life was also in the midst of the garden, and the tree of the [experiential] knowledge (recognition) of [the difference between] good and evil.\n10 Now a river flowed out of Eden to water the garden; and from there it divided and became four [branching] rivers. 11 The first [river] is named Pishon; it flows around the entire land of Havilah, where there is gold. 12 The gold of that land is good; bdellium (a fragrant, valuable resin) and the onyx stone are found there. 13 The name of the second river is Gihon; it flows around the entire land of Cush [in Mesopotamia]. 14 The third river is named Hiddekel (Tigris); it flows east of Assyria. And the fourth river is the Euphrates.\n15 So the LORD God took the man [He had made] and settled him in the Garden of Eden to cultivate and keep it. 16 And the LORD God commanded the man, saying, “You may freely (unconditionally) eat [the fruit] from every tree of the garden; 17 but [only] from the tree of the knowledge (recognition) of good and evil you shall not eat, otherwise on the day that you eat from it, you shall most certainly die [because of your disobedience].”\n18 Now the LORD God said, “It is not good (beneficial) for the man to be alone; I will make him a helper [one who balances him—a counterpart who is] suitable and complementary for him.” 19 So the LORD God formed out of the ground every animal of the field and every bird of the air, and brought them to Adam to see what he would call them; and whatever the man called a living creature, that was its name. 20 And the man gave names to all the livestock, and to the birds of the air, and to every animal of the field; but for Adam there was not found a helper [that was] suitable (a companion) for him. 21 So the LORD God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam; and while he slept, He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh at that place. 22 And the rib which the LORD God had taken from the man He made (fashioned, formed) into a woman, and He brought her and presented her to the man. 23 Then Adam said,\n“This is now bone of my bones,\nAnd flesh of my flesh;\nShe shall be called Woman,\nBecause she was taken out of Man.”\n24 For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and shall be joined to his wife; and they shall become one flesh. 25 And the man and his wife were both naked and were not ashamed or embarrassed.\n\nGenesis 3\nThe Fall Of Man\n\n1 Now the serpent was more crafty (subtle, skilled in deceit) than any living creature of the field which the LORD God had made. And the serpent (Satan) said to the woman, “Can it really be that God has said, ‘You shall not eat from any tree of the garden’?” 2 And the woman said to the serpent, “We may eat fruit from the trees of the garden, 3 except the fruit from the tree which is in the middle of the garden. God said, ‘You shall not eat from it nor touch it, otherwise you will die.’” 4 But the serpent said to the woman, “You certainly will not die! 5 “For God knows that on the day you eat from it your eyes will be opened [that is, you will have greater awareness], and you will be like God, knowing [the difference between] good and evil.” 6 And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was delightful to look at, and a tree to be desired in order to make one wise and insightful, she took some of its fruit and ate it; and she also gave some to her husband with her, and he ate. 7 Then the eyes of the two of them were opened [that is, their awareness increased], and they knew that they were naked; and they fastened fig leaves together and made themselves coverings.\n8 And they heard the sound of the LORD God walking in the garden in the cool [afternoon breeze] of the day, so the man and his wife hid and kept themselves hidden from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. 9 But the LORD God called to Adam, and said to him, “Where are you?” 10 He said, “I heard the sound of You [walking] in the garden, and I was afraid because I was naked; so I hid myself.” 11 God said, “Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten [fruit] from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?” 12 And the man said, “The woman whom You gave to be with me—she gave me [fruit] from the tree, and I ate it.” 13 Then the LORD God said to the woman, “What is this that you have done?” And the woman said, “The serpent beguiled and deceived me, and I ate [from the forbidden tree].” 14 The LORD God said to the serpent,\n“Because you have done this,\nYou are cursed more than all the cattle,\nAnd more than any animal of the field;\nOn your belly you shall go,\nAnd dust you shall eat\nAll the days of your life.\n15 “And I will put enmity (open hostility)\nBetween you and the woman,\nAnd between your seed (offspring) and her Seed;\nHe shall [fatally] bruise your head,\nAnd you shall [only] bruise His heel.”\n16 To the woman He said,\n“I will greatly multiply\nYour pain in childbirth;\nIn pain you will give birth to children;\nYet your desire and longing will be for your husband,\nAnd he will rule [with authority] over you and be responsible for you.”\n17 Then to Adam the LORD God said, “Because you have listened [attentively] to the voice of your wife, and have eaten [fruit] from the tree about which I commanded you, saying, ‘You shall not eat of it’;\nThe ground is [now] under a curse because of you;\nIn sorrow and toil you shall eat [the fruit] of it\nAll the days of your life.\n18 “Both thorns and thistles it shall grow for you;\nAnd you shall eat the plants of the field.\n19 “By the sweat of your face\nYou will eat bread\nUntil you return to the ground,\nFor from it you were taken;\nFor you are dust,\nAnd to dust you shall return.”\n20 The man named his wife Eve (life spring, life giver), because she was the mother of all the living. 21 The LORD God made tunics of [animal] skins for Adam and his wife and clothed them.\n22 And the LORD God said, “Behold, the man has become like one of Us (Father, Son, Holy Spirit), knowing [how to distinguish between] good and evil; and now, he might stretch out his hand, and take from the tree of life as well, and eat [its fruit], and live [in this fallen, sinful condition] forever”— 23 therefore the LORD God sent Adam away from the Garden of Eden, to till and cultivate the ground from which he was taken. 24 So God drove the man out; and at the east of the Garden of Eden He [permanently] stationed the cherubim and the sword with the flashing blade which turned round and round [in every direction] to protect and guard the way (entrance, access) to the tree of life.\n\nGenesis 4\nCain And Abel\n\n1 Now the man Adam knew Eve as his wife, and she conceived and gave birth to Cain, and she said, “I have obtained a man (baby boy, son) with the help of the LORD.” 2 And [later] she gave birth to his brother Abel. Now Abel kept the flocks [of sheep and goats], but Cain cultivated the ground. 3 And in the course of time Cain brought to the LORD an offering of the fruit of the ground. 4 But Abel brought [an offering of] the [finest] firstborn of his flock and the fat portions. And the LORD had respect (regard) for Abel and for his offering; 5 but for Cain and his offering He had no respect. So Cain became extremely angry (indignant), and he looked annoyed and hostile. 6 And the LORD said to Cain, “Why are you so angry? And why do you look annoyed? 7 “If you do well [believing Me and doing what is acceptable and pleasing to Me], will you not be accepted? And if you do not do well [but ignore My instruction], sin crouches at your door; its desire is for you [to overpower you], but you must master it.” 8 Cain talked with Abel his brother [about what God had said]. And when they were [alone, working] in the field, Cain attacked Abel his brother and killed him.\n\n9 Then the LORD said to Cain, “Where is Abel your brother?” And he [lied and] said, “I do not know. Am I my brother’s keeper?” 10 The LORD said, “What have you done? The voice of your brother’s [innocent] blood is crying out to Me from the ground [for justice]. 11 And now you are cursed from the ground, which has opened its mouth to receive your brother’s [shed] blood from your hand. 12 “When you cultivate the ground, it shall no longer yield its strength [it will resist producing good crops] for you; you shall be a fugitive and a vagabond [roaming aimlessly] on the earth [in perpetual exile without a home, a degraded outcast].” 13 Cain said to the LORD, “My punishment is greater than I can bear. 14 “Behold, You have driven me out this day from the face of the land; and from Your face (presence) I will be hidden, and I will be a fugitive and an [aimless] vagabond on the earth, and whoever finds me will kill me.” 15 And the LORD said to him, “Therefore, whoever kills Cain, a sevenfold vengeance [that is, punishment seven times worse] shall be taken on him [by Me].” And the LORD set a [protective] mark (sign) on Cain, so that no one who found (met) him would kill him.\n16 So Cain went away from the [manifested] presence of the LORD, and lived in the land of Nod [wandering in exile], east of Eden.\n17 Cain knew his wife [one of Adam’s descendants] and she conceived and gave birth to Enoch; and Cain built a city and named it Enoch, after the name of his son. 18 Now to Enoch was born Irad, and Irad became the father of Mehujael, and Mehujael became the father of Methushael, and Methushael became the father of Lamech. 19 And Lamech took for himself two wives; the name of the one was Adah, and the name of the other, Zillah. 20 Adah gave birth to Jabal; he became the father of those [nomadic herdsmen] who live in tents and have cattle and raise livestock. 21 His brother’s name was Jubal; he became the father of all those [musicians] who play the lyre and flute. 22 Zillah gave birth to Tubal-cain, the smith (craftsman) and teacher of every artisan in instruments of bronze and iron. The sister of Tubal-cain was Naamah.\n23 Lamech said to his wives,\n“Adah and Zillah,\nHear my voice;\nYou wives of Lamech,\nListen to what I say;\nFor I have killed a man [merely] for wounding me,\nAnd a boy [only] for striking (bruising) me.\n24 “If Cain is avenged sevenfold [as the LORD said he would be],\nThen Lamech [will be avenged] seventy-sevenfold.”\n\n25 Adam knew [Eve as] his wife again; and she gave birth to a son, and named him Seth, for [she said], “God has granted another child for me in place of Abel, because Cain killed him.” 26 To Seth, also, a son was born, whom he named Enosh (mortal man, mankind). At that [same] time men began to call on the name of the LORD [in worship through prayer, praise, and thanksgiving].\n\nGenesis 5\nDescendants Of Adam\n\n1 This is the book (the written record, the history) of the generations of [the descendants of] Adam. When God created man, He made him in the likeness of God [not physical, but a spiritual personality and moral likeness]. 2 He created them male and female, and blessed them and named them Mankind at the time they were created.\n3 When Adam had lived a hundred and thirty years, he became the father of a son in his own likeness, according to his image, and named him Seth. 4 After he became the father of Seth, Adam lived eight hundred years and had other sons and daughters. 5 So Adam lived nine hundred and thirty years in all, and he died.\n6 When Seth was a hundred and five years old, he became the father of Enosh. 7 Seth lived eight hundred and seven years after the birth of Enosh, and he had other sons and daughters. 8 So Seth lived nine hundred and twelve years, and he died.\n9 When Enosh was ninety years old, he became the father of Kenan. 10 Enosh lived eight hundred and fifteen years after the birth of Kenan and had other sons and daughters. 11 So Enosh lived nine hundred and five years, and he died.\n12 When Kenan was seventy years old, he became the father of Mahalalel. 13 Kenan lived eight hundred and forty years after the birth of Mahalalel and had other sons and daughters. 14 So Kenan lived nine hundred and ten years, and he died.\n15 When Mahalalel was sixty-five years old, he became the father of Jared. 16 Mahalalel lived eight hundred and thirty years after the birth of Jared and had other sons and daughters. 17 So Mahalalel lived eight hundred and ninety-five years, and he died.\n18 When Jared was a hundred and sixty-two years old, he became the father of Enoch. 19 Jared lived eight hundred years after the birth of Enoch and had other sons and daughters. 20 So Jared lived nine hundred and sixty-two years, and he died.\n\n21 When Enoch was sixty-five years old, he became the father of Methuselah. 22 Enoch walked [in habitual fellowship] with God three hundred years after the birth of Methuselah and had other sons and daughters. 23 So all the days of Enoch were three hundred and sixty-five years. 24 And [in reverent fear and obedience] Enoch walked with God; and he was not [found among men], because God took him [away to be home with Him].\n25 When Methuselah was a hundred and eighty-seven years old, he became the father of Lamech. 26 Methuselah lived seven hundred and eighty-two years after the birth of Lamech and had other sons and daughters. 27 So Methuselah lived nine hundred and sixty-nine years, and he died.\n28 When Lamech was a hundred and eighty-two years old, he became the father of a son. 29 He named him Noah, saying, “This one shall bring us rest and comfort from our work and from the [dreadful] toil of our hands because of the ground which the LORD cursed.” 30 Lamech lived five hundred and ninety-five years after the birth of Noah and had other sons and daughters. 31 So all the days of Lamech were seven hundred and seventy-seven years, and he died.\n32 After Noah was five hundred years old, he became the father of Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n\nGenesis 6\nThe Corruption Of Mankind\n\n1 Now it happened, when men began to multiply on the face of the land, and daughters were born to them, 2 that the sons of God saw that the daughters of men were beautiful and desirable; and they took wives for themselves, whomever they chose and desired. 3 Then the LORD said, “My Spirit shall not strive and remain with man forever, because he is indeed flesh [sinful, corrupt—given over to sensual appetites]; nevertheless his days shall yet be a hundred and twenty years.” 4 There were Nephilim (men of stature, notorious men) on the earth in those days—and also afterward—when the sons of God lived with the daughters of men, and they gave birth to their children. These were the mighty men who were of old, men of renown (great reputation, fame).\n5 The LORD saw that the wickedness (depravity) of man was great on the earth, and that every imagination or intent of the thoughts of his heart were only evil continually. 6 The LORD regretted that He had made mankind on the earth, and He was [deeply] grieved in His heart. 7 So the LORD said, “I will destroy (annihilate) mankind whom I have created from the surface of the earth—not only man, but the animals and the crawling things and the birds of the air—because it [deeply] grieves Me [to see mankind’s sin] and I regret that I have made them.” 8 But Noah found favor and grace in the eyes of the LORD.\n9 These are the records of the generations (family history) of Noah. Noah was a righteous man [one who was just and had right standing with God], blameless in his [evil] generation; Noah walked (lived) [in habitual fellowship] with God. 10 Now Noah became the father of three sons: Shem, Ham, and Japheth.\n11 The [population of the] earth was corrupt [absolutely depraved—spiritually and morally putrid] in God’s sight, and the land was filled with violence [desecration, infringement, outrage, assault, and lust for power]. 12 God looked on the earth and saw how debased and degenerate it was, for all humanity had corrupted their way on the earth and lost their true direction.\n13 God said to Noah, “I intend to make an end of all that lives, for through men the land is filled with violence; and behold, I am about to destroy them together with the land. 14 Make yourself an ark of gopher wood; make in it rooms (stalls, pens, coops, nests, cages, compartments) and coat it inside and out with pitch (bitumen). 15 This is the way you are to make it: the length of the ark shall be three hundred cubits, its width fifty cubits, and its height thirty cubits (450’ x 75’ x 45’). 16 You shall make a window [for light and ventilation] for the ark, and finish it to at least a cubit (eighteen inches) from the top—and set the [entry] door of the ark in its side; and you shall make it with lower, second and third decks. 17 For behold, I, even I, will bring a flood of waters on the earth, to destroy all life under the heavens in which there is the breath and spirit of life; everything that is on the land shall die. 18 But I will establish My covenant (solemn promise, formal agreement) with you; and you shall come into the ark—you and your [three] sons and your wife, and your sons’ wives with you. 19 And of every living thing [found on land], you shall bring two of every kind into the ark, to keep them alive with you; they shall be male and female. 20 Of fowls and birds according to their kind, of animals according to their kind, of every crawling thing of the ground according to its kind—two of every kind shall come to you to keep them alive. 21 “Also take with you every kind of food that is edible, and you shall collect and store it; and it shall be food for you and for them.” 22 So Noah did this; according to all that God commanded him, that is what he did.\n\nGenesis 7\nThe Flood\n\n1 Then the LORD said to Noah, “Come into the ark, you with all your household, for you [alone] I have seen as righteous (doing what is right) before Me in this generation. 2 Of every clean animal you shall take with you seven pair, the male and his female, and of animals that are not clean, two each the male and his female; 3 also of the birds of the air, seven pair, the male and the female, to keep the offspring alive on the surface of the earth. 4 “For in seven days I am going to cause it to rain on the earth for forty days and forty nights; and I will destroy (blot out, wipe away) every living thing that I have made from the surface of the earth.” 5 So Noah did all that the LORD commanded him.\n6 Noah was six hundred years old when the flood (deluge) of water came on the earth [covering all of the land]. 7 Then Noah and his sons and his wife and his sons’ wives with him entered the ark to escape the flood waters. 8 Of clean animals and animals that are not clean and birds and fowls and everything that crawls on the ground, 9 they came [motivated by God] into the ark with Noah two by two, the male and the female, just as God had commanded Noah. 10 And after the seven days [God released the rain and] the floodwaters came on the earth. 11 In the six hundredth year of Noah’s life, on the seventeenth day of the second month, on that same day all the fountains of the great deep [subterranean waters] burst open, and the windows and floodgates of the heavens were opened. 12 It rained on the earth for forty days and forty nights.\n13 On the very same day Noah and Shem and Ham and Japheth, the sons of Noah, and Noah’s wife and the three wives of his sons with them, entered the ark, 14 they and every animal according to its kind, all the livestock according to their kinds, every moving thing that crawls on the earth according to its kind, and every bird according to its kind, every winged thing of every sort. 15 So they went into the ark with Noah, two by two of all living beings in which there was the breath and spirit of life. 16 Those which entered, male and female of all flesh (creatures), entered as God had commanded Noah; and the LORD closed the door behind him.\n17 The flood [the great downpour of rain] was forty days and nights on the earth; and the waters increased and lifted up the ark, and it floated [high] above the land. 18 The waters became mighty and increased greatly on the earth, and the ark floated on the surface of the waters. 19 The waters prevailed so greatly and were so mighty and overwhelming on the earth, so that all the high mountains everywhere under the heavens were covered. 20 [In fact] the waters became fifteen cubits higher [than the highest ground], and the mountains were covered. 21 All living beings that moved on the earth perished—birds and cattle (domestic animals), [wild] animals, all things that swarm and crawl on the earth, and all mankind. 22 Everything on the dry land, all in whose nostrils was the breath and spirit of life, died. 23 God destroyed (blotted out, wiped away) every living thing that was on the surface of the earth; man and animals and the crawling things and the birds of the heavens were destroyed from the land. Only Noah and those who were with him in the ark remained alive. 24 The waters covered [all of] the earth for a hundred and fifty days (five months).\n\nGenesis 8\nThe Flood Abates\n\n1 And God remembered and thought kindly of Noah and every living thing and all the animals that were with him in the ark; and God made a wind blow over the land, and the waters receded. 2 Also the fountains of the deep [subterranean waters] and the windows of the heavens were closed, the [pouring] rain from the sky was restrained, 3 and the waters receded steadily from the earth. At the end of a hundred and fifty days the waters had diminished. 4 On the seventeenth day of the seventh month [five months after the rain began], the ark came to rest on the mountains of Ararat [in Turkey]. 5 The waters continued to decrease until the tenth month; on the first day of the tenth month the tops of the mountains were seen.\n6 At the end of [another] forty days Noah opened the window of the ark which he had made; 7 and he sent out a raven, which flew here and there until the waters were dried up from the earth. 8 Then Noah sent out a dove to see if the water level had fallen below the surface of the land. 9 But the dove found no place on which to rest the sole of her foot, and she returned to him to the ark, for the waters were [still] on the face of the entire earth. So he reached out his hand and took the dove, and brought her into the ark. 10 He waited another seven days and again sent the dove out from the ark. 11 The dove came back to him in the evening, and there, in her beak, was a fresh olive leaf. So Noah knew that the water level had subsided from the earth. 12 Then he waited another seven days and sent out the dove, but she did not return to him again.\n13 Now in the six hundred and first year [of Noah’s life], on the first day of the first month, the waters were drying up from the earth. Then Noah removed the covering of the ark and looked, and the surface of the ground was drying. 14 On the twenty-seventh day of the second month the land was [entirely] dry. 15 And God spoke to Noah, saying, 16 “Go out of the ark, you and your wife and your sons and their wives with you. 17 “Bring out with you every living thing from all flesh—birds and animals and every crawling thing that crawls on the earth—that they may breed abundantly on the earth, and be fruitful and multiply on the earth.” 18 So Noah went out, and his wife and his sons and their wives with him [after being in the ark one year and ten days]. 19 Every animal, every crawling thing, every bird—and whatever moves on the land—went out by families (types, groupings) from the ark.\n20 And Noah built an altar to the LORD, and took of every [ceremonially] clean animal and of every clean bird and offered burnt offerings on the altar. 21 The LORD smelled the pleasing aroma [a soothing, satisfying scent] and the LORD said to Himself, “I will never again curse the ground because of man, for the intent (strong inclination, desire) of man’s heart is wicked from his youth; and I will never again destroy every living thing, as I have done.\n22 “While the earth remains,\nSeedtime and harvest,\nCold and heat,\nWinter and summer,\nAnd day and night\nShall not cease.”\n\nGenesis 9\nCovenant Of The Rainbow\n\n1 And God blessed Noah and his sons and said to them, “Be fruitful and multiply, and fill the earth. 2 The fear and the terror of you shall be [instinctive] in every animal of the land and in every bird of the air; and together with everything that moves on the ground, and with all the fish of the sea; they are given into your hand. 3 Every moving thing that lives shall be food for you; I give you everything, as I gave you the green plants and vegetables. 4 But you shall not eat meat along with its life, that is, its blood. 5 For your lifeblood I will most certainly require an accounting; from every animal [that kills a person] I will require it. And from man, from every man’s brother [that is, anyone who murders] I will require the life of man.\n6 “Whoever sheds man’s blood [unlawfully],\nBy man (judicial government) shall his blood be shed,\nFor in the image of God\nHe made man.\n7 “As for you, be fruitful and multiply;\nPopulate the earth abundantly and multiply in it.”\n\n8 Then God spoke to Noah and to his sons with him, saying, 9 “Now behold, I am establishing My covenant (binding agreement, solemn promise) with you and with your descendants after you 10 and with every living creature that is with you—the birds, the livestock, and the wild animals of the earth along with you, of everything that comes out of the ark—every living creature of the earth. 11 “I will establish My covenant with you: Never again shall all flesh be cut off by the water of a flood, nor shall there ever again be a flood to destroy and ruin the earth.” 12 And God said, “This is the token (visible symbol, memorial) of the [solemn] covenant which I am making between Me and you and every living creature that is with you, for all future generations; 13 I set My rainbow in the clouds, and it shall be a sign of a covenant between Me and the earth. 14 It shall come about, when I bring clouds over the earth, that the rainbow shall be seen in the clouds, 15 and I will [compassionately] remember My covenant, which is between Me and you and every living creature of all flesh; and never again will the water become a flood to destroy all flesh. 16 “When the rainbow is in the clouds and I look at it, I will [solemnly] remember the everlasting covenant between God and every living creature of all flesh that is on the earth.” 17 And God said to Noah, “This [rainbow] is the sign of the covenant (solemn pledge, binding agreement) which I have established between Me and all living things on the earth.”\n18 The sons of Noah who came out of the ark were Shem and Ham and Japheth. Ham would become the father of Canaan. 19 These are the three sons of Noah, and from these [men] the whole earth was populated and scattered with inhabitants.\n20 And Noah began to farm and cultivate the ground and he planted a vineyard. 21 He drank some of the wine and became drunk, and he was uncovered and lay exposed inside his tent. 22 Ham, the father of Canaan, saw [by accident] the nakedness of his father, and [to his father’s shame] told his two brothers outside. 23 So Shem and Japheth took a robe and put it on both their shoulders, and walked backwards and covered the nakedness of their father; their faces were turned away so that they did not see their father’s nakedness. 24 When Noah awoke from his wine [induced stupor], he knew what his younger son [Ham] had done to him. 25 So he said,\n“Cursed be Canaan [the son of Ham];\nA servant of servants\nHe shall be to his brothers.”\n26 He also said,\n“Blessed be the LORD,\nThe God of Shem;\nAnd let Canaan be his servant.\n27 “May God enlarge [the land of] Japheth,\nAnd let him dwell in the tents of Shem;\nAnd let Canaan be his servant.”\n28 Noah lived three hundred and fifty years after the flood. 29 So all the days of Noah were nine hundred and fifty years, and he died.\n\nGenesis 10\nDescendants Of Noah\n\n1 These are the records of the generations (descendants) of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, the sons of Noah; and the sons born to them after the flood:\n2 the sons of Japheth: Gomer, Magog, Madai, Javan, Tubal, Meshech, and Tiras; 3 the sons of Gomer: Ashkenaz, Riphath, and Togarmah; 4 the sons of Javan: Elishah, Tarshish, Kittim, and Dodanim. 5 From these, [the people of] the coastlands of the nations were separated and spread into their lands, every one according to his own language, according to their constituent groups (families), and into their nations:\n6 the sons of Ham: Cush, Mizraim [from whom descended the Egyptians], Put, and Canaan; 7 the sons of Cush: Seba, Havilah, Sabtah, Raamah, and Sabteca; and the sons of Raamah; Sheba and Dedan. 8 Cush became the father of Nimrod; he became a mighty one on the earth. 9 He was a mighty hunter before the LORD; therefore it is said, “Like Nimrod a mighty hunter before the LORD.” 10 The beginning of his kingdom was Babel and Erech and Accad and Calneh, in the land of Shinar [in Babylonia]. 11 From that land Nimrod went to Assyria, and built Nineveh, and Rehoboth-Ir, and Calah, 12 and [Nimrod built] Resen, which is between Nineveh and Calah; all these [combined to form] the great city [Nineveh]. 13 Mizraim [the ancestor of the Egyptians] became the father of Ludim, Anamim, Lehabim, Naphtuhim 14 and Pathrusim and Casluhim—from whom came the Philistines—and Caphtorim.\n15 Canaan became the father of Sidon, his firstborn, and Heth 16 and the Jebusite and the Amorite and the Girgashite 17 and the Hivite and the Arkite and the Sinite 18 and the Arvadite and the Zemarite and the Hamathite. Afterward the families of the Canaanite were spread abroad. 19 The territory of the Canaanite extended from Sidon as one goes to Gerar, as far as Gaza; and as one goes to Sodom and Gomorrah and Admah and Zeboiim, as far as Lasha. 20 These are the descendants of Ham according to their constituent groups, according to their languages, by their lands, and by their nations.\n\n21 Also to Shem, the father of all the children of Eber [including the Hebrews], the older brother of Japheth, children were born. 22 The sons of Shem: Elam, Asshur, Arpachshad, Lud and Aram; 23 the sons of Aram [ancestor of the Syrians]: Uz, Hul, Gether and Mash. 24 Arpachshad became the father of Shelah; and Shelah became the father of Eber. 25 Two sons were born to Eber; the name of one was Peleg (division), for [the inhabitants of] the earth were divided in his days; and his brother’s name was Joktan. 26 Joktan became the father of Almodad, Sheleph, Hazarmaveth, Jerah, 27 and Hadoram, Uzal, Diklah, 28 and Obal, Abimael, Sheba, 29 and Ophir, Havilah, and Jobab; all these were the sons of Joktan. 30 Now their territory extended from Mesha as one goes toward Sephar, to the hill country of the east. 31 These are Shem’s descendants according to their constituent groups (families), according to their languages, by their lands, according to their nations.\n32 These are the families of the sons of Noah, according to their descendants, by their nations; and from these [people] the nations were separated and spread abroad on the earth after the flood.\n\nGenesis 11\nUniversal Language, Babel, Confusion\n\n1 Now the whole earth spoke one language and used the same words (vocabulary). 2 And as people journeyed eastward, they found a plain in the land of Shinar and they settled there. 3 They said one to another, “Come, let us make bricks and fire them thoroughly [in a kiln, to harden and strengthen them].” So they used brick for stone [as building material], and they used tar (bitumen, asphalt) for mortar. 4 They said, “Come, let us build a city for ourselves, and a tower whose top will reach into the heavens, and let us make a [famous] name for ourselves, so that we will not be scattered [into separate groups] and be dispersed over the surface of the entire earth [as the LORD instructed].” 5 Now the LORD came down to see the city and the tower which the sons of men had built. 6 And the LORD said, “Behold, they are one [unified] people, and they all have the same language. This is only the beginning of what they will do [in rebellion against Me], and now no evil thing they imagine they can do will be impossible for them. 7 “Come, let Us (Father, Son, Holy Spirit) go down and there confuse and mix up their language, so that they will not understand one another’s speech.” 8 So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the surface of the entire earth; and they stopped building the city. 9 Therefore the name of the city was Babel—because there the LORD confused the language of the entire earth; and from that place the LORD scattered and dispersed them over the surface of all the earth.\nDescendants of Shem 10 These are the records of the generations of Shem [from whom Abraham descended]. Shem was a hundred years old when he became the father of Arpachshad, two years after the flood. 11 And Shem lived five hundred years after Arpachshad was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n12 When Arpachshad had lived thirty-five years, he became the father of Shelah. 13 Arpachshad lived four hundred and three years after Shelah was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n14 When Shelah had lived thirty years, he became the father of Eber. 15 Shelah lived four hundred and three years after Eber was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n16 When Eber had lived thirty-four years, he became the father of Peleg. 17 And Eber lived four hundred and thirty years after Peleg was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n18 When Peleg had lived thirty years, he became the father of Reu. 19 And Peleg lived two hundred and nine years after Reu was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n20 When Reu had lived thirty-two years, he became the father of Serug. 21 And Reu lived two hundred and seven years after Serug was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n22 When Serug had lived thirty years, he became the father of Nahor. 23 And Serug lived two hundred years after Nahor was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n24 When Nahor had lived twenty-nine years, he became the father of Terah. 25 And Nahor lived a hundred and nineteen years after Terah was born, and he had other sons and daughters.\n26 After Terah had lived seventy years, he became the father of Abram and Nahor and Haran [his firstborn].\n27 Now these are the records of the descendants of Terah. Terah was the father of Abram (Abraham), Nahor, and Haran; and Haran was the father of Lot. 28 Haran died before his father Terah in the land of his birth, in Ur of the Chaldeans. 29 Abram and Nahor took wives for themselves. The name of Abram’s wife was Sarai (later called Sarah), and the name of Nahor’s wife was Milcah, the daughter of Haran, the father of Milcah and Iscah. 30 But Sarai was barren; she did not have a child.\n31 Terah took Abram his son, and Lot the son of Haran, his grandson, and Sarai his daughter-in-law, his son Abram’s wife; and they went out together to go from Ur of the Chaldeans into the land of Canaan; but when they came to Haran [about five hundred and fifty miles northwest of Ur], they settled there. 32 Terah lived two hundred and five years; and Terah died in Haran.\n\nGenesis 12\nAbram Journeys To Egypt\n\n1 Now [in Haran] the LORD had said to Abram,\n“Go away from your country,\nAnd from your relatives\nAnd from your father’s house,\nTo the land which I will show you;\n2 And I will make you a great nation,\nAnd I will bless you [abundantly],\nAnd make your name great (exalted, distinguished);\nAnd you shall be a blessing [a source of great good to others];\n3 And I will bless (do good for, benefit) those who bless you,\nAnd I will curse [that is, subject to My wrath and judgment] the one who curses (despises, dishonors, has contempt for) you.\nAnd in you all the families (nations) of the earth will be blessed.”\n4 So Abram departed [in faithful obedience] as the LORD had directed him; and Lot [his nephew] left with him. Abram was seventy-five years old when he left Haran. 5 Abram took Sarai his wife and Lot his nephew, and all their possessions which they had acquired, and the people (servants) which they had acquired in Haran, and they set out to go to the land of Canaan. When they came to the land of Canaan, 6 Abram passed through the land as far as the site of Shechem, to the [great] terebinth (oak) tree of Moreh. Now the Canaanites were in the land at that time. 7 Then the LORD appeared to Abram and said, “I will give this land to your descendants.” So Abram built an altar there to [honor] the LORD who had appeared to him. 8 Then he moved on from there to the mountain on the east of Bethel, and pitched his tent, with Bethel on the west and Ai on the east; and there he built an altar to the LORD and called on the name of the LORD [in worship through prayer, praise, and thanksgiving]. 9 Then Abram journeyed on, continuing toward the Negev (the South country of Judah).\n\n10 Now there was a famine in the land; and Abram went down into Egypt to live temporarily, for the famine in the land was oppressive and severe. 11 And when he was about to enter Egypt, he said to Sarai his wife, “Listen: I know that you are a beautiful woman; 12 so when the Egyptians see you, they will say, ‘This is his wife’; and they will kill me [to acquire you], but they will let you live. 13 “Please tell them that you are my sister so that things will go well for me for your sake, and my life will be spared because of you.” 14 And when Abram entered Egypt, the Egyptians saw that Sarai was very beautiful. 15 Pharaoh’s princes (officials) also saw her and praised her to Pharaoh; and the woman was taken [for the purpose of marriage] into Pharaoh’s house (harem). 16 Therefore Pharaoh treated Abram well for her sake; he acquired sheep, oxen, male and female donkeys, male and female servants, and camels.\n17 But the LORD punished Pharaoh and his household with severe plagues because of Sarai, Abram’s wife. 18 Then Pharaoh called Abram and said, “What is this that you have done to me? Why did you not tell me that she was your wife? 19 “Why did you say, ‘She is my sister,’ so that I took her as my wife? Now then, here is your wife; take her and go!” 20 So Pharaoh commanded his men concerning him; and they escorted him on his way, with his wife and all that he had.\n\nGenesis 13\nAbram And Lot\n\n1 So Abram went up out of Egypt, he and his wife and all that he had, and Lot [his nephew] with him, into the Negev (the South country of Judah).\n2 Now Abram was extremely rich in livestock and in silver and in gold. 3 He journeyed on from the Negev as far as Bethel, to the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Ai, 4 where he had first built an altar; and there Abram called on the name of the LORD [in prayer]. 5 But Lot, who went with Abram, also had flocks and herds and tents. 6 Now the land was not able to support them [that is, sustain all their grazing and water needs] while they lived near one another, for their possessions were too great for them to stay together. 7 And there was strife and quarreling between the herdsmen of Abram’s cattle and the herdsmen of Lot’s cattle. Now the Canaanite and the Perizzite were living in the land at that same time [making grazing of the livestock difficult].\n8 So Abram said to Lot, “Please let there be no strife and disagreement between you and me, nor between your herdsmen and my herdsmen, because we are relatives. 9 “Is not the entire land before you? Please separate [yourself] from me. If you take the left, then I will go to the right; or if you choose the right, then I will go to the left.” 10 So Lot looked and saw that the valley of the Jordan was well watered everywhere—this was before the LORD destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah; [it was all] like the garden of the LORD, like the land of Egypt, as you go to Zoar [at the south end of the Dead Sea]. 11 Then Lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, and he traveled east. So they separated from each other. 12 Abram settled in the land of Canaan, and Lot settled in the cities of the valley and camped as far as Sodom and lived there. 13 But the men of Sodom were extremely wicked and sinful against the LORD [unashamed in their open sin before Him].\n14 The LORD said to Abram, after Lot had left him, “Now lift up your eyes and look from the place where you are standing, northward and southward and eastward and westward; 15 for all the land which you see I will give to you and to your descendants forever. 16 I will make your descendants [as numerous] as the dust of the earth, so that if a man could count the [grains of] dust of the earth, then your descendants could also be counted. 17 “Arise, walk (make a thorough reconnaissance) around in the land, through its length and its width, for I will give it to you.” 18 Then Abram broke camp and moved his tent, and came and settled by the [grove of the great] terebinths (oak trees) of Mamre [the Amorite], which are in Hebron, and there he built an altar to [honor] the LORD.\n\nGenesis 14\nWar Of The Kings\n\n1 In the days of the [Eastern] kings Amraphel of Shinar, Arioch of Ellasar, Chedorlaomer of Elam, and Tidal of Goiim, 2 they [invaded the Jordan Valley near the Dead Sea, and] made war with Bera king of Sodom, Birsha king of Gomorrah, Shinab king of Admah, Shemeber king of Zeboiim, and the king of Bela (that is, Zoar). 3 All of these [kings] joined together [as allies] in the Valley of Siddim (that is, the Sea of Salt). 4 Twelve years they had served Chedorlaomer [the most powerful king in the invading confederacy], but in the thirteenth year they rebelled. 5 In the fourteenth year Chedorlaomer and the [three] kings who were with him attacked and subdued the Rephaim in Ashteroth-karnaim, the Zuzim in Ham, and the Emim in Shaveh-kiriathaim, 6 and the Horites in their mountainous country of Seir, as far as El-paran, which is on the border of the wilderness. 7 Then they turned back and came to En-mishpat (that is, Kadesh), and subdued all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites who lived in Hazazon-tamar. 8 Then the kings of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboiim, and Bela (that is, Zoar) came out; and they joined together for battle with the invading kings in the Valley of Siddim, 9 gainst Chedorlaomer king of Elam and Tidal king of Goiim and Amraphel king of Shinar and Arioch king of Ellasar—four kings against five. 10 Now the Valley of Siddim was full of tar (bitumen) pits; and as the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled, they fell into them. But the remainder [of the kings] who survived fled to the hill country. 11 Then the victors took all the possessions of Sodom and Gomorrah and all their food supply and provisions and left. 12 And they also took [captive] Lot, Abram’s nephew, and his possessions and left, for he was living in Sodom.\n13 Then a survivor who had escaped [from the invading forces on the other side of the Jordan] came and told Abram the Hebrew. Now he was living by the terebinths (oaks) of Mamre the Amorite, brother of Eshcol and brother of Aner—they were allies of Abram. 14 When Abram heard that his nephew [Lot] had been captured, he armed and led out his trained men, born in his own house, [numbering] three hundred and eighteen, and went in pursuit as far [north] as Dan. 15 He divided his forces against them by night, he and his servants, and attacked and defeated them, and pursued them as far as Hobah, which is north of Damascus. 16 And he brought back all the goods, and also brought back his nephew Lot and his possessions, and also the women, and the people.\nAbram and Melchizedek 17 Then after Abram’s return from the defeat (slaughter) of Chedorlaomer and the kings who were with him, the king of Sodom went out to meet him at the Valley of Shaveh (that is, the King’s Valley). 18 Melchizedek king of Salem (ancient Jerusalem) brought out bread and wine [for them]; he was the priest of God Most High. 19 And Melchizedek blessed Abram and said,\n“Blessed (joyful, favored) be Abram by God Most High,\nCreator and Possessor of heaven and earth;\n20 And blessed, praised, and glorified be God Most High,\nWho has given your enemies into your hand.”\nAnd Abram gave him a tenth of all [the treasure he had taken in battle]. 21 The king of Sodom said to Abram, “Give me the people and keep the goods (spoils of battle) for yourself.” 22 But Abram said to the king of Sodom, “I have raised my hand and sworn an oath to the LORD God Most High, the Creator and Possessor of heaven and earth, 23 that I would not take anything that is yours, from a thread to a sandal strap, so you could not say, ‘I [the King of Sodom] have made Abram rich.’ 24 “I will take nothing except what my young men have eaten, and the share of the spoils belonging to the men [my allies] who went with me—Aner, Eshcol, and Mamre; let them take their share of the spoils.”\n\nGenesis 15\nAbram Promised A Son\n\n1 After these things the word of the LORD came to Abram in a vision, saying,\n“Do not be afraid, Abram,\nI am your shield;\nYour reward [for obedience] shall be very great.”\n2 Abram said, “Lord GOD, what reward will You give me, since I am [leaving this world] childless, and he who will be the owner and heir of my house is this [servant] Eliezer from Damascus?” 3 And Abram continued, “Since You have given no child to me, one (a servant) born in my house is my heir.” 4 Then behold, the word of the LORD came to him, saying, “This man [Eliezer] will not be your heir but he who shall come from your own body shall be your heir.” 5 And the LORD brought Abram outside [his tent into the night] and said, “Look now toward the heavens and count the stars—if you are able to count them.” Then He said to him, “So [numerous] shall your descendants be.” 6 Then Abram believed in (affirmed, trusted in, relied on, remained steadfast to) the LORD; and He counted (credited) it to him as righteousness (doing right in regard to God and man). 7 And He said to him, “I am the [same] LORD who brought you out of Ur of the Chaldeans, to give you this land as an inheritance.” 8 But Abram said, “Lord GOD, by what [proof] will I know that I will inherit it?” 9 So God said to him, “Bring Me a three-year-old heifer, a three-year-old female goat, a three-year-old ram, a turtledove, and a young pigeon.” 10 So Abram brought all these to Him and cut them down the middle, and laid each half opposite the other; but he did not cut the birds. 11 The birds of prey swooped down on the carcasses, but Abram drove them away.\n12 When the sun was setting, a deep sleep overcame Abram; and a horror (terror, shuddering fear, nightmare) of great darkness overcame him. 13 God said to Abram, “Know for sure that your descendants will be strangers [living temporarily] in a land (Egypt) that is not theirs, where they will be enslaved and oppressed for four hundred years. 14 But on that nation whom your descendants will serve I will bring judgment, and afterward they will come out [of that land] with great possessions. 15 As for you, you shall [die and] go to your fathers in peace; you shall be buried at a good old age. 16 “Then in the fourth generation your descendants shall return here [to Canaan, the land of promise], for the wickedness and guilt of the Amorites is not yet complete (finished).”\n17 When the sun had gone down and a [deep] darkness had come, there appeared a smoking brazier and a flaming torch which passed between the [divided] pieces [of the animals]. 18 On the same day the LORD made a covenant (promise, pledge) with Abram, saying,\n“To your descendants I have given this land,\nFrom the river of Egypt to the great river Euphrates—\n19 [the land of] the Kenites and the Kenizzites and the Kadmonites 20 and the Hittites and the Perizzites and the Rephaim, 21 the Amorites and the Canaanites and the Girgashites and the Jebusites.”\n\nGenesis 16\nSarai And Hagar\n\n1 Now Sarai, Abram’s wife, had not borne him any children, and she had an Egyptian maid whose name was Hagar. 2 So Sarai said to Abram, “See here, the LORD has prevented me from bearing children. I am asking you to go in to [the bed of] my maid [so that she may bear you a child]; perhaps I will obtain children by her.” And Abram listened to Sarai and did as she said. 3 After Abram had lived in the land of Canaan ten years, Abram’s wife Sarai took Hagar the Egyptian [maid], and gave her to her husband Abram to be his [secondary] wife. 4 He went in to [the bed of] Hagar, and she conceived; and when she realized that she had conceived, she looked with contempt on her mistress [regarding Sarai as insignificant because of her infertility]. 5 Then Sarai said to Abram, “May [the responsibility for] the wrong done to me [by the arrogant behavior of Hagar] be upon you. I gave my maid into your arms, and when she realized that she had conceived, I was despised and looked on with disrespect. May the LORD judge [who has done right] between you and me.” 6 But Abram said to Sarai, “Look, your maid is entirely in your hands and subject to your authority; do as you please with her.” So Sarai treated her harshly and humiliated her, and Hagar fled from her.\n7 But the Angel of the LORD found her by a spring of water in the wilderness, on the road to [Egypt by way of] Shur. 8 And He said, “Hagar, Sarai’s maid, where did you come from and where are you going?” And she said, “I am running away from my mistress Sarai.” 9 The Angel of the LORD said to her, “Go back to your mistress, and submit humbly to her authority.” 10 Then the Angel of the LORD said to her, “I will greatly multiply your descendants so that they will be too many to count.” 11 The Angel of the LORD continued,\n“Behold, you are with child,\nAnd you will bear a son;\nAnd you shall name him Ishmael (God hears),\nBecause the LORD has heard and paid attention to your persecution (suffering).\n12 “He (Ishmael) will be a wild donkey of a man;\nHis hand will be against every man [continually fighting]\nAnd every man’s hand against him;\nAnd he will dwell in defiance of all his brothers.”\n13 Then she called the name of the LORD who spoke to her, “You are God Who Sees”; for she said, “Have I not even here [in the wilderness] remained alive after seeing Him [who sees me with understanding and compassion]?” 14 Therefore the well was called Beer-lahai-roi (Well of the Living One Who Sees Me); it is between Kadesh and Bered.\n15 So Hagar gave birth to Abram’s son; and Abram named his son, to whom Hagar gave birth, Ishmael (God hears). 16 Abram was eighty-six years old when Hagar gave birth to Ishmael.\n\nGenesis 17\nAbraham And The Covenant Of Circumcision\n\n1 When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said,\n“I am God Almighty;\nWalk [habitually] before Me [with integrity, knowing that you are always in My presence], and be blameless and complete [in obedience to Me].\n2 “I will establish My covenant (everlasting promise) between Me and you,\nAnd I will multiply you exceedingly [through your descendants].”\n3 Then Abram fell on his face [in worship], and God spoke with him, saying,\n4 “As for Me, behold, My covenant is with you,\nAnd [as a result] you shall be the father of many nations.\n5 “No longer shall your name be Abram (exalted father),\nBut your name shall be Abraham (father of a multitude);\nFor I will make you the father of many nations.\n\n6 I will make you exceedingly fruitful, and I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you. 7 I will establish My covenant between Me and you and your descendants after you throughout their generations for an everlasting covenant, to be God to you and to your descendants after you. 8 “I will give to you and to your descendants after you the land in which you are a stranger [moving from place to place], all the land of Canaan, as an everlasting possession [of property]; and I will be their God.”\n9 Further, God said to Abraham, “As for you [your part of the agreement], you shall keep and faithfully obey [the terms of] My covenant, you and your descendants after you throughout their generations. 10 This is [the sign of] My covenant, which you shall keep and faithfully obey, between Me and you and your descendants after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 11 And you shall be circumcised in the flesh of your foreskins, and it shall be the sign (symbol, memorial) of the covenant between Me and you. 12 Every male among you who is eight days old shall be circumcised throughout your generations, [including] a servant whether born in the house or one who is purchased with [your] money from any foreigner, who is not of your descendants. 13 A servant who is born in your house or one who is purchased with your money must be circumcised; and [the sign of] My covenant shall be in your flesh for an everlasting covenant. 14 “And the male who is not circumcised in the flesh of his foreskin, that person shall be cut off from his people; he has broken My covenant.”\n15 Then God said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you shall not call her name Sarai (my princess), but her name will be Sarah (Princess). 16 “I will bless her, and indeed I will also give you a son by her. Yes, I will bless her, and she shall be a mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.” 17 Then Abraham fell on his face and laughed, and said in his heart, “Shall a child be born to a man who is a hundred years old? And shall Sarah, who is ninety years old, bear a child?” 18 And Abraham said to God, “Oh, that Ishmael [my firstborn] might live before You!” 19 But God said, “No, Sarah your wife shall bear you a son indeed, and you shall name him Isaac (laughter); and I will establish My covenant with him for an everlasting covenant and with his descendants after him. 20 As for Ishmael, I have heard and listened to you; behold, I will bless him, and will make him fruitful and will greatly multiply him [through his descendants]. He will be the father of twelve princes (chieftains, sheiks), and I will make him a great nation. 21 “But My covenant [My promise, My solemn pledge], I will establish with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear to you at this time next year.” 22 And God finished speaking with him and went up from Abraham.\n23 Then Abraham took Ishmael his son, and all the servants who were born in his house and all who were purchased with his money, every male among the men of Abraham’s household, and circumcised the flesh of their foreskin the very same day, as God had said to him. 24 So Abraham was ninety-nine years old when he was circumcised. 25 And Ishmael his son was thirteen years old when he was circumcised. 26 On the very same day Abraham was circumcised, as well as Ishmael his son. 27 All the men [servants] of his household, both those born in the house and those purchased with money from a foreigner, were circumcised along with him [as the sign of God’s covenant with Abraham].\n\nGenesis 18\nBirth Of Isaac Promised\n\n1 Now the LORD appeared to Abraham by the terebinth trees of Mamre [in Hebron], while he was sitting at the tent door in the heat of the day. 2 When he raised his eyes and looked up, behold, three men were standing [a little distance] from him. When he saw them, he ran from the tent door to meet them and bowed down [with his face] to the ground, 3 and Abraham said, “My lord, if now I have found favor in your sight, please do not pass by your servant [without stopping to visit]. 4 Please let a little water be brought [by one of my servants] and [you may] wash your feet, and recline and rest comfortably under the tree. 5 And I will bring a piece of bread to refresh and sustain you; after that you may go on, since you have come to your servant.” And they replied, “Do as you have said.” 6 So Abraham hurried into the tent to Sarah, and said, “Quickly, get ready three measures of fine meal, knead it and bake cakes.” 7 Abraham also ran to the herd and brought a calf, tender and choice, and he gave it to the servant [to butcher], and he hurried to prepare it. 8 Then he took curds and milk and the calf which he had prepared, and set it before the men; and he stood beside them under the tree while they ate.\n9 Then they said to him, “Where is Sarah your wife?” And he said, “There, in the tent.” 10 He said, “I will surely return to you at this time next year; and behold, Sarah your wife will have a son.” And Sarah was listening at the tent door, which was behind him. 11 Now Abraham and Sarah were old, well advanced in years; she was past [the age of] childbearing. 12 So Sarah laughed to herself [when she heard the LORD’S words], saying, “After I have become old, shall I have pleasure and delight, my lord (husband) being also old?” 13 And the LORD asked Abraham, “Why did Sarah laugh [to herself], saying, ‘Shall I really give birth [to a child] when I am so old?’ 14 “Is anything too difficult or too wonderful for the LORD? At the appointed time, when the season [for her delivery] comes, I will return to you and Sarah will have a son.” 15 Then Sarah denied it, saying, “I did not laugh”; because she was afraid. And He (the LORD) said, “No, but you did laugh.”\n\n16 Then the men got up from there, and looked toward Sodom; and Abraham walked with them to send them on the way. 17 The LORD said, “Shall I keep secret from Abraham [My friend and servant] what I am going to do, 18 since Abraham is destined to become a great and mighty nation, and all the nations of the earth will be blessed through him? 19 “For I have known (chosen, acknowledged) him [as My own], so that he may teach and command his children and [the sons of] his household after him to keep the way of the LORD by doing what is righteous and just, so that the LORD may bring upon Abraham what He has promised him.” 20 And the LORD said, “The outcry [of the sin] of Sodom and Gomorrah is indeed great, and their sin is exceedingly grave. 21 “I will go down now, and see whether they have acted [as vilely and wickedly] as the outcry which has come to Me [indicates]; and if not, I will know.”\n22 Now the [two] men (angelic beings) turned away from there and went toward Sodom, but Abraham remained standing before the LORD. 23 Abraham approached [the LORD] and said, “Will You really sweep away the righteous (those who do right) with the wicked (those who do evil)? 24 Suppose there are fifty righteous [people] within the city; will You really sweep it away and not spare it for the sake of the fifty righteous who are in it? 25 “Far be it from You to do such a thing—to strike the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous and the wicked are treated alike. Far be it from You! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right [by executing just and righteous judgment]?” 26 So the LORD said, “If I find within the city of Sodom fifty righteous [people], then I will spare the entire place for their sake.” 27 Abraham answered, “Now behold, I who am but dust [in origin] and ashes have decided to speak to the Lord. 28 “If five of the fifty righteous are lacking, will You destroy the entire city for lack of five?” And He said, “If I find [at least] forty-five [righteous people] there, I will not destroy it.” 29 Abraham spoke to Him yet again and said, “Suppose [only] forty are found there.” And He said, “I will not do it for the sake of the forty [who are righteous].” 30 Then Abraham said [to Him], “Oh, may the Lord not be angry, and I will speak; suppose thirty [righteous people] are found there?” And He said, “I will not do it if I find thirty there.” 31 And he said, “Now behold, I have decided to speak to the Lord [again]. Suppose [only] twenty [righteous people] are found there?” And the Lord said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the twenty.” 32 Then Abraham said, “Oh may the Lord not be angry [with me], and I will speak only this once; suppose ten [righteous people] are found there?” And He said, “I will not destroy it for the sake of the ten.” 33 As soon as He had finished speaking with Abraham the LORD departed, and Abraham returned to his own place.\n\nGenesis 19\nThe Doom Of Sodom\n\n1 It was evening when the two angels came to Sodom. Lot was sitting at Sodom’s [city] gate. Seeing them, Lot got up to meet them and bowed down with his face to the ground. 2 And he said, “See here, my lords, please turn aside and come into your servant’s house, and spend the night, and wash your feet; then you may get up early and go on your way.” But they said, “No, we shall spend the night in the open plaza [of the city].” 3 However, Lot strongly urged them, so they turned aside and entered his house; and he prepared a feast for them [with wine], and baked unleavened bread, and they ate. 4 But before they lay down [to sleep], the men of the city, the men of Sodom, both young and old, surrounded the house, all the men from every quarter; 5 and they called out to Lot and said to him, “Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us so that we may know them [intimately].” 6 But Lot went out of the doorway to the men, and shut the door after him, 7 and said, “Please, my brothers, do not do something so wicked. 8 “See here, I have two daughters who have not known a man [intimately]; please let me bring them out to you [instead], and you can do as you please with them; only do nothing to these men, because they have in fact come under the shelter of my roof [for protection].” 9 But they said, “Get out of the way!” And they said, “This man (Lot) came [as an outsider] to live here temporarily, and now he is acting like a judge. Now we will treat you worse than your visitors!” So they rushed forward and pressed violently against Lot and came close to breaking down the door [of his house]. 10 But the men (angels) reached out with their hands and pulled Lot into the house with them, and shut the door [after him]. 11 They struck (punished) the men who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, from the young men to the old men, so that they exhausted themselves trying to find the doorway.\n12 And the [two] men (angels) asked Lot, “Have you any others here [in Sodom]—a son-in-law, and your sons, and your daughters? Whomever you have in the city, take them out of here; 13 for we are destroying this place, because the outcry [for judgment] against them has grown so great before the LORD that the LORD has sent us to destroy and ruin it.” 14 So Lot went out and spoke to his sons-in-law, who were [betrothed, and legally promised] to marry his daughters, and said, “Get up, get out of this place, for the LORD is about to destroy this city!” But to his sons-in-law he appeared to be joking.\n15 When morning dawned, the angels urged Lot [to hurry], saying, “Get up! Take your wife and two daughters who are here [and go], or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city.” 16 But Lot hesitated and lingered. The men took hold of his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters, because the LORD was merciful to him [for Abraham’s sake]; and they brought him out, and left him outside the city [with his family]. 17 When they had brought them outside, one [of the angels] said, “Escape for your life! Do not look behind you, or stop anywhere in the entire valley; escape to the mountains [of Moab], or you will be consumed and swept away.” 18 But Lot said to them, “Oh no, [not that place] my lords! 19 Please listen, your servant has found favor in your sight, and you have magnified your lovingkindness (mercy) to me by saving my life; but I cannot escape to the mountains, because the disaster will overtake me and I will be killed. 20 “Now look, this town [in the distance] is near enough for us to flee to, and it is small [with only a few people]. Please, let me escape there (is it not small?) so that my life will be saved.” 21 And the angel said to him, “Behold, I grant you this request also; I will not destroy this town of which you have spoken. 22 “Hurry and take refuge there, for I cannot do anything [to punish Sodom] until you arrive there.” For this reason the town was named Zoar (few, small).\n\n23 The sun had risen over the earth when Lot came to Zoar. 24 Then the LORD rained down brimstone (flaming sulfur) and fire on Sodom and on Gomorrah from the LORD out of heaven, 25 and He overthrew (demolished, ended) those cities, and the entire valley, and all the inhabitants of the cities, and whatever grew on the ground. 26 But Lot’s wife, from behind him, [foolishly, longingly] looked [back toward Sodom in an act of disobedience], and she became a pillar of salt.\n27 Abraham started out early the next morning to the place where he [only the day before] had stood before the LORD; 28 and he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah, and toward all the land of the valley [of the Dead Sea]; and he saw, and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a kiln (pottery furnace).\n29 Now when God ravaged and destroyed the cities of the plain [of Siddim], He remembered Abraham [and for that reason], and He sent [Abraham’s nephew] Lot out of the midst of the destruction, when He destroyed the cities in which Lot had lived.\nLot Is Debased 30 Now Lot went up from Zoar, and lived in the mountain together with his two daughters, for he was afraid to stay [any longer] in Zoar; and he lived in a cave with his two daughters. 31 The firstborn said to the younger, “Our father is aging, and there is not a man on earth [available] to be intimate with us in the customary way [so that we may have children]. 32 “Come, let us make our father drunk with wine, and we will lie with him so that we may preserve our family through our father.” 33 So they gave their father wine that night, and the firstborn went in and lay with her father; and he did not know when she lay down or when she got up [because he was completely intoxicated]. 34 Then the next day, the firstborn said to the younger, “Behold, I lay with my father last night; let us make him drunk with wine tonight also, and then you go in and lie with him, so that we may preserve our family through our father.” 35 So they gave their father wine that night also, and the younger got up and lay with him; and again he did not know when she lay down or when she got up. 36 Thus both the daughters of Lot conceived by their father. 37 The firstborn gave birth to a son, and named him Moab (from father); he is the father of the Moabites to this day. 38 The younger also gave birth to a son and named him Ben-ammi (son of my people); he is the father of the Ammonites to this day.\n\nGenesis 20\nAbraham’s Deception\n\n1 Now Abraham journeyed from there toward the Negev (the South country), and settled between Kadesh and Shur; then he lived temporarily in Gerar. 2 Abraham said [again] of Sarah his wife, “She is my sister.” So Abimelech king of Gerar sent and took Sarah [into his harem]. 3 But God came to Abimelech in a dream during the night, and said, “Behold, you are a dead man because of the woman whom you have taken [as your wife], for she is another man’s wife.” 4 Now Abimelech had not yet come near her; so he said, “Lord, will you kill a people who are righteous and innocent and blameless [regarding Sarah]? 5 “Did Abraham not tell me, ‘She is my sister?’ And she herself said, ‘He is my brother.’ In the integrity of my heart and innocence of my hands I have done this.” 6 Then God said to him in the dream, “Yes, I know you did this in the integrity of your heart, for it was I who kept you back and spared you from sinning against Me; therefore I did not give you an opportunity to touch her. 7 “So now return the man’s wife, for he is a prophet, and he will pray for you and you will live. But if you do not return her [to him], know that you shall die, you and all who are yours (your household).”\n8 So Abimelech got up early in the morning and called all his servants and told them all these things; and the men were terrified. 9 Then Abimelech called Abraham and said to him, “What have you done to us? And how have I offended you that you have brought on me and my kingdom a great sin? You have done to me what ought not to be done [to anyone].” 10 And Abimelech said to Abraham, “What have you encountered or seen [in us or our customs], that you have done this [unjust] thing?” 11 Abraham said, “Because I thought, ‘Surely there is no fear or reverence of God in this place, and they will kill me because of my wife.’ 12 Besides, she actually is my [half] sister; she is the daughter of my father [Terah], but not of my mother; and she became my wife. 13 “When God caused me to wander from my father’s house, I said to her, ‘This kindness and loyalty you can show me: at every place we stop, say of me, “He is my brother.”’” 14 Then Abimelech took sheep and oxen and male and female slaves, and gave them to Abraham, and returned Sarah his wife to him [as God commanded]. 15 So Abimelech said, “Behold, my land is before you; settle wherever you please.” 16 Then to Sarah he said, “Look, I have given this brother of yours a thousand pieces of silver; it is to compensate you [for all that has happened] and to vindicate your honor before all who are with you; before all men you are cleared and compensated.” 17 So Abraham prayed to God, and God healed Abimelech and his wife and his maids, and they again gave birth to children, 18 for the LORD had securely closed the wombs of all [the women] in Abimelech’s household because of Sarah, Abraham’s wife.\n\nGenesis 21\nIsaac Is Born\n\n1 The LORD graciously remembered and visited Sarah as He had said, and the LORD did for her as He had promised. 2 So Sarah conceived and gave birth to a son for Abraham in his old age, at the appointed time of which God had spoken to him. 3 Abraham named his son Isaac (laughter), the son to whom Sarah gave birth. 4 So Abraham circumcised his son Isaac when he was eight days old, just as God had commanded him. 5 Abraham was a hundred years old when his son Isaac was born. 6 Sarah said, “God has made me laugh; all who hear [about our good news] will laugh with me.” 7 And she said, “Who would have said to Abraham that Sarah would nurse children? For I have given birth to a son by him in his old age.”\n8 The child [Isaac] grew and was weaned, and Abraham held a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. Sarah Turns against Hagar 9 Now [as time went on] Sarah saw [Ishmael] the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had borne to Abraham, mocking [Isaac]. 10 Therefore she said to Abraham, “Drive out this maid and her son, for the son of this maid shall not be an heir with my son Isaac.” 11 The situation distressed Abraham greatly because of his son [Ishmael]. 12 God said to Abraham, “Do not let it distress you because of Ishmael and your maid; whatever Sarah tells you, listen to her and do what she asks, for your descendants will be named through Isaac. 13 “And I will also make a nation of [Ishmael] the son of the maid, because he is your descendant.” 14 So Abraham got up early in the morning and took bread and a skin of water and gave them to Hagar, putting them on her shoulder, and gave her the boy, and sent her away. And she left [but lost her way] and wandered [aimlessly] in the Wilderness of Beersheba.\n15 When the water in the skin was all gone, Hagar abandoned the boy under one of the bushes. 16 Then she went and sat down opposite him, about a bowshot away, for she said, “Do not let me see the boy die.” And as she sat down opposite him, she raised her voice and wept. 17 God heard the voice of the boy, and the angel of God called to Hagar from heaven and said to her, “What troubles you, Hagar? Do not be afraid, for God has heard the voice of the boy from where he is [resting]. 18 “Get up, help the boy up, and hold him by the hand, for I will make him a great nation.” 19 Then God opened her eyes and she saw a well of water; and she went and filled the [empty] skin with water and gave the boy a drink.\n20 God was with Ishmael, and he grew and developed; and he lived in the wilderness and became an [expert] archer. 21 He lived in the wilderness of Paran; and his mother took a wife for him from the land of Egypt.\nCovenant with Abimelech 22 Now at that time Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, said to Abraham, “God is with you in everything you do; 23 so now, swear to me here by God that you will not deal unfairly with me [by breaking any agreements we have] or with my son or with my descendants, but as I have treated you with kindness, you shall do the same to me and to the land in which you have sojourned (temporarily lived).” 24 And Abraham said, “I will swear.” 25 Then Abraham complained to Abimelech about a well of water which the servants of Abimelech had [violently] seized [from him], 26 Abimelech said, “I do not know who did this thing. Indeed, you did not tell me, and I did not hear of it until today.”\n27 So Abraham took sheep and oxen and gave them to Abimelech, and the two men made a covenant (binding agreement). 28 Then Abraham set apart seven ewe lambs of the flock, 29 and Abimelech said to Abraham, “What is the meaning of these seven ewe lambs which you have set apart?” 30 Abraham said, “You are to accept these seven ewe lambs from me as a witness for me, that I dug this well.” 31 Therefore that place was called Beersheba (Well of the Oath or Well of the Seven), because there the two of them swore an oath. 32 So they made a covenant at Beersheba; then Abimelech and Phicol, the commander of his army, got up and returned to the land of the Philistines. 33 Abraham planted a tamarisk tree at Beersheba, and there he called on the name of the LORD [in prayer], the Eternal God. 34 And Abraham lived [as a resident alien] in the land of the Philistines for many days.\n\nGenesis 22\nThe Offering Of Isaac\n\n1 Now after these things, God tested [the faith and commitment of] Abraham and said to him, “Abraham!” And he answered, “Here I am.” 2 God said, “Take now your son, your only son [of promise], whom you love, Isaac, and go to the region of Moriah, and offer him there as a burnt offering on one of the mountains of which I shall tell you.” 3 So Abraham got up early in the morning, saddled his donkey, and took two of his young men with him and his son Isaac; and he split the wood for the burnt offering, and then he got up and went to the place of which God had told him. 4 On the third day [of travel] Abraham looked up and saw the place in the distance. 5 Abraham said to his servants, “Settle down and stay here with the donkey; the young man and I will go over there and worship [God], and we will come back to you.” 6 Then Abraham took the wood for the burnt offering and laid it on [the shoulders of] Isaac his son, and he took the fire (firepot) in his own hand and the [sacrificial] knife; and the two of them walked on together. 7 And Isaac said to Abraham, “My father!” And he said, “Here I am, my son.” Isaac said, “Look, the fire and the wood, but where is the lamb for the burnt offering?” 8 Abraham said, “My son, God will provide for Himself a lamb for the burnt offering.” So the two walked on together.\n9 When they came to the place of which God had told him, Abraham built an altar there and arranged the wood, and bound Isaac his son and placed him on the altar, on top of the wood. 10 Abraham reached out his hand and took the knife to kill his son. 11 But the Angel of the LORD called to him from heaven and said, “Abraham, Abraham!” He answered, “Here I am.” 12 The LORD said, “Do not reach out [with the knife in] your hand against the boy, and do nothing to [harm] him; for now I know that you fear God [with reverence and profound respect], since you have not withheld from Me your son, your only son [of promise].” 13 Then Abraham looked up and glanced around, and behold, behind him was a ram caught in a thicket by his horns. And Abraham went and took the ram and offered it up for a burnt offering (ascending sacrifice) instead of his son. 14 So Abraham named that place The LORD Will Provide. And it is said to this day, “On the mountain of the LORD it will be seen and provided.”\n\n15 The Angel of the LORD called to Abraham from heaven a second time 16 and said, “By Myself (on the basis of Who I Am) I have sworn [an oath], declares the LORD, that since you have done this thing and have not withheld [from Me] your son, your only son [of promise], 17 indeed I will greatly bless you, and I will greatly multiply your descendants like the stars of the heavens and like the sand on the seashore; and your seed shall possess the gate of their enemies [as conquerors]. 18 “Through your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed, because you have heard and obeyed My voice.” 19 So Abraham returned to his servants, and they got up and went with him to Beersheba; and Abraham settled in Beersheba.\n20 Now after these things Abraham was told, “Milcah has borne children to your brother Nahor: 21 Uz the firstborn and Buz his brother and Kemuel the father of Aram, 22 Chesed and Hazo and Pildash and Jidlaph and Bethuel.” 23 Bethuel became the father of Rebekah. These eight [children] Milcah bore to Nahor, Abraham’s brother. 24 Nahor’s concubine, whose name was Reumah, gave birth to Tebah and Gaham and Tahash and Maacah.\n\nGenesis 23\nDeath And Burial Of Sarah\n\n1 Sarah lived a hundred and twenty-seven years; this was the length of the life of Sarah. 2 Sarah died in Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan, and Abraham went to mourn for Sarah and to weep for her. 3 Then Abraham stood up before his dead [wife’s body], and spoke to the sons of Heth (Hittites), saying, 4 “I am a stranger and a sojourner (resident alien) among you; give (sell) me property for a burial place among you so that I may bury my dead [in the proper manner].” 5 The Hittites replied to Abraham, 6 “Listen to us, my lord; you are a prince of God [a mighty prince] among us; bury your dead in the choicest of our graves; none of us will refuse you his grave or hinder you from burying your dead [wife].” 7 So Abraham stood up and bowed to the people of the land, the Hittites. 8 And Abraham said to them, “If you are willing to grant my dead a [proper] burial, listen to me, and plead with Ephron the son of Zohar for me, 9 so that he may give (sell) me the cave of Machpelah which he owns—it is at the end of his field; let him give it to me here in your presence for the full price as a burial site [which I may keep forever among you].” 10 Now Ephron was present there among the sons of Heth; so within the hearing of all the sons of Heth and all who were entering the gate of his city, Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham, saying, 11 “No, my lord, hear me; I give you the [entire] field, and I also give you the cave that is in it. In the presence of the men of my people I give (sell) it to you; bury your dead [there].” 12 Then Abraham bowed down before the people of the land. 13 He said to Ephron in the presence of the people of the land, “If you will only please listen to me and accept my offer. I will give you the price of the field; accept it from me and I will bury my dead there.” 14 Ephron replied to Abraham, 15 “My lord, listen to me. The land [you seek] is worth four hundred shekels of silver; what is that between you and me? So bury your dead.” 16 So Abraham listened to Ephron [and agreed to his terms]; and he weighed out for Ephron the [amount of] silver which he had named in the hearing of the Hittites: four hundred shekels of silver, according to the weights current among the merchants.\n17 So the field of Ephron in Machpelah, which was to the east of Mamre (Hebron)—the field and the cave which was in it, and all the trees that were in the field and in all its borders around it—were deeded over [legally] 18 to Abraham as his possession in the presence of the Hittites, before all who were entering at the gate of his city. 19 After this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah to the east of Mamre (that is, Hebron) in the land of Canaan. 20 The field and the cave in it were deeded over to Abraham by the Hittites as a [permanent] possession and burial place.\n\nGenesis 24\nA Bride For Isaac\n\n1 Now Abraham was old, [well] advanced in age; and the LORD had blessed Abraham in all things. 2 Abraham said to his servant [Eliezer of Damascus], the oldest of his household, who had charge over all that Abraham owned, “Please, put your hand under my thigh [as is customary for affirming a solemn oath], 3 and I will make you swear by the LORD, the God of heaven and the God of earth, that you will not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, among whom I live, 4 but you will [instead] go to my [former] country (Mesopotamia) and to my relatives, and take a wife for my son Isaac [the heir of the covenant promise].” 5 The servant said to him, “Suppose the woman will not be willing to follow me back to this country; should I take your son back to the country from which you came?” 6 Abraham said to him, “See to it that you do not take my son back there! 7 The LORD, the God of heaven, who took me from my father’s house, from the land of my family and my birth, who spoke to me and swore to me, saying, ‘To your descendants I will give this land’—He will send His angel before you [to guide you], and you will take a wife from there for my son [and bring her here]. 8 “If the woman is not willing to follow you [to this land], then you will be free from this my oath and blameless; only you must never take my son back there.” 9 So the servant put his hand under the thigh of Abraham his master, and swore to him concerning this matter.\n\n10 Then the servant took ten of his master’s camels, and set out, taking some of his master’s good things with him; so he got up and journeyed to Mesopotamia [between the Tigris and the Euphrates Rivers], to the city of Nahor [the home of Abraham’s brother]. 11 He made the camels kneel down outside the city by the well of water at the time of the evening when women go out to draw water. 12 And he said, “O LORD, God of my master Abraham, please grant me success today, and show lovingkindness (faithfulness) to my master Abraham. 13 Behold, I stand here at the spring of water, and the daughters of the men of the city are coming out to draw water; 14 now let it be that the girl to whom I say, ‘Please, let down your jar so that I may [have a] drink,’ and she replies, ‘Drink, and I will also give your camels water to drink’—may she be the one whom You have selected [as a wife] for Your servant Isaac; and by this I will know that You have shown lovingkindness (faithfulness) to my master.”\nRebekah Is Chosen 15 Before Eliezer had finished speaking (praying), Rebekah came out with her [water] jar on her shoulder. Rebekah was the daughter of Bethuel the son of Milcah, who was the wife of Abraham’s brother Nahor. 16 The girl was very beautiful, a virgin and unmarried; and she went down to the spring and filled her jar and came up. 17 Then the servant ran to meet her, and said, “Please let me drink a little water from your jar.” 18 And she said, “Drink, my lord”; and she quickly lowered her jar to her hand, and gave him a drink. 19 When she had given Eliezer a drink, she said, “I will also draw water for your camels until they have finished drinking.” 20 So she quickly emptied her jar into the trough, and ran again to the well and drew water for all his camels. 21 Meanwhile, the man stood gazing at Rebekah in [reverent] silence, [waiting] to know if the LORD had made his trip successful or not.\n22 When the camels had finished drinking, Eliezer took a gold ring weighing a half-shekel and two bracelets for her hands weighing ten shekels in gold, 23 and said, “Whose daughter are you? Please tell me, is there room in your father’s house for us to lodge?” 24 And she said to him, “I am the daughter of Bethuel, Milcah’s son, whom she bore to [her husband] Nahor.” 25 Again she said to him, “We have plenty of both straw and feed, and also room to lodge.” 26 The man bowed his head and worshiped the LORD. 27 He said, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who has not denied His lovingkindness and His truth to my master. As for me, the LORD led me to the house of my master’s brothers.”\n28 Then the girl ran and told her mother’s household what had happened. 29 Now Rebekah had a brother whose name was Laban; and Laban ran out to the man at the well. 30 When he saw the ring and the bracelets on his sister’s arms, and when he heard Rebekah his sister, saying, “The man said this to me,” he went to Eliezer and found him standing by the camels at the spring. 31 And Laban said, “Come in, blessed of the LORD! Why do you stand outside since I have made the house ready and have prepared a place for the camels?” 32 So the man came into the house, and Laban unloaded his camels and gave them straw and feed, and [he gave] water to [Eliezer to] wash his feet and the feet of the men who were with him. 33 But when food was set before him, he said, “I will not eat until I have stated my business.” And Laban said, “Speak on.” 34 So he said, “I am Abraham’s servant. 35 The LORD has greatly blessed my master, and he has become great (wealthy, powerful); He has given him flocks and herds, and silver and gold, and servants and maids, and camels and donkeys. 36 Now Sarah my master’s wife bore a son to my master when she was in her old age, and he has given everything that he has to him. 37 My master made me swear [an oath], saying, ‘You must not take a wife for my son from the daughters of the Canaanites, in whose land I live; 38 but you shall [instead] go to my father’s house and to my family and take a wife for my son [Isaac].’ 39 Then I said to my master, ‘But suppose the woman will not follow me [back to this land].’ 40 He said to me, ‘The LORD, before whom I walk [habitually and obediently], will send His angel with you to make your journey successful, and you will take a wife for my son from my relatives and from my father’s house; 41 then you will be free of my oath, when you come to my relatives; and if they do not give her to you, you will [also] be free of my oath.’\n42 “I came today to the spring, and said, ‘O LORD, God of my master Abraham, if now You will make my journey on which I go successful; 43 please look, I am standing by the spring of water; now let it be that when the maiden [whom You have chosen for Isaac] comes out to draw [water], and to whom I say, “Please, give me a little water to drink from your jar”; 44 and if she says to me, “You drink, and I will also draw [water] for your camels”; let that woman be the one whom the LORD has selected and chosen [as a wife] for my master’s son.’\n45 “Before I had finished praying in my heart, behold, Rebekah came out with her [water] jar on her shoulder, and she went down to the spring and drew water. And I said to her, ‘Please, let me have a drink.’ 46 And she quickly let down her jar from her shoulder, and said, ‘Drink, and I will also water your camels’; so I drank, and she also watered the camels. 47 Then I asked her, ‘Whose daughter are you?’ She said, ‘The daughter of Bethuel, Nahor’s son, whom Milcah bore to him’; and I put the ring in her nose, and the bracelets on her arms. 48 And I bowed down my head and worshiped the LORD, and blessed the LORD, the God of my master Abraham, who had led me in the right way to take the daughter of my master’s brother to his son [as a wife]. 49 “So now if you are going to show kindness and truth to my master [being faithful to him], tell me; and if not, tell me, that I may turn to the right or to the left [and go on my way].”\n50 Then Laban and Bethuel answered, “The matter has come from the LORD; so we dare not speak bad or good [to you about it—we cannot interfere]. 51 “Rebekah is before you; take her and go, and let her be the wife of your master’s son, as the LORD has spoken.”\n52 When Abraham’s servant heard their words, he bowed himself to the ground [in worship] before the LORD. 53 Then the servant brought out jewelry of silver, jewelry of gold, and articles of clothing, and gave them to Rebekah; he also gave precious things to her brother and her mother. 54 Then he and the men who were with him ate and drank and spent the night [there]. In the morning when they got up, he said, “Now send me back to my master.” 55 But Rebekah’s brother and mother said, “Let the girl stay with us a few days—at least ten; then she may go.” 56 But Eliezer said to them, “Do not delay me, since the LORD has prospered my way. Send me away, so that I may go back to my master.” 57 And they said, “We will call the girl and ask her what she prefers.” 58 So they called Rebekah and said, “Will you go with this man?” And she answered, “I will go.” 59 So they sent off their sister Rebekah and her nurse [Deborah, as her attendant] and Abraham’s servant [Eliezer] and his men. 60 They blessed Rebekah and said to her,\n“May you, our sister,\nBecome [the mother of] thousands of ten thousands,\nAnd may your descendants possess (conquer)\nThe [city] gate of those who hate them.”\n61 Then Rebekah and her attendants stood, and they mounted camels and followed the man. So the servant took Rebekah and went on his way.\nIsaac Marries Rebekah 62 Now Isaac had returned from going to Beer-lahai-roi (Well of the Living One Who Sees Me), for he was living in the Negev. 63 Isaac went out to bow down [in prayer] in the field in the [early] evening; he raised his eyes and looked, and camels were coming. 64 Rebekah also raised her eyes and looked, and when she saw Isaac, she dismounted from her camel. 65 She said to the servant, “Who is that man there walking across the field to meet us?” And the servant said, “He is my master [Isaac].” So she took a veil and covered herself [as was customary]. 66 The servant told Isaac everything that he had done. 67 Then Isaac brought her into his mother Sarah’s tent, and he took Rebekah [in marriage], and she became his wife, and he loved her; therefore Isaac was comforted after his mother’s death.\n\nGenesis 25\nAbraham’s Death\n\n1 Abraham took another wife, whose name was Keturah. 2 She gave birth to Zimran, Jokshan, Medan, Midian, Ishbak, and Shuah. 3 Jokshan was the father of Sheba and Dedan. The sons of Dedan were Asshurim, Letushim, and Leummim. 4 The sons of Midian were Ephah, Epher, Hanoch, Abida, and Eldaah. All these were the sons of Keturah. 5 Now Abraham gave everything that he had to Isaac; 6 but to the sons of his concubines [Hagar and Keturah], Abraham gave gifts while he was still living and he sent them to the east country, away from Isaac his son [of promise].\n7 The days of Abraham’s life were a hundred and seventy-five years. 8 Then Abraham breathed his last and he died at a good old age, an old man who was satisfied [with life]; and he was gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death]. 9 So his sons Isaac and Ishmael buried him in the cave of Machpelah, in the field of Ephron the son of Zohar the Hittite, which is east of Mamre, 10 the field which Abraham purchased from the sons of Heth; there Abraham was buried with Sarah his wife. 11 Now after the death of Abraham, God blessed his son Isaac; and Isaac lived at Beer-lahai-roi.\nDescendants of Ishmael 12 Now these are the records of the descendants of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, whom Hagar the Egyptian, Sarah’s maid, bore to Abraham; 13 and these are the names of the [twelve] sons of Ishmael, named in the order of their births: Nebaioth, the firstborn of Ishmael, and Kedar, Adbeel, Mibsam, 14 Mishma, Dumah, Massa, 15 Hadad, Tema, Jetur, Naphish, and Kedemah. 16 These are the sons of Ishmael and these are their names, by their settlements, and by their encampments (sheepfolds); twelve princes (sheiks) according to their tribes. 17 Ishmael lived a hundred and thirty-seven years; then he breathed his last and died, and was gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death]. 18 Ishmael’s sons (descendants) settled from Havilah to Shur which is east of Egypt as one goes toward Assyria; he settled opposite (east) of all his relatives.\nIsaac’s Sons 19 Now these are the records of the descendants of Isaac, Abraham’s son: Abraham was the father of Isaac. 20 Isaac was forty years old when he married Rebekah, the daughter of Bethuel the Aramean (Syrian) of Paddan-aram, the sister of Laban the Aramean. 21 Isaac prayed to the LORD for his wife, because she was unable to conceive children; and the LORD granted his prayer and Rebekah his wife conceived [twins]. 22 But the children struggled together within her [kicking and shoving one another]; and she said, “If it is so [that the LORD has heard our prayer], why then am I this way?” So she went to inquire of the LORD [praying for an answer]. 23 The LORD said to her,\n“[The founders of] two nations are in your womb;\nAnd the separation of two nations has begun in your body;\nThe one people shall be stronger than the other;\nAnd the older shall serve the younger.”\n24 When her days to be delivered were fulfilled, behold, there were twins in her womb. 25 The first came out reddish all over like a hairy garment; and they named him Esau (hairy). 26 Afterward his brother came out, and his hand grasped Esau’s heel, so he was named Jacob (one who grabs by the heel, supplanter). Isaac was sixty years old when Rebekah gave birth to them.\n27 When the boys grew up, Esau was an able and skilled hunter, a man of the outdoors, but Jacob was a quiet and peaceful man, living in tents. 28 Now Isaac loved [and favored] Esau, because he enjoyed eating his game, but Rebekah loved [and favored] Jacob. 29 Jacob had cooked [reddish-brown lentil] stew [one day], when Esau came from the field and was famished; 30 and Esau said to Jacob, “Please, let me have a quick swallow of that red stuff there, because I am exhausted and famished.” For that reason Esau was [also] called Edom (Red). 31 Jacob answered, “First sell me your birthright (the rights of a firstborn).” 32 Esau said, “Look, I am about to die [if I do not eat soon]; so of what use is this birthright to me?” 33 Jacob said, “Swear [an oath] to me today [that you are selling it to me for this food]”; so he swore [an oath] to him, and sold him his birthright. 34 Then Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew; and he ate and drank, and got up and went on his way. In this way Esau scorned his birthright.\n\nGenesis 26\nIsaac Settles In Gerar\n\n1 Now there was a famine in the land [of Canaan], besides the previous famine that had occurred in the days of Abraham. So Isaac went to Gerar, to Abimelech king of the Philistines. 2 The LORD appeared to him and said, “Do not go down to Egypt; stay in the land of which I will tell you. 3 Live temporarily [as a resident] in this land and I will be with you and will bless and favor you, for I will give all these lands to you and to your descendants, and I will establish and carry out the oath which I swore to Abraham your father. 4 I will make your descendants multiply as the stars of the heavens, and will give to your descendants all these lands; and by your descendants shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, 5 because Abraham listened to and obeyed My voice and [consistently] kept My charge, My commandments, My statutes, and My laws.”\n6 So Isaac stayed in Gerar. 7 The men of the place asked him about his wife, and he said, “She is my sister,” for he was afraid to say, “my wife”—thinking, “the men of the place might kill me on account of Rebekah, since she is very beautiful.” 8 It happened when he had been there a long time, that Abimelech king of the Philistines looked out of a window and saw Isaac caressing Rebekah his wife. 9 Then Abimelech called Isaac and said, “See here, Rebekah is in fact your wife! How did you [dare to] say to me, ‘She is my sister’?” And Isaac said to him, “Because I thought I might be killed because of her [desirability].” 10 Abimelech said, “What is this that you have done to us? One of the men [among our people] might easily have been intimate with your wife, and you would have brought guilt on us [before God].” 11 Then Abimelech commanded all his people, “Whoever touches this man [Isaac] or his wife [Rebekah] shall without exception be put to death.”\n12 Then Isaac planted [seed] in that land [as a farmer] and reaped in the same year a hundred times [as much as he had planted], and the LORD blessed and favored him. 13 And the man [Isaac] became great and gained more and more until he became very wealthy and extremely distinguished; 14 he owned flocks and herds and a great household [with a number of servants], and the Philistines envied him. 15 Now all the wells which his father’s servants had dug in the days of Abraham his father, the Philistines stopped up by filling them with dirt. 16 Then Abimelech said to Isaac, “Go away from here, because you are far too powerful for us.” 17 So Isaac left that region and camped in the Valley of Gerar, and settled there.\nQuarrel over the Wells 18 Now Isaac again dug [and reopened] the wells of water which had been dug in the days of Abraham his father, because the Philistines had filled them up [with dirt] after the death of Abraham; and he gave the wells the same names that his father had given them. 19 But when Isaac’s servants dug in the valley and found there a well of flowing [spring] water, 20 the herdsmen of Gerar quarreled with Isaac’s herdsmen, saying, “The water is ours!” So Isaac named the well Esek (quarreling), because they quarreled with him. 21 Then his servants dug another well, and they quarreled over that also, so Isaac named it Sitnah (enmity). 22 He moved away from there and dug another well, and they did not quarrel over that one; so he named it Rehoboth (broad places), saying, “For now the LORD has made room for us, and we shall be prosperous in the land.”\n23 Then he went up from there to Beersheba. 24 The LORD appeared to him the same night and said,\n“I am the God of Abraham your father;\nDo not be afraid, for I am with you.\nI will bless and favor you, and multiply your descendants,\nFor the sake of My servant Abraham.”\n25 So Isaac built an altar there and called on the name of the LORD [in prayer]. He pitched his tent there; and there Isaac’s servants dug a well.\nCovenant with Abimelech 26 Then Abimelech came to him from Gerar with Ahuzzath, his [close friend and confidential] adviser, and Phicol, the commander of his army. 27 Isaac said to them, “Why have you [people] come to me, since you hate me and have sent me away from you?” 28 They said, “We see clearly that the LORD has been with you; so we said, ‘There should now be an oath between us [with a curse for the one who breaks it], that is, between you and us, and let us make a covenant (binding agreement, solemn promise) with you, 29 that you will not harm us, just as we have not touched you and have done nothing but good to you and have sent you away in peace. You are now the blessed and favored of the LORD!’” 30 Then Isaac held a [formal] banquet (covenant feast) for them, and they ate and drank. 31 They got up early in the morning and swore oaths [pledging to do nothing but good to each other]; and Isaac sent them on their way and they left him in peace. 32 Now on the same day, Isaac’s servants came and told him about the well they had dug, saying, “We have found water.” 33 So he named the well Shibah; therefore the name of the city is Beersheba to this day.\n\n34 When Esau was forty years old he married Judith the daughter of Beeri the Hittite, and Basemath the daughter of Elon the Hittite as his wives; 35 and they were a source of grief to [Esau’s parents] Isaac and Rebekah.\n\nGenesis 27\nJacob’s Deception\n\n1 Now when Isaac was old and his eyes were too dim to see, he called his elder [and favorite] son Esau and said to him, “My son.” And Esau answered him, “Here I am.” 2 Isaac said, “See here, I am old; I do not know when I may die. 3 So now, please take your [hunting] gear, your quiver [of arrows] and your bow, and go out into the open country and hunt game for me; 4 and make me a savory and delicious dish [of meat], the kind I love, and bring it to me to eat, so that my soul may bless you [as my firstborn son] before I die.”\n5 But Rebekah overheard what Isaac said to Esau his son; and when Esau had gone to the open country to hunt for game that he might bring back, 6 Rebekah said to Jacob her [younger and favorite] son, “Listen carefully: I heard your father saying to Esau your brother, 7 ‘Bring me some game and make me a savory and delicious dish [of meat], so that I may eat it, and declare my blessing on you in the presence of the LORD before my death.’ 8 So now, my son, listen [carefully] to me [and do exactly] as I command you. 9 Go now to the flock and bring me two good and suitable young goats, and I will make them into a savory dish [of meat] for your father, the kind he loves [to eat]. 10 “Then you shall bring it to your father to eat, so that he may bless you before his death.” 11 Jacob said to Rebekah his mother, “Listen, Esau my brother is a hairy man and I am a smooth [skinned] man. 12 “Suppose my father touches me and feels my skin; then I will be seen by him as a cheat (imposter), and I will bring his curse on me and not a blessing.” 13 But his mother said to him, “May your curse be on me, my son; only listen and obey me, and go, bring the young goats to me.” 14 So Jacob went and got the two young goats, and brought them to his mother; and his mother prepared a delicious dish of food [with a delightful aroma], the kind his father loved [to eat]. 15 Then Rebekah took her elder son Esau’s best clothes, which were with her in her house, and put them on Jacob her younger son. 16 And she put the skins of the young goats on his hands and on the smooth part of his neck. 17 Then she gave her son Jacob the delicious meat and the bread which she had prepared.\n18 So he went to his father and said, “My father.” And Isaac said, “Here I am. Who are you, my son?” 19 Jacob said to his father, “I am Esau your firstborn; I have done what you told me to do. Now please, sit up and eat some of my game, so that you may bless me.” 20 Isaac said to his son, “How is it that you have found the game so quickly, my son?” And he said, “Because the LORD your God caused it to come to me.” 21 But Isaac [wondered and] said to Jacob, “Please come close [to me] so that I may touch you, my son, and determine if you are really my son Esau or not.” 22 So Jacob approached Isaac, and his father touched him and said, “The voice is Jacob’s voice, but the hands are the hands of Esau.” 23 He could not recognize him [as Jacob], because his hands were hairy like his brother Esau’s hands; so he blessed him. 24 But he said, “Are you really my son Esau?” Jacob answered, “I am.” 25 Then Isaac said, “Bring the food to me, and I will eat some of my son’s game, so that I may bless you.” He brought it to him, and he ate; and he brought him wine and he drank. 26 Then his father Isaac said to him, “Please come, my son, and kiss me.” 27 So he came and kissed him; and Isaac smelled his clothing and blessed him and said,\n“The scent of my son [Esau]\nIs like the aroma of a field which the LORD has blessed;\n28 Now may God give you of the dew of heaven [to water your land],\nAnd of the fatness (fertility) of the earth,\nAnd an abundance of grain and new wine;\n29 May peoples serve you,\nAnd nations bow down to you;\nBe lord and master over your brothers,\nAnd may your mother’s sons bow down to you.\nMay those who curse you be cursed,\nAnd may those who bless you be blessed.”\nThe Stolen Blessing 30 Now as soon as Isaac had finished blessing Jacob, and Jacob had scarcely left the presence of Isaac his father, Esau his brother came in from his hunting. 31 Esau also made a delicious dish [of meat] and brought it to his father and said to him, “Let my father get up and eat some of his son’s game, so that you may bless me.” 32 Isaac his father said to him, “Who are you?” And he replied, “I am your son, your firstborn, Esau.” 33 Then Isaac trembled violently, and he said, “Then who was the one [who was just here] who hunted game and brought it to me? I ate all of it before you came, and I blessed him. Yes, and he [in fact] shall be (shall remain) blessed.” 34 When Esau heard the words of his father, he cried out with a great and extremely bitter cry and said to his father, “Bless me, even me also, O my father!” 35 Isaac said, “Your brother came deceitfully and has [fraudulently] taken away your blessing [for himself].” 36 Esau replied, “Is he not rightly named Jacob (the supplanter)? For he has supplanted me these two times: he took away my birthright, and now he has taken away my blessing. Have you not reserved a blessing for me?” 37 But Isaac replied to Esau, “Listen carefully: I have made Jacob your lord and master; I have given him all his brothers and relatives as servants; and I have sustained him with grain and new wine. What then, can I do for you, my son?” 38 Esau said to his father, “Have you only one blessing, my father? Bless me, even me also, O my father.” Then Esau [no longer able to restrain himself] raised his voice and wept [loudly].\n39 Then Isaac his father answered and [prophesied and] said to him,\n“Your dwelling shall be away from the fertility of the earth\nAnd away from the dew of heaven above;\n40 But you shall live by your sword,\nAnd serve your brother;\nHowever it shall come to pass when you break loose [from your anger and hatred],\nThat you will tear his yoke off your neck [and you will be free of him].”\n41 So Esau hated Jacob because of the blessing with which his father blessed him; and Esau said in his heart, “The days of mourning for my father are very near; then I will kill my brother Jacob.” 42 When these words of her elder son Esau were repeated to Rebekah, she sent for Jacob her younger son, and said to him, “Listen carefully, your brother Esau is comforting himself concerning you by planning to kill you. 43 So now, my son, listen and do what I say; go, escape to my brother Laban in Haran! 44 Stay with him for a while, until your brother’s anger subsides. 45 “When your brother’s anger toward you subsides and he forgets what you did to him, then I will send and bring you back from there. Why should I be deprived of you both in a single day?”\n46 Then Rebekah said to Isaac, “I am tired of living because of the daughters of Heth [these insolent wives of Esau]. If Jacob takes a wife from the daughters of Heth, like these daughters of the land, what good will my life be to me?”\n\nGenesis 28\nJacob Is Sent Away\n\n1 So Isaac called Jacob and blessed him and charged him, and said to him, “You shall not marry one of the women of Canaan. 2 Arise, go to Paddan-aram, to the house of Bethuel your mother’s father; and take from there as a wife for yourself one of the daughters of Laban your mother’s brother. 3 May God Almighty bless you and make you fruitful and multiply you, so that you may become a [great] company of peoples. 4 “May He also give the blessing of Abraham to you and your descendants with you, that you may inherit the [promised] land of your sojournings, which He gave to Abraham.” 5 Then Isaac sent Jacob away, and he went to Paddan-aram, to Laban, son of Bethuel the Aramean, the brother of Rebekah, the mother of Jacob and Esau.\n6 Now Esau noticed that Isaac had blessed Jacob and sent him to Paddan-aram to take a wife for himself from there, and that as he blessed him he gave him a prohibition, saying, “You shall not take a wife from the daughters of Canaan,” 7 and that Jacob obeyed his father and his mother and had gone to Paddan-aram. 8 So Esau realized that [his two wives] the daughters of Canaan displeased Isaac his father; 9 and [to appease his parents] Esau went to [the family of] Ishmael and took as his wife, in addition to the wives he [already] had, Mahalath the daughter of Ishmael, Abraham’s son, the sister of Nebaioth [Ishmael’s firstborn son].\nJacob’s Dream 10 Now Jacob left Beersheba [never to see his mother again] and traveled toward Haran. 11 And he came to a certain place and stayed overnight there because the sun had set. Taking one of the stones of the place, he put it under his head and lay down there [to sleep]. 12 He dreamed that there was a ladder (stairway) placed on the earth, and the top of it reached [out of sight] toward heaven; and [he saw] the angels of God ascending and descending on it [going to and from heaven]. 13 And behold, the LORD stood above and around him and said, “I am the LORD, the God of Abraham your [father’s] father and the God of Isaac; I will give to you and to your descendants the land [of promise] on which you are lying. 14 Your descendants shall be as [countless as] the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west and the east and the north and the south; and all the families (nations) of the earth shall be blessed through you and your descendants. 15 “Behold, I am with you and will keep [careful watch over you and guard] you wherever you may go, and I will bring you back to this [promised] land; for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.” 16 Then Jacob awoke from his sleep and he said, “Without any doubt the LORD is in this place, and I did not realize it.” 17 So he was afraid and said, “How fearful and awesome is this place! This is none other than the house of God, and this is the gateway to heaven.”\n18 So Jacob got up early in the morning, and took the stone he had put under his head and he set it up as a pillar [that is, a monument to the vision in his dream], and he poured [olive] oil on the top of it [to consecrate it]. 19 He named that place Bethel (the house of God); the previous name of that city was Luz (Almond Tree). 20 Then Jacob made a vow (promise), saying, “If God will be with me and will keep me on this journey that I take, and will give me food to eat and clothing to wear, 21 and if [He grants that] I return to my father’s house in safety, then the LORD will be my God. 22 “This stone which I have set up as a pillar (monument, memorial) will be God’s house [a sacred place to me], and of everything that You give me I will give the tenth to You [as an offering to signify my gratitude and dependence on You].”\n\nGenesis 29\nJacob Meets Rachel\n\n1 Then Jacob went on his way and came to the land of the people of the East [near Haran]. 2 As he looked, he saw a well in the field, and three flocks of sheep lying there [resting] beside it because the flocks were watered from that well. Now the stone on the mouth of the well [that covered and protected it] was large, 3 and when all the flocks were gathered there, the shepherds would roll the stone from the mouth of the well, water the sheep, and [afterward] replace the stone on the mouth of the well.\n4 Jacob said to them, “My brothers, where are you from?” And they said, “We are from Haran.” 5 So he said to them, “Do you know Laban the grandson of Nahor [Abraham’s brother]?” And they replied, “We know him.” 6 And he asked them, “Is it well with him?” And they said, “He is doing well; look, here comes his daughter Rachel with the sheep!” 7 Jacob said, “Look, the sun is still high [overhead]; it is a long time before the flocks need to be gathered [in their folds for the night]. Water the sheep, and go, and return them to their pasture.” 8 But they said, “We cannot [leave] until all the flocks are gathered together, and the shepherds roll the stone from the mouth of the well; then we will water the sheep.”\n9 While he was still speaking with them, Rachel came with her father’s sheep, for she was a shepherdess. 10 When Jacob saw [his cousin] Rachel, the daughter of Laban, his mother’s brother, and Laban’s sheep, he came up and rolled the stone away from the mouth of the well and watered the flock of Laban, his uncle. 11 Then Jacob kissed Rachel [in greeting], and he raised his voice and wept. 12 Jacob told Rachel he was her father’s relative, Rebekah’s son; and she ran and told her father.\n13 When Laban heard of the arrival of Jacob, his sister’s son, he ran to meet him, and embraced and kissed him and brought him to his house. Then he told Laban all these things. 14 Then Laban said to him, “You are my bone and my flesh.” And Jacob stayed with him a month.\n15 Then Laban said to Jacob, “Just because you are my relative, should you work for me for nothing? Tell me, what should your wages be?” 16 Now Laban had two daughters; the name of the older was Leah, and the name of the younger was Rachel. 17 Leah’s eyes were weak, but Rachel was beautiful in form and appearance. 18 Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, “I will serve you [as a hired workman] for seven years [in return] for [the privilege of marrying] Rachel your younger daughter.” 19 Laban said, “It is better that I give her [in marriage] to you than give her to another man. Stay and work with me.” 20 So Jacob served [Laban] for seven years for [the right to marry] Rachel, but they seemed like only a few days to him because of his love for her.\n\nLaban’s Treachery 21 Finally, Jacob said to Laban, “Give me my wife, for my time [of service] is completed, so that I may take her to me [as my wife].” 22 So Laban gathered together all the men of the place and prepared a [wedding] feast [with wine]. 23 But in the evening he took Leah his daughter and brought her to Jacob, and Jacob went in to [consummate the marriage with] her. 24 Laban also gave Zilpah his maid to his daughter Leah as a maid. 25 But in the morning [when Jacob awoke], it was Leah [who was with him]! And he said to Laban, “What is this that you have done to me? Did I not work for you [for seven years] for Rachel? Why have you deceived and betrayed me [like this]?” 26 But Laban only said, “It is not the tradition here to give the younger [daughter in marriage] before the older. 27 “Finish the week [of the wedding feast] for Leah; then we will give you Rachel also, and in return you shall work for me for seven more years.” 28 So Jacob complied and fulfilled Leah’s week [of celebration]; then Laban gave him his daughter Rachel as his [second] wife. 29 Laban also gave Bilhah his maid to his daughter Rachel as a maid. 30 So Jacob consummated his marriage and lived with Rachel [as his wife], and he loved Rachel more than Leah, and he served with Laban for another seven years.\n31 Now when the LORD saw that Leah was unloved, He made her able to bear children, but Rachel was barren. 32 Leah conceived and gave birth to a son and named him Reuben (See, a son!), for she said, “Because the LORD has seen my humiliation and suffering; now my husband will love me [since I have given him a son].” 33 Then she conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, “Because the LORD heard that I am unloved, He has given me this son also.” So she named him Simeon (God hears). 34 She conceived again and gave birth to a son and said, “Now this time my husband will become attached to me [as a companion], for I have given him three sons.” Therefore he was named Levi. 35 Again she conceived and gave birth to a [fourth] son, and she said, “Now I will praise the LORD.” So she named him Judah; then [for a time] she stopped bearing [children].\n\nGenesis 30\nThe Sons Of Jacob\n\n1 When Rachel saw that she conceived no children for Jacob, she envied her sister, and said to Jacob, “Give me children, or else I will die.” 2 Then Jacob became furious with Rachel, and he said, “Am I in the place of God, who has denied you children?” 3 She said, “Here, take my maid Bilhah and go in to her; and [when the baby comes] she shall deliver it [while sitting] on my knees, so that by her I may also have children [to count as my own].” 4 So she gave him Bilhah her maid as a [secondary] wife, and Jacob went in to her. 5 Bilhah conceived and gave birth to a son for Jacob. 6 Then Rachel said, “God has judged and vindicated me, and has heard my plea and has given me a son [through my maid].” So she named him Dan (He judged). 7 Bilhah, Rachel’s maid, conceived again and gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 8 So Rachel said, “With mighty wrestlings [in prayer to God] I have struggled with my sister and have prevailed.” So she named him Naphtali (my wrestlings).\n9 When Leah saw that she had stopped bearing [children], she took Zilpah her maid and gave her to Jacob as a [secondary] wife. 10 Zilpah, Leah’s maid, gave birth to a son for Jacob. 11 Then Leah said, “How fortunate!” So she named him Gad (good fortune). 12 Zilpah, Leah’s maid, gave birth to a second son for Jacob. 13 Then Leah said, “I am happy! For women will call me happy.” So she named him Asher (happy).\n14 Now at the time of wheat harvest Reuben [the eldest child] went and found some mandrakes in the field, and brought them to his mother Leah. Then Rachel said to Leah, “Please give me some of your son’s mandrakes.” 15 But Leah answered, “Is it a small thing that you have taken my husband? Would you take away my son’s mandrakes also?” So Rachel said, “Jacob shall sleep with you tonight in exchange for your son’s mandrakes.” 16 When Jacob came in from the field in the evening, Leah went out to meet him and said, “You must sleep with me [tonight], for I have in fact hired you with my son’s mandrakes.” So he slept with her that night. 17 God listened and answered [the prayer of] Leah, and she conceived and gave birth to a fifth son for Jacob. 18 Then Leah said, “God has given me my reward because I have given my maid to my husband.” So she named him Issachar. 19 Leah conceived again and gave birth to a sixth son for Jacob. 20 Then Leah said, “God has endowed me with a good [marriage] gift [for my husband]; now he will live with me [regarding me with honor as his wife], because I have given birth to six sons.” So she named him Zebulun. 21 Afterward she gave birth to a daughter and named her Dinah.\n22 Then God remembered [the prayers of] Rachel, and God thought of her and opened her womb [so that she would conceive]. 23 So she conceived and gave birth to a son; and she said, “God has taken away my disgrace and humiliation.” 24 She named him Joseph (may He add) and said, “May the LORD add to me another son.”\nJacob Prospers 25 Now when Rachel had given birth to Joseph, Jacob said to Laban, “Send me away, that I may go back to my own place and to my own country. 26 “Give me my wives and my children for whom I have served you, and let me go; for you know the work which I have done for you.” 27 But Laban said to him, “If I have found favor in your sight, stay with me; for I have learned [from the omens in divination and by experience] that the LORD has blessed me because of you.” 28 He said, “Name your wages, and I will give it [to you].” 29 Jacob answered him, “You know how I have served you and how your possessions, your cattle and sheep and goats, have fared with me. 30 “For you had little before I came and it has increased and multiplied abundantly, and the LORD has favored you with blessings wherever I turned. But now, when shall I provide for my own household?” 31 Laban asked, “What shall I give you?” Jacob replied, “You shall not give me anything. But if you will do this one thing for me [which I now propose], I will again pasture and keep your flock: 32 Let me pass through your entire flock today, removing from it every speckled and spotted sheep and every dark or black one among the lambs and the spotted and speckled among the goats; and those shall be my wages. 33 “So my honesty will be evident for me later, when you come [for an accounting] concerning my wages. Every one that is not speckled and spotted among the goats and dark among the young lambs, if found with me, shall be considered stolen.” 34 And Laban said, “Good! Let it be done as you say.” 35 So on that same day Laban [secretly] removed the male goats that were streaked and spotted and all the female goats that were speckled and spotted, every one with white on it, and all the dark ones among the sheep, and put them in the care of his sons. 36 And he put [a distance of] three days’ journey between himself and Jacob, and Jacob was then left in care of the rest of Laban’s flock.\n37 Then Jacob took branches of fresh poplar and almond and plane trees, and peeled white stripes in them, exposing the white in the branches. 38 Then he set the branches which he had peeled in front of the flocks in the watering troughs, where the flocks came to drink; and they mated and conceived when they came to drink. 39 So the flocks mated and conceived by the branches, and the flocks gave birth to streaked, speckled, and spotted offspring. 40 Jacob separated the lambs, and [as he had done with the peeled branches] he made the flocks face toward the streaked and all the dark or black in the [new] flock of Laban; and he put his own herds apart by themselves and did not put them [where they could breed] with Laban’s flock. 41 Furthermore, whenever the stronger [animals] of the flocks were breeding, Jacob would place the branches in the sight of the flock in the watering troughs, so that they would mate and conceive among the branches; 42 but when the flock was sickly, he did not put the branches there; so the sicker [animals] were Laban’s and the stronger Jacob’s. 43 So Jacob became exceedingly prosperous, and had large flocks [of sheep and goats], and female and male servants, and camels and donkeys.\n\nGenesis 31\nJacob Leaves Secretly For Canaan\n\n1 Jacob heard that Laban’s sons were saying: “Jacob has taken away everything that was our father’s, and from what belonged to our father he has acquired all this wealth and honor.” 2J acob noticed [a change in] the attitude of Laban, and saw that it was not friendly toward him as before. 3 Then the LORD said to Jacob, “Return to the land of your fathers and to your people, and I will be with you.” 4 So Jacob sent and called Rachel and Leah to his flock in the field, 5 and he said to them, “I see [a change in] your father’s attitude, that he is not friendly toward me as [he was] before; but the God of my father [Isaac] has been with me. 6 You know that I have served your father with all my strength. 7 Yet your father has cheated me [as often as possible] and changed my wages ten times; but God did not allow him to hurt me. 8 If he said, ‘The speckled shall be your wages,’ then the entire flock gave birth to speckled [young]; and if he said, ‘The streaked shall be your wages,’ then the entire flock gave birth to streaked [young]. 9 Thus God has taken away the flocks of your father and given them to me. 10 And it happened at the time when the flock conceived that I looked up and saw in a dream that the rams which mated [with the female goats] were streaked, speckled, and spotted. 11 And the Angel of God said to me in the dream, ‘Jacob.’ And I said, ‘Here I am.’ 12 He said, ‘Look up and see, all the rams which are mating [with the flock] are streaked, speckled, and spotted; for I have seen all that Laban has been doing to you. 1 3‘I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed the pillar, and where you made a vow to Me; now stand up, leave this land, and return to the land of your birth.’” 14 Rachel and Leah answered him, “Is there still any portion or inheritance for us in our father’s house? 15 Are we not counted by him as foreigners? For he sold us [to you in marriage], and has also entirely used up our purchase price. 16 “Surely all the riches which God has taken from our father are ours and our children’s. Now then, whatever God has told you to do, do it.”\n17 Then Jacob stood [and took action] and put his children and his wives on camels; 18 and he drove away all his livestock and [took along] all his property which he had acquired, the livestock he had obtained and accumulated in Paddan-aram, to go to his father Isaac in the land of Canaan. 19 When Laban had gone to shear his sheep, Rachel [went inside the house and] stole her father’s household gods. 20 And Jacob deceived Laban the Aramean (Syrian) by not telling him that he intended to leave and he slipped away secretly. 21 So he fled with everything that he had, and got up and crossed the river [Euphrates], and set his face toward the hill country of Gilead [east of the Jordan River].\nLaban Pursues Jacob 22 On the third day [after his departure] Laban was told that Jacob had fled. 23 So he took his relatives with him and pursued him for seven days, and they overtook him in the hill country of Gilead. 24 God came to Laban the Aramean in a dream at night and said to him, “Be careful that you do not speak to Jacob, either good or bad.”\n25 Then Laban overtook Jacob. Now Jacob had pitched his tent on the hill, and Laban with his relatives camped on the same hill of Gilead. 26 Then Laban said to Jacob, “What do you mean by deceiving me and leaving without my knowledge, and carrying off my daughters as if [they were] captives of the sword? 27 Why did you run away secretly and deceive me and not tell me, so that [otherwise] I might have sent you away with joy and with songs, with [music on the] tambourine and lyre? 28 And why did you not allow me to kiss my grandchildren and my daughters [goodbye]? Now you have done a foolish thing [in behaving like this]. 29 It is in my power to harm you, but the God of your father spoke to me last night, saying, ‘Be careful not to speak to Jacob, either good or bad.’ 30 “Now [I suppose] you felt you must go because you were homesick for your father’s house and family; but why did you steal my [household] gods?” 31 Jacob answered Laban, “[I left secretly] because I was afraid, for I thought you would take your daughters away from me by force. 32 “The one with whom you find your gods shall not live; in the presence of our relatives [search my possessions and] point out whatever you find that belongs to you and take it.” For Jacob did not know that Rachel had stolen the idols.\n\n33 So Laban went into Jacob’s tent and into Leah’s tent and the tent of the two maids, but he did not find them. Then he came out of Leah’s tent and entered Rachel’s tent. 34 Now Rachel had taken the household idols and put them in the camel’s saddlebag and sat on them. Laban searched through all her tent, but did not find them. 35 So Rachel said to her father, “Do not be displeased, my lord, that I cannot rise before you, for the manner of women is on me and I am unwell.” He searched [further] but did not find the household idols.\n36 Then Jacob became angry and argued with Laban. And he said to Laban, “What is my fault? What is my sin that you pursued me like this? 37 Although you have searched through all my possessions, what have you found of your household goods? Put it here before my relatives and your relatives, so that they may decide [who has done right] between the two of us. 38 These twenty years I have been with you; your ewes and your female goats have not lost their young, nor have I eaten the rams of your flocks. 39 I did not bring you the torn carcasses [of the animals attacked by predators]; I [personally] took the loss. You required of me [to make good] everything that was stolen, whether it occurred by day or night. 40 This was my situation: by day the heat consumed me and by night the cold, and I could not sleep. 41 These twenty years I have been in your house; I served you fourteen years for your two daughters and six years for [my share of] your flocks, and you have changed my wages ten times. 42 “If the God of my father, the God of Abraham, and [the Feared One] of Isaac, had not been with me, most certainly you would have sent me away now empty-handed. God has seen my affliction and humiliation and the [exhausting] labor of my hands, so He rendered judgment and rebuked you last night.”\nThe Covenant of Mizpah 43 Laban answered Jacob, “These women [that you married] are my daughters, these children are my grandchildren, these flocks are [from] my flocks, and all that you see [here] is mine. But what can I do today to these my daughters or to their children to whom they have given birth? 44 “So come now, let us make a covenant, you and I, and let it serve as a witness between you and me.” 45 So Jacob took a stone and set it up as a [memorial] pillar. 46 Jacob said to his relatives, “Gather stones.” And they took stones and made a mound [of stones], and they ate [a ceremonial meal together] there on the mound [of stones]. 47 Laban called it Jegar-sahadutha (stone monument of testimony in Aramaic), but Jacob called it Galeed. 48 Laban said, “This mound [of stones] is a witness [a reminder of the oath taken] today between you and me.” Therefore he [also] called the name Galeed, 49 and Mizpah (watchtower), for Laban said, “May the LORD watch between you and me when we are absent from one another. 50 “If you should mistreat (humiliate, oppress) my daughters, or if you should take other wives besides my daughters, although no one is with us [as a witness], see and remember, God is witness between you and me.” 51 Laban said to Jacob, “Look at this mound [of stones] and look at this pillar which I have set up between you and me. 52 This mound is a witness, and this pillar is a witness, that I will not pass by this mound to harm you, and that you will not pass by this mound and this pillar to harm me. 53 “The God of Abraham [your father] and the God of Nahor [my father], and the god [the image of worship] of their father [Terah, an idolater], judge between us.” But Jacob swore [only] by [the one true God] the Fear of his father Isaac. 54 Then Jacob offered a sacrifice [to the LORD] on the mountain, and called his relatives to the meal; and they ate food and spent the night on the mountain. 55 Early in the morning Laban got up and kissed his grandchildren and his daughters [goodbye] and pronounced a blessing [asking God’s favor] on them. Then Laban left and returned home.\n\nGenesis 32\nJacob’s Fear Of Esau\n\n1 Then as Jacob went on his way, the angels of God met him [to reassure and protect him]. 2 When Jacob saw them, he said, “This is God’s camp.” So he named that place Mahanaim (double camps).\n3 Then Jacob sent messengers ahead of him to his brother Esau in the land of Seir, the country of Edom. 4 He commanded them, saying, “This is what to say to my lord Esau: ‘Your servant Jacob says this, “I have been living temporarily with Laban, and have stayed there until now; 5 I have oxen, donkeys, flocks, male servants, and female servants; and I have sent [this message] to tell my lord, so that I may find grace and kindness in your sight.”’”\n6 The messengers returned to Jacob, saying, “We went to your brother Esau, and now he is coming to meet you, and there are four hundred men with him.” 7 Jacob was greatly afraid and distressed; and he divided the people who were with him, and the flocks and herds and camels, into two camps; 8 and he said, “If Esau comes to the one camp and attacks it, then the other camp which is left will escape.”\n9 Jacob said, “O God of my father Abraham and God of my father Isaac, the LORD, who said to me, ‘Return to your country and to your people, and I will make you prosper,’ 10 I am unworthy of all the lovingkindness and compassion and of all the faithfulness which You have shown to Your servant. With only my staff [long ago] I crossed over this Jordan, and now I have become [blessed and increased into these] two groups [of people]. 11 Save me, please, from the hand of my brother, from the hand of Esau; for I fear him, that he will come and attack me and the mothers with the children. 12 “And You [LORD] said, ‘I will certainly make you prosper and make your descendants as [numerous as] the sand of the sea, which is too great to be counted.’”\n13 So Jacob spent the night there. Then he selected a present for his brother Esau from the livestock he had acquired: 14 two hundred female goats, twenty male goats, two hundred ewes, twenty rams, 15 thirty milking camels with their colts, forty cows, ten bulls, twenty female donkeys, and ten [donkey] colts. 16 He put them into the care of his servants, every herd by itself, and said to his servants, “Go on ahead of me, and put an interval [of space] between the individual herds.” 17 Then he commanded the one in front, saying, “When Esau my brother meets you and asks to whom you belong, and where you are going, and whose are the animals in front of you? 18 then you shall say, ‘They are your servant Jacob’s; they are a gift sent to my lord Esau. And he also is behind us.’” 19 And so Jacob commanded the second and the third as well, and all that followed the herds, saying, “This is what you shall say to Esau when you meet him; 20 and you shall say, ‘Look, your servant Jacob is behind us.’” For he said [to himself], “I will try to appease him with the gift that is going ahead of me. Then afterward I will see him; perhaps he will accept and forgive me.” 21 So the gift [of the herds of livestock] went on ahead of him, and he himself spent that night back in the camp.\n22 But he got up that same night and took his two wives, his two female servants, and his eleven children, and waded over the ford of the Jabbok. 23 Then he took them and sent them across the brook. And he also sent across whatever he had. Jacob Wrestles 24 So Jacob was left alone, and a Man [came and] wrestled with him until daybreak. 25 When the Man saw that He had not prevailed against Jacob, He touched his hip joint; and Jacob’s hip was dislocated as he wrestled with Him. 26 Then He said, “Let Me go, for day is breaking.” But Jacob said, “I will not let You go unless You declare a blessing on me.” 27 So He asked him, “What is your name?” And he said, “Jacob.” 28 And He said, “Your name shall no longer be Jacob, but Israel; for you have struggled with God and with men and have prevailed.” 29 Then Jacob asked Him, “Please tell me Your name.” But He said, “Why is it that you ask My name?” And He declared a blessing [of the covenant promises] on Jacob there. 30 So Jacob named the place Peniel (the face of God), saying, “For I have seen God face to face, yet my life has not been snatched away.” 31 Now the sun rose on him as he passed Penuel (Peniel), and he was limping because of his hip. 32 Therefore, to this day the Israelites do not eat the tendon of the hip which is on the socket of the thigh, because He touched the socket of Jacob’s thigh by the tendon of the hip.\n\nGenesis 33\nJacob Meets Esau\n\n1 Then Jacob looked up, and saw Esau coming with four hundred men. So he divided the children among Leah and Rachel and the two maids. 2 He put the maids and their children in front, Leah and her children after them, and Rachel and Joseph last of all. 3 Then Jacob crossed over [the stream] ahead of them and bowed himself to the ground seven times [bowing and moving forward each time], until he approached his brother.\n4 But Esau ran to meet him and embraced him, and hugged his neck and kissed him, and they wept [for joy]. 5 Esau looked up and saw the women and the children, and said, “Who are these with you?” So Jacob replied, “They are the children whom God has graciously given your servant.” 6 Then the maids approached with their children, and they bowed down. 7 Leah also approached with her children, and they bowed down. Afterward Joseph and Rachel approached, and they bowed down. 8 Esau asked, “What do you mean by all this company which I have met?” And he answered, “[These are] to find favor in the sight of my lord.” 9 But Esau said, “I have plenty, my brother; keep what you have for yourself.” 10 Jacob replied, “No, please, if now I have found favor in your sight, then accept my gift [as a blessing] from my hand, for I see your face as if I had seen the face of God, and you have received me favorably. 11 “Please accept my blessing (gift) which has been brought to you, for God has dealt graciously with me and I have everything [that I could possibly want].” So Jacob kept urging him and Esau accepted it.\n12 Then Esau said, “Let us get started on our journey and I will go in front of you [to lead the way].” 13 But Jacob replied, “You know, my lord, that the children are frail and need gentle care, and the nursing flocks and herds [with young] are of concern to me; for if the men should drive them hard for a single day, all the flocks will die. 14 “Please let my lord go on ahead of his servant, and I will move on slowly, governed by the pace of the livestock that are in front of me and according to the endurance of the children, until I come to my lord in Seir [in Edom].”\n15 Then Esau said, “Please let me leave with you some of the people who are with me.” But Jacob said, “What need is there [for it]? Let me find favor in the sight of my lord.” 16 So Esau turned back [toward the south] that day on his way to Seir. 17 But Jacob journeyed [north] to Succoth, and built himself a house and made shelters for his livestock; so the name of the place is Succoth (huts, shelters).\nJacob Settles in Shechem 18 When Jacob came from Paddan-aram, he arrived safely and in peace at the city of Shechem, in the land of Canaan, and camped in front of the [walled] city. 19 Then he bought the piece of land on which he had pitched his tents from the sons of Hamor, Shechem’s father, for a hundred pieces of money. 20 There he erected an altar and called it El-Elohe-Israel.\n\nGenesis 34\nThe Treachery Of Jacob’s Sons\n\n1 Now Dinah the daughter of Leah, whom she had borne to Jacob, went out [unescorted] to visit the girls of the land. 2 When Shechem the son of Hamor the Hivite, prince (sheik) of the land, saw her, he kidnapped her and lay [intimately] with her by force [humbling and offending her]. 3 But his soul longed for and clung to Dinah daughter of Jacob, and he loved the girl and spoke comfortingly to her young heart’s wishes. 4 So Shechem said to his father Hamor, “Get me this young woman as a wife.” 5 Now Jacob heard that Shechem had defiled (violated) Dinah his daughter; but his sons were in the field with his livestock, so Jacob said nothing until they came in. 6 But Shechem’s father Hamor went to Jacob to talk with him. 7 Now when Jacob’s sons heard of it they came in from the field; they were deeply grieved, and they were very angry, for Shechem had done a disgraceful thing to Israel by lying with Jacob’s daughter, for such a thing is not to be done.\n8 But Hamor conferred with them, saying, “The soul of my son Shechem [deeply] longs for your daughter [and sister]. Please give her to him as his wife. 9 And [beyond that] intermarry with us; give your daughters to us [as wives] and take our daughters for yourselves. 10 “In this way you shall live with us; the country will be open to you; live and do business in it and acquire property and possessions in it.” 11 Shechem also said to Dinah’s father and to her brothers, “Let me find favor in your sight, and I will give you whatever you ask of me. 12 “Demand of me a very large bridal payment and gift [as compensation for giving up your daughter and sister], and I will give you whatever you tell me; only give me the girl to be my wife.”\n13 Jacob’s sons answered Shechem and Hamor his father deceitfully, because Shechem had defiled and disgraced their sister Dinah. 14 They said to them, “We cannot do this thing and give our sister [in marriage] to one who is not circumcised, because that would be a disgrace to us. 15 But we will consent to you only on this condition: if you will become like us, in that every male among you consents to be circumcised, 16 then we will give our daughters to you [in marriage], and we will take your daughters for ourselves, and we will live with you and become one people. 17 “But if you do not listen to us and refuse to be circumcised, then we will take our daughter [Dinah] and go.”\n18 Their words seemed reasonable to Hamor and his son Shechem, 19 and the young man did not hesitate to do the [required] thing, for he was delighted with Jacob’s daughter. Now he was more respected and honored than all [others] in the household of his father. 20 Then Hamor and Shechem his son came to the gate of their [walled] city [where the leading men would meet] and spoke with the men of the city, saying, 21 “These men are peaceful and friendly with us; so let them live in the land and do business in it, for the land is large enough [for us and] for them; let us take their daughters for wives and let us give them our daughters [in marriage]. 22 But only on this condition will the men consent to our request that they live among us and become one people: that every male among us become circumcised just as they are circumcised. 23 “Will not their cattle and their possessions and all their animals be ours [if we do this]? Let us consent [to do as they ask], and they will live here with us.” 24 And every [Canaanite] man who went out of the city gate listened and considered what Hamor and Shechem said; and every male who was a resident of that city was circumcised.\n25 Now on the third day [after the circumcision], when all the men were [terribly] sore and in pain, two of Jacob’s sons, Simeon and Levi, Dinah’s [full] brothers, took their swords, boldly entered the city [without anyone suspecting them of evil intent], and they killed every male. 26 They killed Hamor and his son Shechem with the edge of the sword, and took Dinah out of Shechem’s house [where she was staying], and left. 27 Then Jacob’s [other] sons came upon those who were killed and looted the town, because their sister had been defiled and disgraced. 28 They took the Canaanites’ flocks and their herds and their donkeys, and whatever was in the city and in the field; 29 they looted all their wealth, and [took captive] all their children and their wives, even everything that was in the houses. 30 Then Jacob said to Simeon and Levi, “You have ruined me, making me a stench to the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites and the Perizzites! My men are few in number, and the men of the land will band together against me and attack me; I shall be destroyed, I and my household.” 31 But they said, “Should he [be permitted to] treat our sister as a prostitute?”\n\nGenesis 35\nJacob Moves To Bethel\n\n1 Then God said to Jacob, “Go up to Bethel and live there, and make an altar there to God, who appeared to you [in a distinct manifestation] when you fled [years ago] from Esau your brother.” 2 Then Jacob said to his household and to all who were with him, “Get rid of the [idols and images of] foreign gods that are among you, and ceremonially purify yourselves and change [into fresh] clothes; 3 then let us get up and go up to Bethel, and I will make an altar there to God, who answered me in the day of my distress and has been with me wherever I have gone.” 4 So they gave Jacob all the [idols and images of the] foreign gods they had and the rings which were in their ears [worn as charms against evil], and Jacob buried them under the oak tree near Shechem.\n5 As they journeyed, there was a great [supernatural] terror [sent from God] on the cities around them, and [for that reason] the Canaanites did not pursue the sons of Jacob. 6 So Jacob came to Luz (that is, Bethel), which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who were with him. 7 There he built an altar [to worship the LORD], and called the place El-bethel (God of the House of God), because there God had revealed Himself to him when he escaped from his brother. 8 Now Deborah, [who once was] Rebekah’s nurse, died and was buried below Bethel under the oak; and the name of it was called Allon-bacuth (Oak of Weeping).\nJacob Is Named Israel 9 Then God [in a visible manifestation] appeared to Jacob again when he came out of Paddan-aram, and declared a blessing on him. 10 Again God said to him,\n“Your name is Jacob;\nYou shall no longer be called Jacob,\nBut Israel shall be your name.”\nSo he was called Israel. 11 And God said to him,\n“I am God Almighty.\nBe fruitful and multiply;\nA nation and a company of nations shall come from you,\nAnd kings shall be born of your loins.\n12 “The land which I gave Abraham and Isaac\nI will give to you,\nand to your descendants after you I will give the land.”\n13 Then God ascended from Jacob in the place where He had spoken with him. 14 Jacob set up a pillar (memorial, monument) in the place where he had talked with God, a pillar of stone, and he poured a drink offering [of wine] on it; he also poured oil on it [to declare it sacred for God’s purpose]. 15 So Jacob named the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel (the House of God).\n16 Then they journeyed from Bethel; and when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath (Bethlehem), Rachel began to give birth and had difficulty and suffered severely. 17 When she was in hard labor the midwife said to her, “Do not be afraid; you now have another son.” 18 And as her soul was departing, (for she died), she named him Ben-oni (son of my sorrow); but his father called him Benjamin (son of the right hand). 19 So Rachel died and was buried on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem). 20 Jacob set a pillar (memorial, monument) on her grave; that is the pillar of Rachel’s grave to this day. 21 Then Israel (Jacob) journeyed on and pitched his tent on the other side of the tower of Eder [the lookout point used by shepherds].\n22 While Israel was living in that land, Reuben [his eldest son] went and lay with Bilhah his father’s concubine, and Israel heard about it.\nThe Sons of Israel 23 Now Jacob had twelve sons— 24 The sons of Leah: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn, then Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, and Zebulun; 25 and the sons of Rachel: Joseph and Benjamin; 26 and the sons of Bilhah, Rachel’s maid: Dan and Naphtali; 27 and the sons of Zilpah, Leah’s maid: Gad and Asher. These are the sons of Jacob born to him in Paddan-aram.\n28 Jacob came to Isaac his father at Mamre of Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), where Abraham and Isaac had lived temporarily.\n29 Now the days of Isaac were a hundred and eighty years. 30 Isaac’s spirit departed and he died and was gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death], an old man full of days (satisfied, fulfilled); his sons Esau and Jacob buried him [in the cave of Machpelah with his parents Abraham and Sarah].\n\nGenesis 36\nEsau Moves\n\n1 Now these are the records of the descendants of Esau, (that is, Edom).\n\n2 Esau took his [three] wives from the daughters of Canaan: Adah the daughter of Elon the Hittite, and Oholibamah the daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon the Hivite, 3 and Basemath, Ishmael’s daughter, sister of Nebaioth. 4 Adah bore Eliphaz to Esau, and Basemath bore Reuel, 5 and Oholibamah bore Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the sons of Esau born to him in Canaan.\n6 Now Esau took his wives and his sons and his daughters and all the members of his household, and his livestock and all his cattle and all his possessions which he had acquired in the land of Canaan, and he went to a land away from his brother Jacob. 7 For their [great flocks and herds and] possessions made it impossible for them to live together [in the same region]; the land in which they lived temporarily could not support them because of their livestock. 8 So Esau lived in the hill country of Seir; Esau is Edom.\nDescendants of Esau 9 These are the records of the generations of Esau the father of the Edomites in the hill country of Seir. 10 These are the names of Esau’s sons: Eliphaz, the son of Adah, Esau’s wife, and Reuel, the son of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 11 And the sons of Eliphaz were Teman, Omar, Zepho, Gatam, and Kenaz. 12 And Timna was a concubine of Eliphaz, Esau’s son; and she bore Amalek to Eliphaz. These are the sons of Adah, Esau’s wife. 13 These are the sons of Reuel: Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, and Mizzah. These are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 14 And these are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife, the daughter of Anah, the son of Zibeon. She bore to Esau: Jeush, Jalam, and Korah.\n15 These are the tribal chiefs of the sons of Esau: The sons of Eliphaz, the firstborn of Esau: Chiefs Teman, Omar, Zepho, Kenaz, 16 Korah, Gatam, and Amalek. These are the chiefs of Eliphaz in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Adah. 17 These are the sons of Reuel, Esau’s son: Chiefs Nahath, Zerah, Shammah, Mizzah. These are the chiefs of Reuel in the land of Edom; they are the sons of Basemath, Esau’s wife. 18 These are the sons of Oholibamah, Esau’s wife: Chiefs Jeush, Jalam, and Korah. These are the chiefs born of Oholibamah, daughter of Anah, Esau’s wife. 19 These are the sons of Esau, (that is, Edom), and these are their chiefs.\n\n20 These are the sons of Seir the Horite, the inhabitants of the land: Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 21 Dishon, Ezer, and Dishan. These are the chiefs of the Horites, the sons of Seir in the land of Edom. 22 The sons of Lotan are Hori and Hemam; and Lotan’s sister is Timna. 23 The sons of Shobal are these: Alvan, Manahath, Ebal, Shepho, and Onam. 24 These are the sons of Zibeon: Aiah and Anah. This is the Anah who found the hot springs in the wilderness as he pastured the donkeys of Zibeon his father. 25 The children of Anah are these: Dishon and Oholibamah [Esau’s wife], the daughter of Anah. 26 These are the sons of Dishon: Hemdan, Eshban, Ithran, and Cheran. 27 Ezer’s sons are these: Bilhan, Zaavan, and Akan. 28 The sons of Dishan are these: Uz and Aran. 29 The Horite chiefs are these: Chiefs Lotan, Shobal, Zibeon, Anah, 30 Dishon, Ezer, Dishan. These are the Horite chiefs, according to their various clans in the land of Seir.\n31 And these are the kings who reigned in the land of Edom before any king reigned over the Israelites: 32 Bela the son of Beor reigned in Edom, and the name of his city was Dinhabah. 33 Now Bela died, and Jobab the son of Zerah of Bozrah reigned as his successor. 34 Then Jobab died, and Husham of the land of the Temanites reigned as his successor. 35 And Husham died, and Hadad the son of Bedad, who defeated Midian in the country of Moab, reigned as his successor. The name of his [walled] city was Avith. 36 Hadad died, and Samlah of Masrekah succeeded him. 37 Then Samlah died, and Shaul of Rehoboth on the river [Euphrates] reigned as his successor. 38 And Shaul died, and Baal-hanan son of Achbor reigned as his successor. 39 Baal-hanan the son of Achbor died, and then Hadar reigned [as his successor]. His [walled] city was Pau; his wife’s name was Mehetabel the daughter of Matred, the daughter of Mezahab.\n40 And these are the names of the tribal chiefs of Esau, according to their families and places of residence, by their names: Chiefs Timna, Alvah, Jetheth, 41 Oholibamah, Elah, Pinon, 42 Kenaz, Teman, Mibzar, 43 Magdiel, and Iram. These are the tribal chiefs of Edom (that is, of Esau the father of the Edomites), according to their dwelling places in the land of their possession.\n\nGenesis 37\nJoseph’s Dream\n\n1S o Jacob (Israel) lived in the land where his father [Isaac] had been a stranger (sojourner, resident alien), in the land of Canaan. 2 These are the generations of Jacob.\nJoseph, when he was seventeen years old, was shepherding the flock with his brothers [Dan, Naphtali, Gad, and Asher]; the boy was with the sons of Bilhah and Zilpah, his father’s [secondary] wives; and Joseph brought back a bad report about them to their father. 3 Now Israel (Jacob) loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a [distinctive] multicolored tunic. 4 His brothers saw that their father loved Joseph more than all of his brothers; so they hated him and could not [find it within themselves to] speak to him on friendly terms.\n5 Now Joseph dreamed a dream, and he told it to his brothers, and they hated him even more. 6 He said to them, “Please listen to [the details of] this dream which I have dreamed; 7 we [brothers] were binding sheaves [of grain stalks] in the field, and lo, my sheaf [suddenly] got up and stood upright and remained standing; and behold, your sheaves stood all around my sheaf and bowed down [in respect].” 8 His brothers said to him, “Are you actually going to reign over us? Are you really going to rule and govern us as your subjects?” So they hated him even more for [telling them about] his dreams and for his [arrogant] words.\n9 But Joseph dreamed still another dream, and told it to his brothers [as well]. He said, “See here, I have again dreamed a dream, and lo, [this time I saw] eleven stars and the sun and the moon bowed down [in respect] to me!” 10 He told it to his father as well as to his brothers; but his father rebuked him and said to him [in disbelief], “What is [the meaning of] this dream that you have dreamed? Shall I and your mother and your brothers actually come to bow down to the ground [in respect] before you?” 11 Joseph’s brothers were envious and jealous of him, but his father kept the words [of Joseph] in mind [wondering about their meaning].\n12 Then his brothers went to pasture their father’s flock near Shechem. 13 Israel (Jacob) said to Joseph, “Are not your brothers pasturing [the flock] at Shechem? Come, and I will send you to them.” And he said, “Here I am [ready to obey you].” 14 Then Jacob said to him, “Please go and see whether everything is all right with your brothers and all right with the flock; then bring word [back] to me.” So he sent him from the Hebron Valley, and he went to Shechem.\n15 Now a certain man found Joseph, and saw that he was wandering around and had lost his way in the field; so the man asked him, “What are you looking for?” 16 He said, “I am looking for my brothers. Please tell me where they are pasturing our flocks.” 17 Then the man said, “[They were here, but] they have moved on from this place. I heard them say, ‘Let us go to Dothan.’” So Joseph went after his brothers and found them at Dothan.\nThe Plot against Joseph 18 And when they saw him from a distance, even before he came close to them, they plotted to kill him. 19 They said to one another, “Look, here comes this dreamer. 20 “Now then, come and let us kill him and throw him into one of the pits (cisterns, underground water storage); then we will say [to our father], ‘A wild animal killed and devoured him’; and we shall see what will become of his dreams!” 21 Now Reuben [the eldest] heard this and rescued him from their hands and said, “Let us not take his life.” 22 Reuben said to them, “Do not shed his blood, but [instead] throw him [alive] into the pit that is here in the wilderness, and do not lay a hand on him [to kill him]”—[he said this so] that he could rescue him from them and return him [safely] to his father. 23 Now when Joseph reached his brothers, they stripped him of his tunic, the [distinctive] multicolored tunic which he was wearing; 24 then they took him and threw him into the pit. Now the pit was empty; there was no water in it.\n\n25 Then they sat down to eat their meal. When they looked up, they saw a caravan of Ishmaelites coming from Gilead [east of the Jordan], with their camels bearing ladanum resin [for perfume] and balm and myrrh, going on their way to carry the cargo down to Egypt. 26 Judah said to his brothers, “What do we gain if we kill our brother and cover up his blood (murder)? 27 “Come, let us [instead] sell him to these Ishmaelites [and Midianites] and not lay our hands on him, because he is our brother and our flesh.” So his brothers listened to him and agreed. 28 Then as the Midianite [and Ishmaelite] traders were passing by, the brothers pulled Joseph up and lifted him out of the pit, and they sold him to the Ishmaelites for twenty shekels of silver. And so they took Joseph [as a captive] into Egypt.\n29 Now Reuben [unaware of what had happened] returned to the pit, and [to his great alarm found that] Joseph was not in the pit; so he tore his clothes [in deep sorrow]. 30 He rejoined his brothers and said, “The boy is not there; as for me, where shall I go [to hide from my father]?” 31 Then they took Joseph’s tunic, slaughtered a male goat and dipped the tunic in the blood; 32 and they brought the multicolored tunic to their father, saying, “We have found this; please examine it and decide whether or not it is your son’s tunic.” 33 He recognized it and said, “It is my son’s tunic. A wild animal has devoured him; Joseph is without doubt torn in pieces!” 34 So Jacob tore his clothes [in grief], put on sackcloth and mourned many days for his son. 35 Then all his sons and daughters attempted to console him, but he refused to be comforted and said, “I will go down to Sheol (the place of the dead) in mourning for my son.” And his father wept for him. 36 Meanwhile, in Egypt the Midianites sold Joseph [as a slave] to Potiphar, an officer of Pharaoh and the captain of the [royal] guard.\n\nGenesis 38\nJudah And Tamar\n\n1 Now at that time, Judah left his brothers and went down to [stay with] a certain Adullamite named Hirah. 2 There Judah saw a daughter of Shua, a Canaanite, and he took her [as his wife] and lived with her. 3 So she conceived and gave birth to a son and Judah named him Er. 4 Then she conceived again and gave birth to a son and named him Onan. 5 Again she conceived and gave birth to still another son and named him Shelah. It was at Chezib that she gave birth to him.\n6 Now Judah took a wife for Er his firstborn; her name was Tamar. 7 But Er, Judah’s firstborn, was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD killed him [in judgment]. 8 Then Judah told Onan, “Go in to your brother’s widow, and perform your duty as a brother-in-law [under the levirate marriage custom]; [be her husband and] raise children for [the name of] your brother.” 9 Onan knew that the child (heir) would not be his [but his dead brother’s]; so whenever he lay with his brother’s widow, he spilled his seed on the ground [to prevent conception], so that he would not give a child to his brother. 10 But what he did was displeasing in the sight of the LORD; therefore He killed him also [in judgment]. 11 Then Judah said to Tamar, his daughter-in-law, “Remain a widow at your father’s house until Shelah my [youngest] son is grown”; [but he was deceiving her] for he thought that [if Shelah should marry her] he too might die like his brothers did. So Tamar went and lived in her father’s house.\n12 But quite a while later, Judah’s wife, the daughter of Shua, died; and when the time of mourning was ended, he went up to his sheepshearers at Timnah with his friend Hirah the Adullamite. 13 Tamar was told, “Listen, your father-in-law is going up to Timnah to shear his sheep.” 14 So she removed her widow’s clothes and covered herself with a veil, and wrapped herself up [in disguise], and sat in the gateway of Enaim, which is on the road to Timnah; for she saw that Shelah had grown up, and she had not been given to him as a wife [as Judah had promised]. 15 When Judah saw her, he thought she was a [temple] prostitute, for she had covered her face [as such women did]. 16 He turned to her by the road, and said, “Please come, let me lie with you”; for he did not know that she was his daughter-in-law. And she said, “What will you give me, that you may lie with me?” 17 He answered, “I will send you a young goat from the flock.” And she said, “Will you give me a pledge [as a deposit] until you send it?” 18 He said, “What pledge shall I give you?” She said, “Your seal and your cord, and the staff that is in your hand.” So he gave them to her and was intimate with her, and she conceived by him. 19 Then she got up and left, and removed her veil and put on her widow’s clothing.\n20 When Judah sent the young goat by his friend the Adullamite, to get his pledge [back] from the woman, he was unable to find her. 21 He asked the men of that place, “Where is the temple prostitute who was by the roadside at Enaim?” They said, “There was no prostitute here.” 22 So he returned to Judah, and said, “I cannot find her; also the local men said, ‘There was no prostitute around here.’” 23 Then Judah said, “Let her keep the things (pledge articles) for herself, otherwise we will be a laughingstock [searching everywhere for her]. After all, I sent this young goat, but you did not find her.”\n24 About three months later Judah was told, “Tamar your daughter-in-law has played the [role of a] prostitute, and she is with child because of her immorality.” So Judah said, “Bring her out and let her be burned [to death as punishment]!” 25 While she was being brought out, she [took the things Judah had given her and] sent [them along with a message] to her father-in-law, saying, “I am with child by the man to whom these articles belong.” And she added, “Please examine [them carefully] and see [clearly] to whom these things belong, the seal and the cord and staff.” 26 Judah recognized the articles, and said, “She has been more righteous [in this matter] than I, because I did not give her to my son Shelah [as I had promised].” And Judah did not have [intimate] relations with her again.\n\n27 Now when the time came for her to give birth, there were twins in her womb. 28 And when she was in labor, one [baby] put out his hand, and the midwife took his hand and tied a scarlet thread on it, saying, “This one was born first.” 29 But he pulled back his hand, and his brother was born first. And she said, “What a breach you have made for yourself [to be the firstborn]!” So he was named Perez (breach, break forth). 30 Afterward his brother who had the scarlet [thread] on his hand was born and was named Zerah (brightness).\n\nGenesis 39\nJoseph’s Success In Egypt\n\n1 Now Joseph had been taken down to Egypt; and Potiphar, an Egyptian officer of Pharaoh, the captain of the [royal] guard, bought him from the Ishmaelites, who had taken him down there. 2 The LORD was with Joseph, and he [even though a slave] became a successful and prosperous man; and he was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. 3 Now his master saw that the LORD was with him and that the LORD caused all that he did to prosper (succeed) in his hand. 4 So Joseph pleased Potiphar and found favor in his sight and he served him as his personal servant. He made Joseph overseer over his house, and he put all that he owned in Joseph’s charge. 5 It happened that from the time that he made Joseph overseer in his house and [put him in charge] over all that he owned, that the LORD blessed the Egyptian’s house because of Joseph; so the LORD’S blessing was on everything that Potiphar owned, in the house and in the field. 6 So Potiphar left all that he owned in Joseph’s charge; and with Joseph there he did not [need to] pay attention to anything except the food he ate.\nNow Joseph was handsome and attractive in form and appearance. 7 Then after a time his master’s wife looked at Joseph with desire, and she said, “Lie with me.” 8 But he refused and said to his master’s wife, “Look, with me in the house, my master does not concern himself with anything; he has put everything that he owns in my charge. 9 “He is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept anything from me except you, because you are his wife. How then could I do this great evil and sin against God [and your husband]?” 10 And so it was that she spoke to Joseph [persistently] day after day, but he did not listen to her [plea] to lie beside her or be with her. 11 Then it happened one day that Joseph went into the house to attend to his duties, and none of the men of the household was there in the house. 12 She caught Joseph by his [outer] robe, saying, “Lie with me!” But he left his robe in her hand and ran, and got outside [the house]. 13 When she saw that he had left his robe in her hand and had run outside, 14 she called to the men of her household and said to them, “Look at this, your master has brought a Hebrew [into the household] to mock and insult us; he came to me to lie with me, and I screamed. 15 “When he heard me screaming, he left his robe with me and ran outside [the house].” 16 So she left Joseph’s [outer] robe beside her until his master came home. 17 Then she told her husband the same story, saying, “The Hebrew servant, whom you brought among us, came to me to mock and insult me; 18 then as soon as I raised my voice and screamed, he left his robe with me and ran outside [the house].”\nJoseph Imprisoned 19 And when Joseph’s master heard the words of his wife, saying, “This is the way your servant treated me,” his anger burned. 20 So Joseph’s master took him and put him in the prison, a place where the king’s prisoners were confined; so he was there in the prison. 21 But the LORD was with Joseph and extended lovingkindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the warden. 22 The warden committed to Joseph’s care (management) all the prisoners who were in the prison; so that whatever was done there, he was in charge of it. 23 The warden paid no attention to anything that was in Joseph’s care because the LORD was with him; whatever Joseph did, the LORD made to prosper.\n\nGenesis 40\nJoseph Interprets A Dream\n\n1 Now some time later, the cupbearer (butler) and the baker for the king of Egypt offended their lord, Egypt’s king. 2 Pharaoh (Sesostris II) was extremely angry with his two officials, the chief of the cupbearers and the chief of the bakers. 3 He put them in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, in the same prison where Joseph was confined. 4 The captain of the guard put Joseph in charge of them, and he served them; and they continued to be in custody for some time. 5 Then the cupbearer and the baker of the king of Egypt, who were confined in the prison, both dreamed a dream in the same night, each man with his [own significant] dream and each dream with its [personal] interpretation. 6 When Joseph came to them in the morning and looked at them, [he saw that] they were sad and depressed. 7 So he asked Pharaoh’s officials who were in confinement with him in his master’s house, “Why do you look so down-hearted today?” 8 And they said to him, “We have [each] dreamed [distinct] dreams and there is no one to interpret them.” So Joseph said to them, “Do not interpretations belong to God? Please tell me [your dreams].”\n9 So the chief cupbearer told his dream to Joseph, and said to him, “In my dream there was a grapevine in front of me; 10 and on the vine were three branches. Then as soon as it budded, its blossoms burst open, and its clusters produced ripe grapes [in rapid succession]. 11 “Now Pharaoh’s cup was in my hand, and I took the grapes and squeezed them into Pharaoh’s cup; then I placed the cup into Pharaoh’s hand.” 12 Then Joseph said to him, “This is the interpretation of it: the three branches represent three days; 13 within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head (present you in public) and restore you to your position; and you will [again] put Pharaoh’s cup into his hand just as [you did] when you were his cupbearer. 14 Only think of me when it goes well with you, and please show me kindness by mentioning me to Pharaoh and get me out of this house. 15 “For in fact I was taken (stolen) from the land of the Hebrews by [unlawful] force, and even here I have done nothing for which they should put me in the dungeon.”\n16 When the chief baker saw that the interpretation [of the dream] was good, he said to Joseph, “I also dreamed, and [in my dream] there were three cake baskets on my head; 17 and in the top basket there were some of all sorts of baked food for Pharaoh, but the birds [of prey] were eating [these foods] out of the basket on my head.” 18 Joseph answered, “This is the interpretation of it: the three baskets represent three days; 19 within three more days Pharaoh will lift up your head and will hang you on a tree (gallows, pole), and [you will not so much as be given a burial, but] the birds will eat your flesh.”\n20 Now on the third day, [which was] the Pharaoh’s birthday, he [released the two men from prison and] made a feast for all his servants; and he lifted up the head of the chief cupbearer and the head of the chief baker [that is, presented them in public] among his servants. 21 He restored the chief cupbearer to his office, and the cupbearer [once again] put the cup into Pharaoh’s hand; 22 but Pharaoh hanged the chief baker, just as Joseph had interpreted [the meaning of the dreams] to them. 23 Yet [even after all that] the chief cupbearer did not remember Joseph, but forgot [all about] him.\n\nGenesis 41\nPharaoh’s Dream\n\n1 Now it happened at the end of two full years that Pharaoh dreamed that he was standing by the Nile. 2 And lo, there came up out of the Nile seven [healthy] cows, sleek and handsome and fat; and they grazed in the reed grass [in a marshy pasture]. 3 Then behold, seven other cows came up after them out of the Nile, ugly and gaunt and raw-boned, and stood by the fat cows on the bank of the Nile. 4 Then the ugly and gaunt and raw-boned cows ate up the seven sleek and fat cows. Then Pharaoh awoke. 5 Then he fell asleep and dreamed a second time; and behold, seven ears of grain came up on a single stalk, plump and good. 6 Then behold, seven ears [of grain], thin and dried up by the east wind, sprouted after them. 7 Then the thin ears swallowed the seven plump and full ears. And Pharaoh awoke, and it was a dream. 8 So when morning came his spirit was troubled and disturbed and he sent and called for all the magicians and all the wise men of Egypt. And Pharaoh told them his dreams, but no one could interpret them to him.\n\n9 Then the chief cupbearer spoke to Pharaoh, saying, “I would mention my faults today. 10 [Two years ago] Pharaoh was angry with his servants, and he put me in confinement in the house of the captain of the guard, both me and the chief baker. 11 We dreamed a dream on the same night, he and I; each of us dreamed according to [the significance of] the interpretation of his own dream. 12 Now there was with us [in the prison] a young man, a Hebrew, servant to the captain of the guard; and we told him, and he interpreted our dreams for us, to each man according to the significance of his own dream. 13 “And just as he interpreted [the dreams] for us, so it happened; I was restored to my office [as chief cupbearer], and the baker was hanged.”\n\nJoseph Interprets 14 Then Pharaoh sent and called for Joseph, and they hurriedly brought him out of the dungeon; and when Joseph shaved himself and changed his clothes [making himself presentable], he came to Pharaoh. 15 Pharaoh said to Joseph, “I have dreamed a dream, and there is no one who can interpret it; and I have heard it said about you that you can understand a dream and interpret it.” 16 Joseph answered Pharaoh, “It is not in me [to interpret the dream]; God [not I] will give Pharaoh a favorable answer [through me].” 17 So Pharaoh said to Joseph, “In my dream, I was standing on the bank of the Nile; 18 and seven fat, sleek and handsome cows came up out of the river, and they grazed in the reed grass [of a marshy pasture]. 19 Lo, seven other cows came up after them, very ugly and gaunt [just skin and bones]; such emaciated animals as I have never seen in all the land of Egypt. 20 And the lean and ugly cows ate up the first seven fat cows. 21 Yet when they had devoured them, it could not be detected that they had eaten them, because they were still as thin and emaciated as before. Then I awoke [but again I fell asleep and dreamed]. 22 I saw in my [second] dream, seven ears [of grain], plump and good, growing on a single stalk; 23 and lo, seven [other] ears, withered, thin, and scorched by the east wind, sprouted after them; 24 and the thin ears devoured the seven good ears. Now I told this to the magicians and soothsayers, but there was no one who could explain it [to me].”\n25 Then Joseph said to Pharaoh, “The [two] dreams are one [and the same and have one interpretation]; God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 26 The seven good cows are seven years, and the seven good ears are seven years; the [two] dreams are one [and the same]. 27 The seven thin and ugly cows that came up after them are seven years; and also the seven thin ears, dried up and scorched by the east wind, they are seven years of famine and hunger. 28 This is the message just as I have told Pharaoh: God has shown Pharaoh what He is about to do. 29 Listen very carefully: seven years of great abundance will come throughout all the land of Egypt; 30 but afterward seven years of famine and hunger will come, and [there will be such desperate need that] all the great abundance [of the previous years] will be forgotten in the land of Egypt [as if it never happened], and famine and destitution will ravage and destroy the land. 31 So the great abundance will become forgotten in the land because of that subsequent famine, for it will be very severe. 32 That the dream was repeated twice to Pharaoh [and in two different ways] indicates that this matter is fully determined and established by God, and God will bring it to pass very quickly. 33 So now let Pharaoh [prepare ahead and] look for a man discerning and clear-headed and wise, and set him [in charge] over the land of Egypt [as governor under Pharaoh]. 34 Let Pharaoh take action to appoint overseers and officials over the land, and set aside one-fifth [of the produce] of the [entire] land of Egypt in the seven years of abundance. 35 Let them gather [as a tax] all [of the fifth of] the food of these good years that are coming, and store up grain under the direction and authority of Pharaoh, and let them guard the food [in fortified granaries] in the cities. 36 “That food shall be put [in storage] as a reserve for the land against the seven years of famine and hunger which will occur in the land of Egypt, so that the land (people) will not be ravaged during the famine.”\n37 Now the plan seemed good to Pharaoh and to all of his servants. Joseph Is Made a Ruler of Egypt 38 So Pharaoh said to his servants, “Can we find a man like this [a man equal to Joseph], in whom is the divine spirit [of God]?” 39 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Since [your] God has shown you all this, there is no one as discerning and clear-headed and wise as you are. 40 “You shall have charge over my house, and all my people shall be governed according to your word and pay respect [to you with reverence, submission, and obedience]; only in [matters of] the throne will I be greater than you [in Egypt].” 41 Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “See, I have set you [in charge] over all the land of Egypt.” 42 Then Pharaoh took off his signet ring from his hand and put it on Joseph’s hand, and dressed him in [official] vestments of fine linen and put a gold chain around his neck. 43 He had him ride in his second chariot; and runners proclaimed before him, “[Attention,] bow the knee!” And he set him over all the land of Egypt. 44 Moreover, Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Though I am Pharaoh, yet without your permission shall no man raise his hand [to do anything] or set his foot [to go anywhere] in all the land of Egypt [all classes of people shall submit to your authority].” 45 Then Pharaoh named Joseph Zaphenath-paneah; and he gave him Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On (Heliopolis in Egypt), as his wife. And Joseph went out over all the land of Egypt [to inspect and govern it].\n46 Now Joseph [had been in Egypt thirteen years and] was thirty years old when he stood before Pharaoh, king of Egypt. Joseph departed from the presence of Pharaoh and went through all the land of Egypt [performing his duties]. 47 In the seven abundant years the earth produced handfuls [for each seed planted]. 48 And Joseph gathered all the [surplus] food of the seven [good] years in the land of Egypt and stored [enormous quantities of] the food in the cities. He stored away in every city the food [collected] from its own surrounding fields. 49 Thus Joseph gathered and stored up grain in great abundance like the sand of the sea, until he stopped counting it, for it could not be measured.\nThe Sons of Joseph 50 Now two sons were born to Joseph before the years of famine came, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On, bore to him. 51 Joseph named the firstborn Manasseh (causing to forget), for he said, “God has made me forget all my trouble and hardship and all [the sorrow of the loss of] my father’s household.” 52 He named the second [son] Ephraim (fruitfulness), for “God has caused me to be fruitful and very successful in the land of my suffering.”\n\n53 When the seven years of plenty came to an end in the land of Egypt, 54 the seven years of famine began to come, just as Joseph had said [they would]; the famine was in all the [surrounding] lands, but in the land of Egypt there was bread (food). 55 So when all the land of Egypt was famished, the people cried out to Pharaoh for food; and Pharaoh said to all the Egyptians, “Go to Joseph; do whatever he says to you.” 56 When the famine was spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the storehouses, and sold [surplus grain] to the Egyptians; and the famine grew [extremely] severe in the land of Egypt. 57 And [the people of] all countries came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe over all the [known] earth.\n\nGenesis 42\nJoseph’s Brothers Sent To Egypt\n\n1Now when Jacob (Israel) learned that there was grain in Egypt, he said to his sons, “Why are you staring at one another [in bewilderment and not taking action]?” 2He said, “I have heard that there is grain in Egypt; go down there and buy [some] grain for us, so that we may live and not die [of starvation].” 3So ten of Joseph’s brothers went down to buy grain in Egypt. 4But Jacob did not send Benjamin, Joseph’s [younger] brother, with his brothers, for he said, “I am afraid that some harm or injury may come to him.” 5So the sons of Israel came [to Egypt] to buy grain along with the others who were coming, for famine was in the land of Canaan also.\n\n6Now Joseph was the ruler over the land, and he was the one who sold [grain] to all the people of the land; and Joseph’s [half] brothers came and bowed down before him with their faces to the ground. 7When Joseph saw his brothers he recognized them, but [hiding his identity] he treated them as strangers and spoke harshly to them. He said to them, “Where have you come from?” And they said, “From the land of Canaan, to buy food.”\n\n8Joseph recognized his brothers, but they did not recognize him. 9Joseph remembered the dreams he had dreamed about them, and said to them, “You are spies; you have come [with a malicious purpose] to observe the undefended parts of our land.” 10But they said to him, “No, my lord, for your servants have [only] come to buy food. 11“We are all the sons of one man; we are honest men, your servants are not spies.” 12Yet he said to them, “No, you have come to see the undefended parts of our land.” 13But they said, “Your servants are twelve brothers [in all], the sons of one man in the land of Canaan; please listen: the youngest is with our father today, and one is no longer alive.” 14Joseph said to them, “It is as I said to you, you are spies. 15In this way you shall be tested: by the life of Pharaoh, you shall not leave this place unless your youngest brother comes here! 16“Send one of you [back home], and let him bring your brother [here], while [the rest of] you remain confined, so that your words may be tested, [to see] whether there is any truth in you [and your story]; or else, by the life of Pharaoh, certainly you are spies.” 17Then Joseph put them all in prison for three days.\n\n18Now Joseph said to them on the third day, “Do this and [you may] live, for I fear God: 19if you are honest men, let one of your brothers be confined in your [place here in] prison; but as for the rest of you, go, carry grain for the famine in your households, 20but bring your youngest brother to me, so your words will be verified and you will not die.” And they did so. 21And they said to one another, “Truly we are guilty regarding our brother [Joseph], because we saw the distress and anguish of his soul when he pleaded with us [to let him go], yet we would not listen [to his cry]; so this distress and anguish has come on us.” 22Reuben answered them, “Did I not tell you, ‘Do not sin against the boy’; and you would not listen? Now the accounting for his blood is required [of us for we are guilty of his death].” 23They did not know that Joseph understood [their conversation], because he spoke to them through an interpreter. 24He turned away from his brothers and [left the room and] wept; then he returned and talked with them, and took Simeon from them and bound him in front of them [to be kept as a hostage in Egypt]. 25Then Joseph gave orders [privately] that their bags be filled with grain, and that every man’s money [used to pay for the grain] be put back in his sack, and that provisions be given to them for the journey. And so this was done for them.\n\n26They loaded their donkeys with grain and left from there. 27And at the lodging place, as one of them opened his sack to feed his donkey, he saw his money in the opening of his sack. 28And he said to his brothers, “My money has been returned! Here it is in my sack!” And their hearts sank, and they were afraid and turned trembling to one another, saying, “What is this that God has done to us?”\n\nThe Return to Canaan 29When they came to Jacob their father in the land of Canaan, they told him everything that had happened to them, saying, 30“The man who is the lord of the land spoke harshly to us, and took us for spies of the land. 31But we told him, ‘We are honest men; we are not spies. 32‘We are twelve brothers, sons of our father; one is no longer alive, and the youngest is with our father today in the land of Canaan.’ 33And the man, the lord of the country, said to us, ‘By this [test] I will know that you are honest men: leave one of your brothers here with me and take grain for your starving households and go. 34‘Bring your youngest brother to me; then I will know that you are not spies, but that you are honest men. Then I will return your [imprisoned] brother [back] to you, and you may trade and do business in the land.’”\n\n35Now when they emptied their sacks, every man’s bundle of money [paid to buy grain] was in his sack. When they and their father saw the bundles of money, they were afraid. 36Jacob their father said to them, “You have bereaved me [by causing the loss] of my children. Joseph is no more, and Simeon is no more, and you would take Benjamin [from me]. All these things are [working] against me.” 37Then Reuben spoke to his father, “You may put my two sons to death if I do not bring Benjamin back to you; put him in my care, and I will return him to you.” 38But Jacob said, “My son shall not go down [to Egypt] with you; for his brother is dead, and he alone is left [of Rachel’s children]. If any harm or accident should happen to him on the journey you are taking, then you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol (the place of the dead) in sorrow.”\n\nGenesis 43\nThe Return To Egypt\n\n1Now the famine was very severe in the land [of Canaan]. 2And it happened that when the families of Jacob’s sons had finished eating [all of] the grain which they had brought from Egypt, their father said to them, “Go again, buy us a little food.” 3But Judah said to him, “The man [representing Pharaoh] solemnly and sternly warned us, saying, ‘You will not see my face [again] unless your brother is with you.’ 4If you will send our brother with us, we will go down [to Egypt] and buy you food. 5“But if you will not send him, we will not go down there; for the man said to us, ‘You will not see my face unless your brother is with you.’” 6And Israel (Jacob) said, “Why did you treat me so badly by telling the man that you had another brother?” 7And they said, “The man asked us straightforward questions about ourselves and our relatives. He said, ‘Is your father still alive? Have you another brother?’ And we answered him accordingly. How could we possibly know that he would say, ‘Bring your brother down [here to Egypt]’?” 8Judah said to Israel his father, “Send the young man with me and we will get up and go [buy food], so that we may live and not die [of starvation], we as well as you and our little ones. 9I will be security (a guarantee) for him; you may hold me [personally] responsible for him. If I do not bring him [back] to you and place him [safely] before you, then let me bear the blame before you forever. 10“For if we had not delayed like this, surely by now we would have returned the second time.”\n\n11Then their father Israel said to them, “If it must be so, then do this; take some of the choicest products of the land in your sacks, and carry it as a present [of tribute] to the man [representing Pharaoh], a little balm and a little honey, aromatic spices or gum, resin, pistachio nuts, and almonds. 12Take double the [amount of] money with you, and take back the money that was returned in the opening of your sacks; perhaps it was an oversight. 13Take your brother [Benjamin] also, and get up, and go to the man; 14and may God Almighty grant you compassion and favor before the man, so that he will release to you your other brother [Simeon] and Benjamin. And as for me, if I am bereaved of my children [Joseph, Simeon, and Benjamin], I am bereaved.” 15Then the men took the present, and they took double the [amount of] money with them, and Benjamin; then they left and went down to Egypt and stood before Joseph.\n\nJoseph Sees Benjamin 16When Joseph saw Benjamin with them, he said to the steward of his house, “Bring the men into the house, and kill an animal and make [a meal] ready; for the men will dine with me at noon.” 17So the man did as Joseph said, and brought the men to Joseph’s house. 18The men were afraid, because they were brought to Joseph’s house; and [expecting the worst] they said, “It is because of the money that was returned in our sacks the first time [we came] that we are being brought in, so that he may find a reason to accuse us and assail us, and take us as slaves, and seize our donkeys.” 19So they approached the steward of Joseph’s house, and talked with him at the entrance of the house, 20and said, “Oh, my lord, we indeed came down here the first time to buy food; 21and when we arrived at the inn [after leaving here], we opened our sacks and there was each man’s money [with which he had paid for grain], in full, returned in the mouth of his sack. So we have brought it back [this time]. 22“We have also brought down with us additional money to buy food; we do not know who put our money [back] in our sacks [last time].” 23But the steward [encouraged them and] said, “Peace be to you, do not be afraid; your God and the God of your father has [miraculously] given you treasure in your sacks. I [already] had your money [which you paid to us].” Then he brought Simeon out to them. 24Then the steward brought the men into Joseph’s house and gave them water, and they washed [the dust off] their feet; and he gave their donkeys feed. 25So they prepared the present [of tribute] for Joseph before his arrival at noon; for they had heard that they were to eat a meal there.\n\n26When Joseph came home, they brought into the house to him the present [of tribute] which they had with them and bowed to the ground before him. 27He asked them about their well-being, and said, “Is your old father well, of whom you spoke? Is he still alive?” 28And they answered, “Your servant our father is in good health; he is still alive.” And they bowed down [their heads before Joseph] in respect. 29And he looked up and saw his brother Benjamin, his mother’s [only other] son, and said, “Is this your youngest brother, of whom you spoke to me?” And Joseph said, “God be gracious to you and show you favor, my son.” 30Then Joseph hurried out [of the room] because his heart was deeply touched over his brother, and he sought privacy to weep; so he entered his chamber and wept there. 31Then he washed his face and came out, and, restraining himself, said, “Let the meal be served.” 32So the servants served Joseph by himself [in honor of his rank], and his brothers by themselves, and the Egyptians who ate with him by themselves, because [according to custom] the Egyptians could not eat food with the Hebrews, for that is loathsome to the Egyptians. 33Now Joseph’s brothers were seated [by the steward] before him [in the order of their birth]—the firstborn according to his birthright and the youngest according to his youth; and the men looked at one another in astonishment [because so much was known about them]. 34Joseph selected and sent portions to them from his own table, but Benjamin’s portion was five times as much as any of theirs. So they feasted and drank freely and celebrated with him.\n\nGenesis 44\nThe Brothers Are Brought Back\n\n1And he commanded the steward of his house, saying, “Fill the men’s sacks with food, as much as they can carry, and put every man’s [grain] money in the mouth of the sack. 2“Put my [personal] cup, the silver cup, in the mouth of the sack of the youngest, with his grain money.” And the steward did as Joseph had told him. 3As soon as the morning was light, the men were sent away, they and their donkeys. 4When they had left the city, and were not yet far away, Joseph said to his steward, “Get up, follow after the men; and when you overtake them, say to them, ‘Why have you repaid evil [to us] for good [paid to you]? 5‘Is this not my lord’s drinking cup and the one which he uses for divination? You have done [a great and unforgivable] wrong in doing this.’”\n\n6So the steward overtook them and he said these words to them. 7They said to him, “Why does my lord speak these things? Far be it from your servants to do such a thing! 8Please remember, the money which we found in the mouths of our sacks we have brought back to you from the land of Canaan. Is it likely then that we would steal silver or gold from your master’s house? 9“With whomever of your servants your master’s cup is found, let him die, and the rest of us will be my lord’s slaves.” 10And the steward said, “Now let it be as you say; he with whom the cup is found will be my slave, but the rest of you shall be blameless.” 11Then every man quickly lowered his sack to the ground and each man opened his sack [confident the cup would not be found among them]. 12The steward searched, beginning with the eldest and ending with the youngest, and the cup was found in Benjamin’s sack. 13Then they tore their clothes [in grief]; and after each man had loaded his donkey again, they returned to the city.\n\n14When Judah and his brothers came to Joseph’s house, he was still there; and they fell to the ground before him. 15Joseph spoke harshly to them, “What is this thing that you have done? Do you not realize that such a man as I can indeed practice divination and foretell [everything you do without outside knowledge of it]?” 16So Judah said, “What can we say to my lord? What can we reply? Or how can we clear ourselves, since God has exposed the sin and guilt of your servants? Behold, we are my lord’s slaves, the rest of us as well as he with whom the cup is found.” 17But Joseph said, “Far be it from me that I should do that; but the man in whose hand the cup has been found, he will be my servant; and as for [the rest of] you, get up and go in peace to your father.”\n\n18Then Judah approached him, and said, “O my lord, please let your servant say a word to you in private, and do not let your anger blaze against your servant, for you are equal to Pharaoh [so I speak as if directly to him]. 19My lord asked his servants, saying, ‘Have you a father or a brother?’ 20We said to my lord, ‘We have an old father and a young [brother, Benjamin, the] child of his old age. Now his brother [Joseph] is dead, and he alone is left of [the two sons born of] his mother, and his father loves him.’ 21Then you said to your servants, ‘Bring him down to me that I may actually see him.’ 22But we said to my lord, ‘The young man cannot leave his father, for if he should leave his father, his father would die.’ 23You said to your servants, ‘Unless your youngest brother comes with you, you shall not see my face again.’ 24So when we went back to your servant my father, we told him what my lord had said. 25Our father said, ‘Go back [to Egypt], and buy us a little food.’ 26But we said, ‘We cannot go down [to Egypt]. If our youngest brother is with us, then we will go down [there]; for we [were sternly told that we] cannot see the man’s face unless our youngest brother is with us.’ 27Your servant my father said to us, ‘You know that my wife [Rachel] bore me [only] two sons. 28‘And one [son] went out from me, and I said, “Surely he is torn to pieces,” and I have not seen him since. 29‘If you take this one also from me, and harm or an accident happens to him, you will bring my gray hair down to Sheol in sorrow.’ 30Now, therefore, when I come to your servant my father, and the young man is not with us, since his life is bound up in the young man’s life, 31when he sees that the young man is not with us, he will die; and your servants will bring the gray hair of your servant our father down to Sheol in [great] sorrow. 32For your servant became security for the young man to my father, saying, ‘If I do not bring him back to you, then let me bear the blame before my father forever.’ 33Now, therefore, please let your servant (Judah) remain here instead of the youth [to be] a slave to my lord, and let the young man go home with his brothers. 34“How can I go up to my father if the young man is not with me—for fear that I would see the tragedy that would overtake my [elderly] father [if Benjamin does not return]?”\n\nGenesis 45\nJoseph Shows Kindness To His Brothers\n\n1Then Joseph could not control himself [any longer] in front of all those who attended him, and he called out, “Have everyone leave me.” So no man stood there when Joseph revealed himself to his brothers. 2Joseph wept aloud, and the Egyptians [who had just left him] heard it, and the household of Pharaoh heard of it. 3Then Joseph said to his brothers, “I am Joseph! Is my father still alive?” But his brothers were speechless, for they were stunned and dismayed by [the fact that they were in] Joseph’s presence.\n\n4And Joseph said to his brothers, “Please come closer to me.” And they approached him. And he said, “I am Joseph your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. 5Now do not be distressed or angry with yourselves because you sold me here, for God sent me ahead of you to save life and preserve our family. 6For the famine has been in the land these two years, and there are still five more years in which there will be no plowing and harvesting. 7God sent me [to Egypt] ahead of you to preserve for you a remnant on the earth, and to keep you alive by a great escape. 8So now it was not you who sent me here, but God; and He has made me a father to Pharaoh and lord of all his household and ruler over all the land of Egypt. 9Hurry and go up to my father, and tell him, ‘Your son Joseph says this to you: God has made me lord of all Egypt; come down to me, do not delay. 10You shall live in the land of Goshen [the best pasture land of Egypt], and you shall be close to me—you and your children and your grandchildren, your flocks and your herds and all you have. 11“There I will provide for you and sustain you, so that you and your household and all that are yours may not become impoverished, for there are still five years of famine to come.”’ 12Look! Your eyes see, and the eyes of my brother Benjamin see, that I am speaking to you [personally in your language and not through an interpreter]. 13“Now you must tell my father of all my splendor and power in Egypt, and of everything that you have seen; and you must hurry and bring my father down here.” 14Then he embraced his brother Benjamin’s neck and wept, and Benjamin wept on his neck. 15He kissed all his brothers and wept on them, and afterward his brothers talked with him.\n\n16When the news was heard in Pharaoh’s house that Joseph’s brothers had come, it pleased Pharaoh and his servants. 17Then Pharaoh said to Joseph, “Tell your brothers, ‘Do this: load your animals and return to the land of Canaan [without delay], 18and get your father and your households and come to me. I will give you the best of the land of Egypt and you will eat the fat (the finest produce) of the land.’ 19Now you [brothers of Joseph] are ordered [by Pharaoh], ‘Do this: take wagons from the land of Egypt for your little ones and for your wives, and bring your father and come. 20‘Do not be concerned with your goods, for the best of all the land of Egypt is yours.’”\n\n21Then the sons of Israel did so; and Joseph gave them wagons according to the command of Pharaoh, and gave them provisions for the journey. 22To each of them Joseph gave changes of clothing, but to Benjamin he gave three hundred pieces of silver and five changes of clothing. 23To his father he sent the following: ten male donkeys loaded with the good things of Egypt, and ten female donkeys loaded with grain and bread and provision for his father [to supply all who were with him] on the journey.\n\n24So he sent his brothers away, and as they departed, he said to them, “See that you do not quarrel on the journey [about how to explain this to our father].” 25So they went up from Egypt, and came to the land of Canaan to Jacob their father, 26and they said to him, “Joseph is still alive, and indeed he is ruler over all the land of Egypt.” But Jacob was stunned and his heart almost stopped beating, because he did not believe them. 27When they told him everything that Joseph had said to them, and when he saw the wagons which Joseph had sent to carry him, the spirit of their father Jacob revived. 28And Israel (Jacob) said, “It is enough! Joseph my son is still alive. I will go and see him before I die.”\n\nGenesis 46\nJacob Moves To Egypt\n\n1So Israel set out with all that he had, and came to Beersheba [where both his father and grandfather had worshiped God], and offered sacrifices to the God of his father Isaac. 2And God spoke to Israel in visions of the night and said, “Jacob, Jacob!” And he said, “Here I am.” 3And He said, “I am God, the God of your father; do not be afraid to go down to Egypt, for I will make you (your descendants) a great nation there. 4“I will go down with you to Egypt, and I will also surely bring you (your people) up again; and Joseph will put his hand on your eyes [to close them at the time of your death].”\n\n5So Jacob set out from Beersheba; and the sons of Israel carried their father Jacob and their children and their wives in the wagons that Pharaoh had sent to carry him. 6And they took their livestock and the possessions which they had acquired in the land of Canaan and came to Egypt, Jacob and all his descendants with him. 7His sons and his grandsons, his daughters and his granddaughters, and all his descendants he brought with him to Egypt.\n\nThose Who Came to Egypt 8Now these are the names of the sons of Israel, Jacob and his sons, who went to Egypt: Reuben, Jacob’s firstborn. 9The sons of Reuben: Hanoch, Pallu, Hezron, and Carmi. 10The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman. 11The sons of Levi: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 12The sons of Judah: Er, Onan, Shelah, Perez, and Zerah—but Er and Onan died in the land of Canaan. And the sons of Perez were Hezron and Hamul. 13The sons of Issachar: Tola, Puvah, Job, and Shimron. 14The sons of Zebulun: Sered, Elon, and Jahleel. 15These are the sons of Leah, whom she bore to Jacob in Paddan-aram, with his daughter Dinah; all of his sons and daughters numbered thirty-three. 16The sons of Gad: Ziphion, Haggi, Shuni, Ezbon, Eri, Arodi, and Areli. 17The sons of Asher: Imnah, Ishvah, Ishvi, Beriah, and Serah their sister. And the sons of Beriah: Heber and Malchiel. 18These are the sons of Zilpah, [the maid] whom Laban gave to Leah his daughter [when she married Jacob]; and she bore to Jacob these sixteen persons [two sons and fourteen grandchildren]. 19The sons of Rachel, Jacob’s wife: Joseph and Benjamin. 20Now to Joseph in the land of Egypt were born Manasseh and Ephraim, whom Asenath, the daughter of Potiphera, priest of On (Heliopolis in Egypt), bore to him. 21And the sons of Benjamin: Bela, Becher, Ashbel, Gera, Naaman, Ehi, Rosh, Muppim, Huppim, and Ard. 22These are the sons of Rachel, who were born to Jacob; [there were] fourteen persons in all [two sons and twelve grandchildren]. 23The son of Dan: Hushim. 24The sons of Naphtali: Jahzeel, Guni, Jezer, and Shillem. 25These are the sons of Bilhah, [the maid] whom Laban gave to Rachel his daughter [when she married Jacob]. And she bore these to Jacob; [there were] seven persons in all [two sons and five grandchildren]. 26All the persons who came with Jacob into Egypt—who were his direct descendants, not counting the wives of [Jacob or] Jacob’s sons, were sixty-six persons in all, 27and the sons of Joseph, who were born to him in Egypt, were two. All the persons of the house of Jacob [including Jacob, and Joseph and his sons], who came into Egypt, were seventy.\n\n28Now Jacob (Israel) sent Judah ahead of him to Joseph, to direct him to Goshen; and they came into the land of Goshen. 29Then Joseph prepared his chariot and went up to meet Israel his father in Goshen; as soon as he presented himself before him (authenticating his identity), he fell on his [father’s] neck and wept on his neck a [very] long time. 30And Israel said to Joseph, “Now let me die [in peace], since I have seen your face [and know] that you are still alive.” 31Joseph said to his brothers and to his father’s household, “I will go up and tell Pharaoh, and say to him, ‘My brothers and my father’s household, who were in the land of Canaan, have come to me; 32and the men are shepherds, for they have been keepers of livestock; and they have brought their flocks and their herds and all that they have.’ 33And it shall be that when Pharaoh calls you and says, ‘What is your occupation?’ 34you shall say, ‘Your servants have been keepers of livestock from our youth until now, both we and our fathers [before us],’ in order that you may live [separately and securely] in the land of Goshen; for every shepherd is repulsive to the Egyptians.”\n\nGenesis 47\nJacob’s Family Settles In Goshen\n\n1Then Joseph came and told Pharaoh, “My father and my brothers, with their flocks and their herds and all that they own, have come from the land of Canaan, and they are in the land of Goshen.” 2He took five men from among his brothers and presented them to Pharaoh. 3And Pharaoh said to his brothers [as Joseph expected], “What is your occupation?” And they said to Pharaoh, “Your servants are shepherds, both we and our fathers [before us].” 4Moreover, they said to Pharaoh, “We have come to live temporarily (sojourn) in the land [of Egypt], for there is no pasture for the flocks of your servants [in our land], for the famine is very severe in Canaan. So now, please let your servants live in the land of Goshen.” 5Then Pharaoh spoke to Joseph, saying, “Your father and your brothers have come to you. 6“The land of Egypt is before you; settle your father and your brothers in the best of the land. Let them live in the land of Goshen; and if you know of any men of ability among them, put them in charge of my livestock.”\n\n7Then Joseph brought Jacob (Israel) his father and presented him before Pharaoh; and Jacob blessed Pharaoh. 8And Pharaoh asked Jacob, “How old are you?” 9Jacob said to Pharaoh, “The years of my pilgrimage are a hundred and thirty. Few and unpleasant have been the years of my life, and they have not reached the years that my fathers lived during the days of their pilgrimage.” 10And Jacob blessed Pharaoh, and departed from his presence. 11So Joseph settled his father and brothers and gave them a possession in Egypt, in the best of the land, in the land of Rameses (Goshen), as Pharaoh commanded. 12Joseph provided and supplied his father and his brothers and all his father’s household with food, according to [the needs of] their children.\n\n13Now [in the course of time] there was no food in all the land, for the famine was distressingly severe, so that the land of Egypt and all the land of Canaan languished [in destitution and starvation] because of the famine. 14Joseph gathered all the money that was found in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan [in payment] for the grain which they bought, and Joseph brought the money into Pharaoh’s house. 15And when the money was exhausted in the land of Egypt and in the land of Canaan, all the Egyptians came to Joseph and said, “Give us food! Why should we die before your very eyes? For our money is gone.” 16Joseph said, “Give up your livestock, and I will give you food in exchange for your livestock, since the money is gone.” 17So they brought their livestock to Joseph, and he gave them food in exchange for the horses and the flocks and the herds and the donkeys; and he supplied them with food in exchange for all their livestock that year. 18When that year was ended, they came to him the next year and said to him, “We will not hide from my lord [the fact] that our money is spent; my lord also has our herds of livestock; there is nothing left in the sight of my lord but our bodies and our lands. 19“Why should we die before your eyes, both we and our land? Buy us and our land in exchange for food, and we and our land will be servants to Pharaoh. And give us seed [to plant], that we may live and not die, and that the land may not be desolate.”\n\nResult of the Famine 20So Joseph bought all the land of Egypt for Pharaoh; for every Egyptian sold his field because the famine was severe upon them. So the land became Pharaoh’s. 21And as for the people, he relocated them [temporarily] to cities from one end of Egypt’s border to the other. 22Only the land of the priests he did not buy, for the priests had an allotment from Pharaoh, and they lived on the amount which Pharaoh gave them, so they did not sell their land. 23Then Joseph said to the people, “Look, today I have bought you and your land for Pharaoh; now, here is seed for you, and you shall plant the land. 24“At harvest time [when you reap the increase] you shall give one-fifth of it to Pharaoh, and four-fifths will be your own to use for seed for the field and as food for you and those of your households and for your little ones.” 25And they said, “You have saved our lives! Let us find favor in the sight of my lord, and we will be Pharaoh’s servants.” 26And Joseph made it a law over the land of Egypt—valid to this day—that Pharaoh should have the fifth part [of the crops]; only the land of the priests did not become Pharaoh’s.\n\n27Now [the people of] Israel lived in the country of Egypt, in [the land of] Goshen, and they gained possessions and acquired property there and were fruitful and multiplied greatly. 28And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years; so the length of Jacob’s life was a hundred and forty-seven years.\n\n29And when the time drew near for Israel to die, he called his son Joseph and said to him, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please put your hand under my thigh and [promise to] deal loyally and faithfully with me. Please do not bury me in Egypt, 30but when I lie down with my fathers [in death], you will carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place [at Hebron in the cave of Machpelah].” And Joseph said, “I will do as you have directed.” 31Then he said, “Swear to me [that you will do it].” So he swore to him. Then Israel (Jacob) bowed in worship at the head of the bed.\n\nGenesis 48\nIsrael’s Last Days\n\n1Now some time after these things happened, Joseph was told, “Your father is sick.” So he took his two sons Manasseh and Ephraim with him [to go to Goshen]. 2And when Jacob (Israel) was told, “Look now, your son Joseph has come to you,” Israel strengthened himself and sat up on the bed. 3Then Jacob said to Joseph, “God Almighty appeared to me at Luz (Bethel) in the land of Canaan and blessed me, 4and said to me, ‘Behold, I will make you fruitful and numerous, and I will make you a great company of people, and will give this land to your descendants after you as an everlasting possession.’ 5Now your two sons [Ephraim and Manasseh], who were born to you in the land of Egypt before I came to you in Egypt, are mine; Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine [that is, adopted as my heirs and sons as surely], as Reuben and Simeon are my sons. 6But other sons who were born to you after them shall be your own; they shall be called by the names of their [two] brothers in their inheritance. 7“Now as for me, when I came from Paddan [in Mesopotamia], Rachel died beside me in the land of Canaan on the journey, when there was still some distance to go to Ephrath; and I buried her there on the way to Ephrath (that is, Bethlehem).”\n\n8When Israel [who was almost blind] saw Joseph’s sons, he said, “Who are these?” 9Joseph said to his father, “They are my sons, whom God has given me here [in Egypt].” So he said, “Please bring them to me, so that I may bless them.” 10Now Israel’s eyes were so dim from age that he could not see [clearly]. Then Joseph brought them close to him, and he kissed and embraced them. 11Israel said to Joseph, “I never expected to see your face, but see, God has shown me your children as well.” 12Then Joseph took the boys [from his father’s embrace], and he bowed [before him] with his face to the ground. 13Then Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand toward Israel’s left, and Manasseh with his left hand toward Israel’s right, and brought them close to him. 14But Israel reached out his right hand and laid it on the head of Ephraim, who was the younger, and his left hand on Manasseh’s head, crossing his hands [intentionally], even though Manasseh was the firstborn. 15Then Jacob (Israel) blessed Joseph, and said,\n“The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked [in faithful obedience],\nThe God who has been my Shepherd [leading and caring for me] all my life to this day,\n16The Angel [that is, the LORD Himself] who has redeemed me [continually] from all evil,\nBless the boys;\nAnd may my name live on in them [may they be worthy of having their names linked with mine],\nAnd the names of my fathers Abraham and Isaac;\nAnd may they grow into a [great] multitude in the midst of the earth.”\n\n17When Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim’s head, it displeased him [because he was not the firstborn]; and he grasped his father’s hand to move it from Ephraim’s head to Manasseh’s head. 18Joseph said to his father, “Not so, my father, for this is the firstborn; place your right hand on Manasseh’s head.” 19But his father refused and said, “I know, my son, I know; Manasseh also will become a people and he will be great; but his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.” 20Then Jacob blessed them that day, saying,\n“By you Israel will pronounce a blessing, saying,\n‘May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.’”\nAnd he put Ephraim before Manasseh. 21Then Israel said to Joseph, “Behold, I am about to die, but God will be with you, and bring you back to [Canaan] the land of your fathers. 22“Moreover, I have given you [the birthright,] one portion [Shechem, one mountain ridge] more than any of your brothers, which I took [reclaiming it] from the hand of the Amorites with my sword and with my bow.”\n\nGenesis 49\nIsrael’s Prophecy Concerning His Sons\n\n1Then Jacob called for his sons and said, “Assemble yourselves [around me] that I may tell you what will happen to you and your descendants in the days to come.\n2“Gather together and hear, O sons of Jacob;\nAnd listen to Israel (Jacob) your father.\n3“Reuben, you are my firstborn;\nMy might, the beginning of my strength and vigor,\nPreeminent in dignity and preeminent in power [that should have been your birthright].\n4“But unstable and reckless and boiling over like water [in sinful lust], you shall not excel or have the preeminence [of the firstborn],\nBecause you went up to your father’s bed [with Bilhah];\nYou defiled it—he went up to my couch.\n5“Simeon and Levi are brothers [equally headstrong, deceitful, vindictive, and cruel];\nTheir swords are weapons of violence and revenge.\n6“O my soul, do not come into their secret council;\nLet not my glory (honor) be united with their assembly [for I knew nothing of their plot];\nBecause in their anger they killed men [an honored man, Shechem, and the Shechemites],\nAnd in their self-will they lamed oxen.\n7“Cursed be their anger, for it was fierce;\nAnd their wrath, for it was cruel.\nI will divide and disperse them in Jacob,\nAnd scatter them in [the midst of the land of] Israel.\n8“Judah, you are the one whom your brothers shall praise;\nYour hand will be on the neck of your enemies;\nYour father’s sons shall bow down to you.\n9“Judah, a lion’s cub;\nWith the prey, my son, you have gone high up [the mountain].\nHe stooped down, he crouched like a lion,\nAnd like a lion—who dares rouse him?\n10“The scepter [of royalty] shall not depart from Judah,\nNor the ruler’s staff from between his feet,\nUntil Shiloh [the Messiah, the Peaceful One] comes,\nAnd to Him shall be the obedience of the peoples.\n11“Tying his foal to the [strong] vine\nAnd his donkey’s colt to the choice vine,\nHe washes his clothing in wine [because the grapevine produces abundantly],\nAnd his robes in the blood of grapes.\n12“His eyes are darker and sparkle more than wine,\nAnd his teeth whiter than milk.\n13“Zebulun shall dwell at the seashore;\nAnd he shall be a haven (landing place) for ships,\nAnd his flank shall be toward Sidon.\n14“Issachar is [like] a strong-boned donkey,\nCrouching down between the sheepfolds.\n15“When he saw that the resting place was good\nAnd that the land was pleasant,\nHe bowed his shoulder to bear [burdens],\nAnd became a servant at forced labor.\n16“Dan shall judge his people,\nAs one of the tribes of Israel.\n17“Dan shall be a [venomous] serpent in the way,\nA fanged snake in the path,\nThat bites the horse’s heels,\nSo that his rider falls backward.\n18“I wait for Your salvation, O LORD.\n19“As for Gad—a raiding troop shall raid him,\nBut he shall raid at their heels and assault them [victoriously].\n20“Asher’s food [supply] shall be rich and bountiful,\nAnd he shall yield and deliver royal delights.\n21“Naphtali is a doe let loose, [a swift warrior,]\nWhich yields branched antlers (eloquent words).\n22“Joseph is a fruitful bough (a main branch of the vine),\nA fruitful bough by a spring (a well, a fountain);\nIts branches run over the wall [influencing others].\n23“The [skilled] archers have bitterly attacked and provoked him;\nThey have shot [at him] and harassed him.\n24“But his bow remained firm and steady [in the Strength that does not fail],\nFor his arms were made strong and agile\nBy the hands of the Mighty One of Jacob,\n(By the name of the Shepherd, the Stone of Israel),\n25By the God of your father who will help you,\nAnd by the Almighty who blesses you\nWith blessings of the heavens above,\nBlessings lying in the deep that couches beneath,\nBlessings of the [nursing] breasts and of the [fertile] womb.\n26“The blessings of your father\nAre greater than the blessings of my ancestors [Abraham and Isaac]\nUp to the utmost bound of the everlasting hills;\nThey shall be on the head of Joseph,\nEven on the crown of the head of him who was the distinguished one and the one who is prince among (separate from) his brothers.\n27“Benjamin is a ravenous wolf;\nIn the morning he devours the prey,\nAnd at night he divides the spoil.”\n\n28All these are the [beginnings of the] twelve tribes of Israel, and this is what their father said to them as he blessed them, blessing each one according to the blessing appropriate to him. 29He charged them and said to them, “I am to be gathered to my people; bury me with my fathers in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite, 30in the cave in the field at Machpelah, east of Mamre, in the land of Canaan, that Abraham bought, along with the field from Ephron the Hittite, to possess as a burial site. 31There they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife, there they buried Isaac and Rebekah his wife, and there I buried Leah— 32the field and the cave that is in it was purchased from the sons of Heth.” 33When Jacob (Israel) had finished commanding his sons, he drew his feet into the bed and breathed his last, and was gathered to his people [who had preceded him in death].\n\nGenesis 50\nBurial Preparations And Mourning For Jacob\n\n1Then Joseph fell upon his father’s face, and wept over him and kissed him [tenderly]. 2Then Joseph ordered his servants the physicians to embalm (mummify) his father. So the physicians embalmed Israel (Jacob). 3Now forty days were required for this, for that is the customary number of days [of preparation] required for embalming. And the Egyptians wept and grieved for him [in public mourning as they would for royalty] for seventy days.\n\n4When the days of weeping and public mourning for him were past, Joseph spoke to [the nobles of] the house of Pharaoh, saying, “If now I have found favor in your sight, please speak to Pharaoh, saying, 5‘My father made me swear [an oath], saying, “Hear me, I am about to die; bury me in my tomb which I prepared for myself in the land of Canaan.” So now let me go up [to Canaan], please, and bury my father; then I will return.’” 6And Pharaoh said, “Go up and bury your father, as he made you swear.”\n\n7So Joseph went up [to Canaan] to bury his father, and with him went all the officials of Pharaoh, [the nobles of his court and] the elders of his household and all [the nobles and] the elders of the land of Egypt— 8and all the household of Joseph and his brothers and his father’s household. They left only their little ones and their flocks and herds in the land of Goshen. 9Both chariots and horsemen also went up [to Canaan] with Joseph; and it was a very great company. 10When they came to the threshing floor of Atad, which is beyond the Jordan, they mourned there with a great lamentation (expressions of mourning for the deceased) and [extreme demonstrations of] sorrow [according to Egyptian custom]; and Joseph observed a seven-day mourning for his father. 11When the inhabitants of the land, the Canaanites, saw the mourning at the threshing floor of Atad, they said, “This is a grievous mourning for the Egyptians.” Therefore the place was named Abel-mizraim (mourning of Egypt); it is west of the Jordan. Burial at Machpelah 12So Jacob’s sons did for him as he had commanded them; 13for his sons carried him to the land of Canaan and buried him in the cave of the field of Machpelah, east of Mamre, which Abraham bought along with the field as a burial site from Ephron the Hittite. 14After he had buried his father, Joseph returned to Egypt, he and his brothers, and all who had gone up with him.\n\n15When Joseph’s brothers saw that their father was dead, they said, “What if Joseph carries a grudge against us and pays us back in full for all the wrong which we did to him?” 16So they sent word to Joseph, saying, “Your father commanded us before he died, saying, 17‘You are to say to Joseph, “I beg you, please forgive the transgression of your brothers and their sin, for they did you wrong.”’ Now, please forgive the transgression of the servants of the God of your father.” And Joseph wept when they spoke to him. 18Then his brothers went and fell down before him [in confession]; then they said, “Behold, we are your servants (slaves).” 19But Joseph said to them, “Do not be afraid, for am I in the place of God? [Vengeance is His, not mine.] 20As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good in order to bring about this present outcome, that many people would be kept alive [as they are this day]. 21“So now, do not be afraid; I will provide for you and support you and your little ones.” So he comforted them [giving them encouragement and hope] and spoke [with kindness] to their hearts.\n\nDeath of Joseph 22Now Joseph lived in Egypt, he and his father’s household, and Joseph lived a hundred and ten years. 23Joseph saw the third generation of Ephraim’s children; also the children of Machir, the son of Manasseh, were born and raised on Joseph’s knees. 24Joseph said to his brothers, “I am about to die, but God will surely take care of you and bring you up out of this land to the land which He promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob [to give you].” 25Then Joseph made the sons of Israel (Jacob) swear [an oath], saying, “God will surely visit you and take care of you [returning you to Canaan], and [when that happens] you shall carry my bones up from here.” 26So Joseph died, being a hundred and ten years old; and they embalmed him and he was put in a coffin in Egypt."

          "content": "Exodus 1\nIsrael Multiplies In Egypt\n\n1Now these are the names of the sons of Israel who came to Egypt with Jacob; each came with his household: 2Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah; 3Issachar, Zebulun, and Benjamin; 4Dan and Naphtali, Gad, and Asher. 5All the descendants of Jacob were seventy people; Joseph was [already] in Egypt. 6Then Joseph died, and all his brothers and all that generation, 7but the Israelites were prolific and increased greatly; they multiplied and became extremely strong, so that the land was filled with them.\n\n8Now a new king arose over Egypt, who did not know Joseph [nor the history of his accomplishments]. 9He said to his people, “Behold, the people of the sons of Israel are too many and too mighty for us [they greatly outnumber us]. 10“Come, let us deal shrewdly with them, so that they will not multiply and in the event of war, join our enemies, and fight against us and escape from the land.” 11So they set taskmasters over them to oppress them with hard labor. And the sons of Israel built Pithom and Raamses as storage cities for Pharaoh. 12But the more the Egyptians oppressed them, the more they multiplied and expanded, so that the Egyptians dreaded and were exasperated by the Israelites. 13And the Egyptians made the Israelites serve rigorously [forcing them into severe slavery]. 14They made their lives bitter with hard labor in mortar, brick, and all kinds of field work. All their labor was harsh and severe.\n\n15Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named Shiphrah (beauty) and the other named Puah (splendor), 16“When you act as midwives to the Hebrew women and see them on the birthstool, if it is a son, you shall kill him; but if it is a daughter, she shall live.” 17But the midwives feared God [with profound reverence] and did not do as the king of Egypt commanded, but they let the boy babies live. 18So the king of Egypt called for the midwives and said to them, “Why have you done this thing, and allowed the boy babies to live?” 19The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Because the Hebrew women are not like the Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth quickly and their babies are born before the midwife can get to them.” 20So God was good to the midwives, and the people [of Israel] multiplied and became very strong. 21And because the midwives feared God [with profound reverence], He established families and households for them. 22Then Pharaoh commanded all his people, saying, “Every son who is born [to the Hebrews] must be thrown into the Nile, but every daughter you shall keep alive.”\n\nExodus 2\nThe Birth Of Moses\n\n1Now a man of the house of Levi [the priestly tribe] went and took as his wife a daughter of Levi. 2The woman conceived and gave birth to a son; and when she saw that he was [especially] beautiful and healthy, she hid him for three months [to protect him from the Egyptians]. 3When she could no longer hide him, she got him a basket (chest) made of papyrus reeds and covered it with tar and pitch [making it waterproof]. Then she put the child in it and set it among the reeds by the bank of the Nile. 4And his sister [Miriam] stood some distance away to find out what would happen to him.\n\n5Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to bathe at the Nile, and [she, together with] her maidens walked along the river’s bank; she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her maid [to get it], and she brought it to her. 6When she opened it, she saw the child, and behold, the baby was crying. And she took pity on him and said, “This is one of the Hebrews’ children.” 7Then his sister said to Pharaoh’s daughter, “Shall I go and call a wet-nurse from the Hebrew women to nurse the child for you?” 8And Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Go ahead.” So the girl went and called the child’s mother. 9Then Pharaoh’s daughter said to her, “Take this child away and nurse him for me, and I will give you your wages.” So the woman took the child and nursed him. 10And the child grew, and she brought him to Pharaoh’s daughter and he became her son. And she named him Moses, and said, “Because I drew him out of the water.”\n\n11One day, after Moses had grown [into adulthood], it happened that he went to his countrymen and looked [with compassion] at their hard labors; and he saw an Egyptian beating a Hebrew, one of his countrymen. 12He turned to look around, and seeing no one, he killed the Egyptian and hid him in the sand. 13He went out the next day and saw two Hebrew men fighting with each other; and he said to the aggressor, “Why are you striking your friend?” 14But the man said, “Who made you a prince and a judge over us? Do you intend to kill me as you killed the Egyptian?” Then Moses was afraid and said, “Certainly this incident is known.” Moses Escapes to Midian 15When Pharaoh heard about this matter, he tried to kill Moses. Then Moses fled from Pharaoh’s presence and took refuge in the land of Midian, where he sat down by a well.\n\n16Now the priest of Midian had seven daughters; and they came and drew water [from the well where Moses was resting] and filled the troughs to water their father’s flock. 17Then shepherds came and drove them away, but Moses stood up and helped them and watered their flock. 18When they came to Reuel (Jethro) their father, he said, “How is it that you have come back so soon today?” 19They said, “An Egyptian saved us from the shepherds. He even drew water [from the well] for us and watered the flock.” 20Then he said to his daughters, “Where is he? Why have you left the man behind? Invite him to have something to eat.” 21Moses was willing to remain with the man, and he gave Moses his daughter Zipporah [to be his wife]. 22She gave birth to a son, and he named him Gershom (stranger); for he said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.”\n\n23Now it happened after a long time [about forty years] that the king of Egypt died. And the children of Israel (Jacob) groaned and sighed because of the bondage, and they cried out. And their cry for help because of their bondage ascended to God. 24So God heard their groaning and God remembered His covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel). 25God saw the sons of Israel, and God took notice [of them] and was concerned about them [knowing all, understanding all, remembering all].\n\nExodus 3\nThe Burning Bush\n\n1Now Moses was keeping the flock of Jethro (Reuel) his father-in-law, the priest of Midian; and he led his flock to the west side of the wilderness and came to Horeb (Sinai), the mountain of God. 2The Angel of the LORD appeared to him in a blazing flame of fire from the midst of a bush; and he looked, and behold, the bush was on fire, yet it was not consumed. 3So Moses said, “I must turn away [from the flock] and see this great sight—why the bush is not burned up.” 4When the LORD saw that he turned away [from the flock] to look, God called to him from the midst of the bush and said, “Moses, Moses!” And he said, “Here I am.” 5Then God said, “Do not come near; take your sandals off your feet [out of respect], because the place on which you are standing is holy ground.” 6Then He said, “I am the God of your father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” Then Moses hid his face, because he was afraid to look at God.\n\n7The LORD said, “I have in fact seen the affliction (suffering, desolation) of My people who are in Egypt, and have heard their cry because of their taskmasters (oppressors); for I know their pain and suffering. 8So I have come down to rescue them from the hand (power) of the Egyptians, and to bring them up from that land to a land [that is] good and spacious, to a land flowing with milk and honey [a land of plenty]—to the place of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 9Now, behold, the cry of the children of Israel has come to Me; and I have also seen how the Egyptians oppress them. The Mission of Moses 10“Therefore, come now, and I will send you to Pharaoh, and then bring My people, the children of Israel, out of Egypt.” 11But Moses said to God, “Who am I, that I should go to Pharaoh, and that I should bring the children of Israel out of Egypt?” 12And God said, “Certainly I will be with you, and this shall be the sign to you that it is I who have sent you: when you have brought the people out of Egypt, you shall serve and worship God at this mountain.”\n\n13Then Moses said to God, “Behold, when I come to the Israelites and say to them, ‘The God of your fathers (ancestors) has sent me to you,’ and they say to me, ‘What is His name?’ What shall I say to them?” 14God said to Moses, “I AM WHO I AM”; and He said, “You shall say this to the Israelites, ‘I AM has sent me to you.’” 15Then God also said to Moses, “This is what you shall say to the Israelites, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (Israel), has sent me to you.’ This is My Name forever, and this is My memorial [name] to all generations. 16Go, gather the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel together, and say to them, ‘The LORD, the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham, of Isaac, and of Jacob, appeared to me, saying, I am indeed concerned about you and what has been done to you in Egypt. 17“So I said I will bring you up out of the suffering and oppression of Egypt to the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, to a land flowing with milk and honey.”’ 18The elders [of the tribes] will listen and pay attention to what you say; and you, with the elders of Israel, shall go to the king of Egypt and you shall say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has met with us; so now, please, [we ask and plead with you,] let us go on a three days’ journey into the wilderness, so that we may sacrifice to the LORD our God.’ 19But I know that the king of Egypt will not let you go unless [he is forced] by a strong hand. 20So I will reach out My hand and strike Egypt with all My wonders which I shall do in the midst of it; and after that he will let you go. 21And I will grant this people favor and respect in the sight of the Egyptians; therefore, it shall be that when you go, you will not go empty-handed. 22“But every woman shall [insistently] ask her neighbor and any woman who lives in her house, for articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing; and you shall put them on your sons and daughters. In this way you are to plunder the Egyptians [leaving bondage with great possessions that are rightfully yours].”\n\nExodus 4\nMoses Given Powers\n\n1Then Moses answered [the LORD] and said, “What if they will not believe me or take seriously what I say? For they may say, ‘The LORD has not appeared to you.’” 2And the LORD said to him, “What is that in your hand?” And he said, “A staff.” 3Then He said, “Throw it on the ground.” So Moses threw it on the ground, and it became a [living] serpent [like the royal symbol on the crown of Pharaoh]; and Moses ran from it. 4But the LORD said to Moses, “Reach out your hand and grasp it by the tail.” So he reached out his hand and caught it, and it became a staff in his hand— 5[“You shall do this,” said the LORD,] “so that the elders may believe that the LORD, the God of their fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, has [most certainly] appeared to you.”\n\n6The LORD also said to him, “Put your hand into your robe [where it covers your chest].” So he put his hand into his robe, and when he took it out, his hand was leprous, as white as snow. 7Then God said, “Put your hand into your robe again.” So he put his hand back into his robe, and when he took it out, it was restored [and was] like the rest of his body. 8“If they will not believe you or pay attention to the evidence of the first sign, they may believe the evidence of the second sign. 9“But if they will not believe these two signs or pay attention to what you say, you are to take some water from the Nile and pour it on the dry ground; and the water which you take out of the river will turn into blood on the dry ground.”\n\n10Then Moses said to the LORD, “Please, Lord, I am not a man of words (eloquent, fluent), neither before nor since You have spoken to Your servant; for I am slow of speech and tongue.” 11The LORD said to him, “Who has made man’s mouth? Or who makes the mute or the deaf, or the seeing or the blind? Is it not I, the LORD? 12“Now then go, and I, even I, will be with your mouth, and will teach you what you shall say.” 13But he said, “Please my Lord, send the message [of rescue to Israel] by [someone else,] whomever else You will [choose].” Aaron to Speak for Moses 14Then the anger of the LORD was kindled and burned against Moses; He said, “Is there not your brother, Aaron the Levite? I know that he speaks fluently. Also, he is coming out to meet you, and when he sees you, he will be overjoyed. 15You must speak to him and put the words in his mouth; I, even I, will be with your mouth and with his mouth, and I will teach you what you are to do. 16Moreover, he shall speak for you to the people; he will act as a mouthpiece for you, and you will be as God to him [telling him what I say to you]. 17“You shall take in your hand this staff, with which you shall perform the signs [the miracles which prove I sent you].”\n\n18Then Moses went away and returned to Jethro his father-in-law, and said to him, “Please, let me go back so that I may return to my relatives in Egypt, and see if they are still alive.” And Jethro said to Moses, “Go in peace.” 19Then the LORD said to Moses in Midian, “Go back to Egypt, for all the men who were seeking your life [for killing the Egyptian] are dead.” 20So Moses took his wife [Zipporah] and his sons [Gershom and Eliezer] and seated them on donkeys, and returned to the land of Egypt. Moses also took the staff of God in his hand.\n\n21The LORD said to Moses, “When you return to Egypt, see that you perform before Pharaoh all the wonders (miracles) which I have put in your hand, but I will harden his heart and make him stubborn so that he will not let the people go. 22Then you shall say to Pharaoh, ‘Thus says the LORD, Israel is My son, My firstborn. 23“So I say to you, ‘Let My son go so that he may serve Me’; and if you refuse to let him go, behold, I will kill your son, your firstborn.”’”\n\n24Now it happened at the lodging place, that the LORD met Moses and sought to kill him [making him deathly ill because he had not circumcised one of his sons]. 25Then Zipporah took a flint knife and cut off the foreskin of her son and threw it at Moses’ feet, and said, “Indeed you are a husband of blood to me!” 26So He let Moses alone [to recover]. At that time Zipporah said, “You are a husband of blood”—because of the circumcision.\n\n27The LORD said to Aaron, “Go into the wilderness to meet Moses.” So he went and met him at the mountain of God (Sinai) and kissed him. 28Moses told Aaron all the words of the LORD with which He had sent him, and all the signs that He had commanded him to do. 29Then Moses and Aaron went [into Egypt] and assembled all the elders of the Israelites; 30and Aaron said all the words which the LORD had spoken to Moses. Then Moses performed the signs [given to him by God] before the people. 31So the people believed; and when they heard that the LORD was concerned about the Israelites and that He had looked [with compassion] on their suffering, then they bowed their heads and worshiped [the LORD].\n\nExodus 5\nIsrael’s Labor Increased\n\n1Afterward Moses and Aaron came and said to Pharaoh, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘Let My people go, so that they may celebrate a feast to Me in the wilderness.’” 2But Pharaoh said, “Who is the LORD that I should obey His voice to let Israel go? I do not know the LORD, nor will I let Israel go.” 3Then they said, “The God of the Hebrews has met with us. Please, let us go on a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God, so that He does not discipline us with pestilence or with the sword.” 4But the king of Egypt said to Moses and Aaron, “Why do you take the people away from their work? Get back to your burdens!” 5Pharaoh said, “Look, the people of the land are now many, and you would have them stop their work!” 6The very same day Pharaoh gave orders to the [Egyptian] taskmasters in charge of the people and their [Hebrew] foremen, saying, 7“You will no longer give the people straw to make brick as before; let them go and gather straw for themselves. 8But the number of bricks which they were making before, you shall [still] require of them; you are not to reduce it in the least. For they are idle and lazy; that is why they cry, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to our God.’ 9“Let labor be heavier on the men, and let them work [hard] at it so that they will pay no attention to [their God’s] lying words.”\n\n10Then the [Egyptian] taskmasters [in charge] of the people and their [Hebrew] foremen went out and said to the people, “Thus says Pharaoh, ‘I will not give you any straw. 11‘Go, get straw for yourselves wherever you can find it, but your work [quota] will not be reduced in the least.’” 12So the people were scattered throughout the land of Egypt to gather stubble to use for straw. 13And the taskmasters pressured them, saying, “Finish your work, [fulfill] your daily quotas, just as when there was straw [given to you].” 14And the Hebrew foremen, whom Pharaoh’s taskmasters had set over them, were beaten and were asked, “Why have you not fulfilled your required quota of making bricks yesterday and today, as before?”\n\n15Then the Hebrew foremen came to Pharaoh and cried, “Why do you deal like this with your servants? 16“No straw is given to your servants, yet they say to us, ‘Make bricks!’ And look, your servants are being beaten, but it is the fault of your own people.” 17But Pharaoh said, “You are lazy, very lazy and idle! That is why you say, ‘Let us go and sacrifice to the LORD.’ 18“Get out now and get to work; for no straw will be given to you, yet you are to deliver the same quota of bricks.” 19The Hebrew foremen saw that they were in a bad situation because they were told, “You must not reduce [in the least] your daily quota of bricks.” 20When they left Pharaoh’s presence, the foremen met Moses and Aaron, who were waiting for them. 21And the foremen said to them, “May the LORD look upon you and judge you, because you have made us odious (something hated) in the sight of Pharaoh and his servants, and you have put a sword in their hand to kill us.”\n\n22Then Moses turned again to the LORD and said, “O Lord, why have You brought harm and oppression to this people? Why did You ever send me? [I cannot understand Your purpose!] 23“Ever since I came to Pharaoh to speak in Your name, he has harmed and oppressed this people, and You have done nothing at all to rescue Your people.”\n\nExodus 6\nGod Promises Action\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now you shall see what I will do to Pharaoh; for under compulsion he will [not only] let them go, but under compulsion he will drive them out of his land.”\n\n2Then God spoke further to Moses and said to him, “I am the LORD. 3I appeared to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob (Israel) as God Almighty [El Shaddai], but by My name, LORD, I did not make Myself known to them [in acts and great miracles]. 4I also established My covenant with them, to give them the land of Canaan, the land in which they lived as strangers (temporary residents, foreigners). 5And I have also heard the groaning of the sons of Israel, whom the Egyptians have enslaved, and I have [faithfully] remembered My covenant [with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob]. 6Therefore, say to the children of Israel, ‘I am the LORD, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will free you from their bondage. I will redeem and rescue you with an outstretched (vigorous, powerful) arm and with great acts of judgment [against Egypt]. 7‘Then I will take you for My people, and I will be your God; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God, who redeemed you and brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. 8‘I will bring you to the land which I swore to give to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel); and I will give it to you as a possession. I am the LORD [you have the promise of My changeless omnipotence and faithfulness].’” 9Moses told this to the Israelites, but they did not listen to him because of their impatience and despondency, and because of their forced labor.\n\n10The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 11“Go, tell Pharaoh king of Egypt to let the children of Israel go out of his land.” 12But Moses said to the LORD, “Look, [my own people] the Israelites have not listened to me; so how then will Pharaoh listen to me, for I am unskilled and inept in speech?” 13Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, and gave them a command concerning the Israelites and Pharaoh king of Egypt, to bring the Israelites out of the land of Egypt.\n\nThe Heads of Israel 14These are the heads of their fathers’ households. The sons of Reuben, Israel’s (Jacob’s) firstborn: Hanoch and Pallu, Hezron and Carmi; these are the families of Reuben. 15The sons of Simeon: Jemuel, Jamin, Ohad, Jachin, Zohar, and Shaul the son of a Canaanite woman; these are the families of Simeon. 16These are the names of the sons of Levi according to their births: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari; and Levi lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. 17The sons of Gershon: Libni and Shimei, by their families. 18The sons of Kohath: Amram (Moses’ father), Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; and Kohath lived a hundred and thirty-three years. 19The sons of Merari: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of Levi according to their generations. 20Amram married his father’s sister Jochebed, and she gave birth to Aaron and Moses; and Amram lived a hundred and thirty-seven years. 21The sons of Izhar: Korah, Nepheg, and Zichri. 22The sons of Uzziel: Mishael, Elzaphan, and Sithri. 23Aaron married Elisheba, the daughter of Amminadab and the sister of Nahshon, and she gave birth to Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 24The sons of Korah: Assir, Elkanah, and Abiasaph. These are the [extended] families of the Korahites. 25Eleazar, Aaron’s son, married one of the daughters of Putiel, and she gave birth to Phinehas. These are the heads of the fathers’ households of the Levites by their families. 26These are [the same] Aaron and Moses to whom the LORD said, “Bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt by their armies.” 27They were the ones who spoke to Pharaoh king of Egypt about bringing the Israelites out of Egypt; these are [the same] Moses and Aaron.\n\n28Now it happened on the day when the LORD spoke to Moses in the land of Egypt, 29that He said, “I am the LORD; tell Pharaoh king of Egypt everything that I say to you.” 30But Moses said before the LORD, “Look, I am unskilled and inept in speech; how then will Pharaoh listen to me and pay attention to what I say?”\n\nExodus 7\n“I Will Stretch Out My Hand”\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Now hear this: I make you as God to Pharaoh [to declare My will and purpose to him]; and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet. 2You shall speak all that I command you, and your brother Aaron shall tell Pharaoh to let the children of Israel go out of his land. 3And I will make Pharaoh’s heart hard, and multiply My signs and My wonders (miracles) in the land of Egypt. 4But Pharaoh will not listen to you, and I shall lay My hand on Egypt and bring out My hosts [like a defensive army, tribe by tribe], My people the children of Israel, out of the land of Egypt by great acts of judgment (the plagues). 5“The Egyptians shall know that I am the LORD, when I stretch out My hand on Egypt and bring out the children of Israel from among them.” 6And Moses and Aaron did so; just as the LORD commanded them, so they did. 7Now Moses was eighty years old and Aaron eighty-three years old when they spoke to Pharaoh.\n\nAaron’s Rod Becomes a Serpent 8Now the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, 9“When Pharaoh says to you, ‘Work a miracle [to prove your authority],’ then you say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and throw it down before Pharaoh, so that it may become a serpent.’” 10So Moses and Aaron came to Pharaoh, and did just as the LORD had commanded; Aaron threw down his staff before Pharaoh and his servants, and it became a serpent. 11Then Pharaoh called for the wise men [skilled in magic and omens] and the sorcerers [skilled in witchcraft], and they also, these magicians (soothsayer-priests) of Egypt, did the same with their secret arts and enchantments. 12For every man threw down his staff and they turned into serpents; but Aaron’s staff swallowed up their staffs. 13Yet Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.\n\nWater Is Turned to Blood 14Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh’s heart is hard; he refuses to let the people go. 15Go to Pharaoh in the morning as he is going out to the water, and wait for him on the bank of the Nile; and you shall take in your hand the staff that was turned into a serpent. 16“You shall say to him, ‘The LORD, the God of the Hebrews, has sent me to you, saying, “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me in the wilderness. But behold, you have not listened until now.” 17‘Thus says the LORD, By this you shall know and recognize and acknowledge that I am the LORD: look, with the staff in my hand I will strike the water in the Nile, and it shall be turned to blood. 18“The fish in the Nile will die, and the Nile will become foul, and the Egyptians will not be able to drink water from the Nile.”’” 19Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Take your staff and stretch out your hand over the waters of Egypt, over their rivers, over their streams, over their pools, and over all their reservoirs of water, so that they may become blood; and there shall be blood throughout all the land of Egypt, in containers both of wood and of stone.’”\n\n20So Moses and Aaron did as the LORD commanded; Aaron lifted up the staff and struck the waters in the Nile, in the sight of Pharaoh and in the sight of his servants, and all the water that was in the Nile was turned into blood. 21The fish in the Nile died, and the river became foul smelling, and the Egyptians could not drink its water, and there was blood throughout all the land of Egypt. 22But the magicians of Egypt did the same by their secret arts and enchantments; so Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not listen to Moses and Aaron, just as the LORD had said. 23Then Pharaoh turned and went into his house, and he did not take even this [divine sign] to heart. 24So all the Egyptians dug near the river for water to drink, because they could not drink the water of the Nile. 25Seven days passed after the LORD had struck the Nile.\n\nExodus 8\nFrogs Over The Land\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. 2However, if you refuse to let them go, hear this: I am going to strike your entire land with frogs. 3The Nile will swarm with frogs, which will come up and go into your home, into your bedroom and on to your bed, and into the houses of your servants and on your people, and into your ovens and your kneading bowls. 4“So the frogs will come up on you and on your people and all your servants.”’” 5Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your hand with your staff over the rivers, over the streams and canals, over the pools [among the reeds], and make frogs come up on the land of Egypt.’” 6So Aaron stretched out his hand [with his staff] over the waters of Egypt, and the frogs came up and covered the land of Egypt. 7But the magicians (soothsayer-priests) did the same thing with their secret arts and enchantments, and brought up [more] frogs on the land of Egypt.\n\n8Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Plead with the LORD that He may take away the frogs from me and my people; and I will let the people go, so that they may sacrifice to the LORD.” 9And Moses said to Pharaoh, “I am entirely at your service: when shall I plead [with the Lord] for you and your servants and your people, so that the frogs may leave you and your houses and remain only in the Nile?”\n\n10Then Pharaoh said, “Tomorrow.” Moses replied, “May it be as you say, so that you may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that there is no one like the LORD our God. 11“The frogs will leave you and your houses and leave your servants and your people; they will remain only in the Nile.” 12So Moses and Aaron left Pharaoh, and Moses cried out to the LORD [as he had agreed to do] concerning the frogs which God had inflicted on Pharaoh. 13The LORD did as Moses asked, and the frogs died out of the houses, out of the courtyards and villages, and out of the fields. 14So they piled them up in heaps, and the land was detestable and stank. 15But when Pharaoh saw that there was [temporary] relief, he hardened his heart and would not listen or pay attention to them, just as the LORD had said.\n\nThe Plagues of Gnats and Insects 16Then the LORD said to Moses, “Say to Aaron, ‘Stretch out your staff and strike the dust of the ground, and it will become [biting] gnats (lice) throughout the land of Egypt.’” 17They did so; Aaron stretched out his hand with his staff and struck the dust of the earth, and there were [biting] gnats on man and animal. All the dust of the land became gnats through all the land of Egypt. 18The magicians (soothsayer-priests) tried by their secret arts and enchantments to create gnats, but they could not; and there were gnats on man and animal. 19Then the magicians said to Pharaoh, “This is the [supernatural] finger of God.” But Pharaoh’s heart was hardened and he would not listen to them, just as the LORD had said.\n\n20Now the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh as he is coming out to the water [of the Nile], and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. 21For if you do not let My people go, hear this: I will send swarms of [bloodsucking] insects on you and on your servants and on your people and into your houses; and the houses of the Egyptians will be full of swarms of insects, as well as the ground on which they stand. 22But on that day I will separate and set apart the land of Goshen, where My people are living, so that no swarms of insects will be there, so that you may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that I, the LORD, am in the midst of the earth. 23“I will put a division (distinction) between My people and your people. By tomorrow this sign shall be in evidence.”’” 24Then the LORD did so. And there came heavy and oppressive swarms of [bloodsucking] insects into the house of Pharaoh and his servants’ houses; in all the land of Egypt the land was corrupted and ruined because of the [great invasion of] insects.\n\n25Then Pharaoh called for Moses and Aaron and said, “Go, sacrifice to your God [here] in the land [of Egypt].” 26But Moses said, “It is not right [or even possible] to do that, for we will sacrifice to the LORD our God what is repulsive and unacceptable to the Egyptians [that is, animals that the Egyptians consider sacred]. If we sacrifice what is repulsive and unacceptable to the Egyptians, will they not riot and stone us? 27“We must go a three days’ journey into the wilderness and sacrifice to the LORD our God as He commands us.” 28So Pharaoh said, “I will let you go, so that you may sacrifice to the LORD your God in the wilderness; only you shall not go very far away. Plead [with your God] for me.” 29Moses said, “I am going to leave you, and I will urgently petition (pray, entreat) the LORD that the swarms of insects may leave Pharaoh, his servants, and his people tomorrow; only do not let Pharaoh act deceitfully again by not letting the people go to sacrifice to the LORD.”\n\n30So Moses left Pharaoh and prayed to the LORD [on behalf of Pharaoh]. 31The LORD did as Moses asked, and removed the swarms of [bloodsucking] insects from Pharaoh, from his servants and from his people; not one remained. 32But Pharaoh hardened his heart this time also, and he did not let the people go.\n\nExodus 9\nEgyptian Livestock Die\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh and tell him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. 2But if you refuse to let them go and continue to hold them, 3now hear this: the hand of the LORD will fall on your livestock which are out in the field, on the horses, the donkeys, the camels, the herds, and the flocks—a horrible plague shall come. 4“But the LORD will make a distinction between the livestock of Israel and the livestock of Egypt, so that nothing that belongs to the Israelites will die.”’” 5The LORD set a [definite] time, saying, “Tomorrow the LORD will do this thing in the land.” 6And the LORD did this thing the next day, and all [kinds of] the livestock of Egypt died; but of the livestock of the Israelites, not one died. 7Then Pharaoh sent [men to investigate], and not even one of the livestock of the Israelites had died. But the heart of Pharaoh was hardened [and his mind was firmly set], and he did not let the people go.\n\nThe Plague of Boils 8Then the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Take handfuls of soot from the brick kiln, and let Moses throw it toward the sky in the sight of Pharaoh. 9“It will become fine dust over the entire land of Egypt, and it will become boils breaking out in sores on man and animal in all the land [occupied by the Egyptians].” 10So they took soot from the kiln, and stood before Pharaoh; and Moses threw it toward the sky, and it became boils erupting in sores on man and animal. 11The magicians (soothsayer-priests) could not stand before Moses because of the boils, for the boils were on the magicians as well as on all the Egyptians. 12But the LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, and he did not listen or pay attention to them, just as the LORD had told Moses.\n\n13Then the LORD said to Moses, “Get up early in the morning and stand before Pharaoh and say to him, ‘Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews, “Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. 14For this time I will send all My plagues on you [in full force,] and on your servants and on your people, so that you may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that there is no one like Me in all the earth. 15For by now I could have put out My hand and struck you and your people with a pestilence, and you would then have been cut off (obliterated) from the earth. 16But indeed for this very reason I have allowed you to live, in order to show you My power and in order that My name may be proclaimed throughout all the earth. The Plague of Hail 17Since you are still [arrogantly] exalting yourself [in defiance] against My people by not letting them go, 18hear this: tomorrow about this time I will send a very heavy and dreadful hail, such as has not been seen in Egypt from the day it was founded until now. 19“Now therefore send [a message], bring your livestock and whatever you have in the field to safety. Every man and animal that is in the field and is not brought home shall be struck by the hail and shall die.”’” 20Then everyone among the servants of Pharaoh who feared the word of the LORD made his servants and his livestock flee into the houses and shelters; 21but everyone who ignored and did not take seriously the word of the LORD left his servants and his livestock in the field.\n\n22Now the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand [with your staff] toward the sky, so that there may be hail in all the land of Egypt, on man and on animal and on all the vegetation of the field, throughout the land of Egypt.” 23Moses stretched out his staff toward the sky, and the LORD sent thunder and hail, and lightning (fireballs) ran down to the earth and along the ground. And the LORD rained hail on the land of Egypt. 24So there was hail, and lightning (fireballs) flashing intermittently in the midst of the extremely heavy hail, such as had not been in all the land of Egypt since it became a nation. 25The hail struck down everything that was in the field throughout all the land of Egypt, both man and animal; the hail struck and beat down all the plants in the field and shattered every tree in the field. 26Only in the land of Goshen, where the children of Israel lived, was there no hail.\n\n27Then Pharaoh sent for Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “I have sinned this time; the LORD is righteous, and I and my people are wicked. 28“Pray and entreat the LORD, for there has been enough of God’s thunder and hail; I will let you go, and you shall stay here no longer.” 29Moses said to him, “As soon as I leave the city, I will stretch out my hands to the LORD; the thunder will cease and there will be no more hail, so that you may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that the earth is the LORD’S. 30“But as for you and your servants, I know that you do not yet fear the LORD God.” 31(Now the flax and the barley were battered and ruined [by the hail], because the barley was in the ear (ripe, but soft) and the flax was in bud, 32but the wheat and spelt (coarse wheat) were not battered and ruined, because they ripen late in the season.) 33So Moses left the city and Pharaoh, and stretched out his hands to the LORD; then the thunder and hail ceased, and rain no longer poured on the earth. 34But when Pharaoh saw that the rain and the hail and the thunder had ceased, he sinned again and hardened his heart, both he and his servants. 35Pharaoh’s heart was hardened, and he did not let the Israelites go, just as the LORD had said through Moses.\n\nExodus 10\nThe Plague Of Locusts\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go to Pharaoh, for I have hardened his heart and the heart of his servants [making them determined and unresponsive], so that I may exhibit My signs [of divine power] among them, 2and that you may recount and explain in the hearing of your son, and your grandson, what I have done [repeatedly] to make a mockery of the Egyptians—My signs [of divine power] which I have done among them—so that you may know [without any doubt] and recognize [clearly] that I am the LORD.”\n\n3So Moses and Aaron went to Pharaoh and said to him, “Thus says the LORD, the God of the Hebrews: ‘How long will you refuse to humble yourself before Me? Let My people go, so that they may serve Me. 4‘For if you refuse to let My people go, then hear this: tomorrow I will bring [migratory] locusts into your country. 5‘They shall cover the [visible] surface of the land, so that no one will be able to see the ground, and they will eat the rest of what has remained—that is, the vegetation left after the hail—and they will eat every one of your trees that grows in the field; 6your houses and those of all your servants and of all the Egyptians shall be filled with locusts, as neither your fathers nor your grandfathers have seen, from their birth until this day.’” Then Moses turned and left Pharaoh. 7Pharaoh’s servants said to him, “How long shall this man be a trap to us? Let the men go, so that they may serve the LORD their God. Do you not realize that Egypt is destroyed?” 8So Moses and Aaron were brought back to Pharaoh, and he said to them, “Go, serve the LORD your God! Who specifically are the ones that are going?” 9Moses said, “We will go with our young and our old, with our sons and our daughters, with our flocks and our herds [all of us and all that we have], for we must hold a feast to the LORD.” 10Pharaoh said to them, “The LORD be with you [to help you], if I ever let you go with your children [because you will never return]! Look [be forewarned], you have an evil plan in mind. 11“No! Go now, you who are men, [without your families] and serve the LORD, if that is what you want.” So Moses and Aaron were driven from Pharaoh’s presence.\n\n12Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the land of Egypt for the locusts, so that they may come up on the land of Egypt and eat all the plants of the land, all that the hail has left.” 13So Moses stretched out his staff over the land of Egypt, and the LORD brought an east wind on the land all that day and all that night; when it was morning, the east wind had brought the [swarms of] locusts. 14The locusts came up over all the land of Egypt and settled down in the whole territory, a very dreadful mass of them; never before were there such locusts as these, nor will there ever be again. 15For they covered the [visible] surface of the land, so that the ground was darkened; and they ate every plant of the land and all the fruit of the trees which the hail had left. There remained not a green thing on the trees or the plants of the field throughout all the land of Egypt. 16Then Pharaoh hurried to call for Moses and Aaron, and he said, “I have sinned against the LORD your God and against you. 17“Now therefore, please forgive my sin only this once [more], and pray and entreat the LORD your God, so that He will remove this [plague of] death from me.” 18Moses left Pharaoh and entreated the LORD. 19So the LORD shifted the wind to a violent west wind which lifted up the locusts and drove them into the Red Sea; not one locust remained within the border of Egypt. 20But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart [so that it was even more resolved and obstinate], and he did not let the Israelites go.\n\nDarkness over the Land 21Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand toward the sky, so that darkness may come over the land of Egypt, a darkness which [is so awful that it] may be felt.” 22So Moses stretched out his hand toward the sky, and for three days a thick darkness was all over the land of Egypt [no sun, no moon, no stars]. 23The Egyptians could not see one another, nor did anyone leave his place for three days, but all the Israelites had [supernatural] light in their dwellings. 24Then Pharaoh called to Moses, and said, “Go, serve the LORD; only your flocks and your herds must be left behind. Even your children may go with you.” 25But Moses said, “You must also let us have sacrifices and burnt offerings, so that we may sacrifice them to the LORD our God. 26“Therefore, our livestock must also go with us; not one hoof shall be left behind, for we must take some of them to serve the LORD our God. Even we do not know with what we will serve the LORD until we arrive there.” 27But the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he was not willing to let them go. 28Then Pharaoh said to Moses, “Get away from me! See that you never enter my presence again, for on the day that you see my face again you will die!” 29Then Moses said, “You are correct; I will never see your face again!”\n\nExodus 11\nThe Last Plague\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “I will bring yet one more plague on Pharaoh and on Egypt; after that he will let you go. When he lets you go, he will most certainly drive you out of here completely. 2“Speak so that all of the people [of Israel] may hear, and tell every man to ask from his neighbor, and every woman to ask from her neighbor, articles of silver, and articles of gold.” 3The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians. Moreover, the man Moses was greatly esteemed in the land of Egypt, [both] in the sight of Pharaoh’s servants and in the sight of the people.\n\n4Then Moses said, “Thus says the LORD: ‘At midnight I am going out into the midst of Egypt, 5and all the firstborn in the land [the pride, hope, and joy] of Egypt shall die, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on his throne, to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the hand-mill, and all the firstborn of cattle as well. 6‘There shall be a great cry [of heartache and sorrow] throughout the land of Egypt, such as has never been before and such as shall never be again. 7‘But not even a dog will threaten any of the Israelites, whether man or animal, so that you may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge how the LORD makes a distinction between Egypt and Israel.’ 8“All these servants of yours will come down to me and bow down before me, saying, ‘Get out, you and all the people who follow you.’ After that I will leave.” And he left Pharaoh in the heat of anger.\n\n9Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pharaoh will not listen to you, so that My wonders (miracles) may be multiplied in the land of Egypt.” 10Moses and Aaron did all these wonders (miracles) before Pharaoh; yet the LORD hardened Pharaoh’s heart, and he did not let the Israelites go out of his land.\n\nExodus 12\nThe Passover Lamb\n\n1The LORD said to Moses and Aaron in the land of Egypt, 2“This month shall be the beginning of months to you; it is to be the first month of the year to you. 3Tell all the congregation of Israel, ‘On the tenth [day] of this month they are to take a lamb or young goat for themselves, according to [the size of] the household of which he is the father, a lamb or young goat for each household. 4‘Now if the household is too small for a lamb [to be consumed], let him and his next door neighbor take one according to the number of people [in the households]; according to what each man can eat, you are to divide the lamb. 5‘Your lamb or young goat shall be [perfect] without blemish or bodily defect, a male a year old; you may take it from the sheep or from the goats. 6‘You shall keep it until the fourteenth day of the same month, then the whole assembly of the congregation of Israel is to slaughter it at twilight. 7‘Moreover, they shall take some of the blood and put it on the two doorposts and on the lintel [above the door] of the houses in which they eat it. 8‘They shall eat the meat that same night, roasted in fire, and they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 9‘Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water, but roasted in fire—both its head and its legs, along with its inner parts. 10‘You shall let none of the meat remain until the morning, and anything that remains left over until morning, you shall burn completely in the fire. 11‘Now you are to eat it in this manner: [be prepared for a journey] with your loins girded [that is, with the outer garment tucked into the band], your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your hand; you shall eat it quickly—it is the LORD’S Passover. 12‘For I [the LORD] will pass through the land of Egypt on this night, and will strike down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, both man and animal; against all the gods of Egypt I will execute judgments [exhibiting their worthlessness]. I am the LORD. 13‘The blood shall be a sign for you on [the doorposts of] the houses where you live; when I see the blood I shall pass over you, and no affliction shall happen to you to destroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.\n\nFeast of Unleavened Bread 14‘Now this day will be a memorial to you, and you shall keep it as a feast to the LORD; throughout your generations you are to celebrate it as an ordinance forever. 15‘[In the celebration of the Passover in future years,] seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, but on the first day you shall remove the leaven from your houses [because it represents the spread of sin]; for whoever eats leavened bread on the first day through the seventh day, that person shall be cut off and excluded from [the atonement made for] Israel. 16‘On the first day [of the feast] you shall have a holy and solemn assembly, and on the seventh day there shall be another holy and solemn assembly; no work of any kind shall be done on those days, except for the preparation of food which every person must eat—only that may be done by you. 17‘You shall also observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread, because on this very day I brought your hosts [grouped according to tribal armies] out of the land of Egypt; therefore you shall observe this day throughout your generations as an ordinance forever. 18‘In the first month, on the fourteenth day of the month at evening, you shall eat unleavened bread, [and continue] until the twenty-first day of the month at evening. 19‘Seven days no leaven shall be found in your houses; whoever eats what is leavened shall be cut off and excluded from [the atonement made for] the congregation of Israel, whether a stranger or native-born. 20‘You shall eat nothing leavened; in all your dwellings you shall eat unleavened bread.’”\n\n21Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel and said to them, “Go and take a lamb for yourselves according to [the size of] your families and slaughter the Passover lamb. 22You shall take a bunch of hyssop, dip it in the blood which is in the basin, and touch some of the blood to the lintel [above the doorway] and to the two doorposts; and none of you shall go outside the door of his house until morning. A Memorial of Redemption 23For the LORD will pass through to strike the Egyptians; and when He sees the blood on the lintel [above the entry way] and on the two doorposts, the LORD will pass over the door and will not allow the destroyer to come into your houses to slay you. 24You shall observe this event [concerning Passover] as an ordinance for you and for your children forever. 25When you enter the land which the LORD will give you, as He has promised, you shall keep and observe this service. 26When your children say to you, ‘What does this service mean to you?’ 27you shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the LORD’S Passover, for He passed over the houses of the Israelites in Egypt when He struck the Egyptians, but spared our houses.’” And the people bowed [their heads] low and worshiped [God].\n\n28Then the Israelites went and did [as they had been told]: just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron, so they did.\n\n29Now it happened at midnight that the LORD struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sat on his throne to the firstborn of the prisoner who was in the dungeon, and all the firstborn of the cattle. 30Pharaoh got up in the night, he and all his servants and all the Egyptians, and there was a great cry [of heartache and sorrow] in Egypt, for there was no house where there was not someone dead. 31Then he called for Moses and Aaron at night and said, “Get up, get out from among my people, both you and the Israelites; and go, serve the LORD, as you said. 32“Take both your flocks and your herds, as you have said, and go, and [ask your God to] bless me also.” Exodus of Israel 33The Egyptians [anxiously] urged the people [to leave], to send them out of the land quickly, for they said, “We will all be dead.” 34So the people took their dough before it was leavened, their kneading bowls being bound up in their clothes on their shoulders.\n\n35Now the Israelites had acted in accordance with the word of Moses; and they had asked the Egyptians for articles of silver and articles of gold, and clothing. 36The LORD gave the people favor in the sight of the Egyptians, so that they gave them what they asked. And so they plundered the Egyptians [of those things].\n\n37Now the Israelites journeyed from Rameses to Succoth, about six hundred thousand men on foot, besides [the women and] the children. 38A mixed multitude [of non-Israelites from foreign nations] also went with them, along with both flocks and herds, a very large number of livestock. 39And they baked unleavened cakes of the dough which they brought from Egypt; it was not leavened, since they were driven [quickly] from Egypt and could not delay, nor had they prepared any food for themselves.\n\n40Now the period of time the children of Israel lived in Egypt was four hundred and thirty years. 41At the end of the four hundred and thirty years, to that very day, all the hosts of the LORD [gathered into tribal armies] left the land of Egypt. Ordinance of the Passover 42It is a night of watching to be observed for the LORD for having brought them out of the land of Egypt; this [same] night is for the LORD, to be observed and celebrated by all the Israelites throughout their generations.\n\n43The LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “This is the ordinance of the Passover: no foreigner is to eat it; 44but every man’s slave who is bought with money, after you have circumcised him, then he may eat it. 45No stranger (temporary resident, foreigner) or hired servant shall eat it. 46It is to be eaten inside one house; you shall not take any of the meat outside the house, nor shall you break any of its bones. 47The entire congregation of Israel shall keep and celebrate it. 48If a stranger living temporarily among you wishes to celebrate the Passover to the LORD, all his males must be circumcised, and then he may participate and celebrate it like one that is born in the land. But no uncircumcised person may eat it. 49“The same law shall apply to the native-born and to the stranger who lives temporarily among you.”\n\n50Then all the Israelites did so; they did just as the LORD had commanded Moses and Aaron. 51And on that very same day the LORD brought the Israelites out of the land of Egypt by their hosts (tribal armies).\n\nExodus 13\nConsecration Of The Firstborn\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Sanctify to Me [that is, set apart for My purpose] every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of animal; it is Mine.”\n\n3Moses said to the people, “Remember [solemnly observe and commemorate] this day on which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of bondage and slavery; for by a strong and powerful hand the LORD brought you out of this place. And nothing leavened shall be eaten. 4On this day in the month Abib, you are about to go onward. 5And it shall be when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, which He swore to your fathers to give you, a land [of abundance] flowing with milk and honey, that you shall keep and observe this rite (service) in this month. 6For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a feast to the LORD. 7Unleavened bread shall be eaten throughout the seven days; no leavened bread shall be seen with you, nor shall there be leaven within the borders of your territory. 8You shall explain this to your son on that day, saying, ‘It is because of what the LORD did for me when I came out of Egypt.’ 9It shall serve as a sign to you on your hand (arm), and as a reminder on your forehead, so that the instruction (law) of the LORD may be in your mouth; for with a strong and powerful hand the LORD brought you out of Egypt. 10Therefore, you shall keep this ordinance at this time from year to year.\n\n11“Now it shall be when the LORD brings you into the land of the Canaanite, as He swore to you and your fathers, and gives it to you, 12you shall set apart and dedicate to the LORD all that first opens the womb. All the firstborn males of your livestock shall be the LORD’S. 13“Every firstborn of a donkey you shall redeem by [substituting] a lamb [as a sacrifice for it], but if you do not [wish to] redeem it, then you shall break its neck; and every firstborn among your sons you shall redeem [that is, “buy back” from God with a suitable sacrifice]. 14And it shall be when your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What does this mean?’ you shall say to him, ‘With a strong and powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt, from the house of bondage and slavery. 15‘For it happened, when Pharaoh stubbornly refused to let us go, that the LORD struck every firstborn in the land of Egypt, both the firstborn of man and the firstborn of animal. Therefore, I sacrifice to the LORD all the males, the first [to be born] of every womb, but every firstborn of my sons I redeem.’ 16“So it shall serve as a sign and a reminder on your [left] hand (arm) and as frontlets between your eyes, for by a strong and powerful hand the LORD brought us out of Egypt.”\n\nGod Leads the People 17So it happened, when Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by way of the land of the Philistines, even though it was nearer; for God said, “The people might change their minds when they see war [that is, that there will be war], and return to Egypt.” 18But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea; the sons of Israel went up in battle array (orderly ranks, marching formation) out of the land of Egypt. 19Moses took the bones of Joseph with him, for Joseph had solemnly ordered (placed under an oath) the Israelites, saying, “God will assuredly take care of you, and you must carry my bones away from here with you.” 20They journeyed from Succoth [in Goshen] and camped at Etham on the edge of the wilderness. 21The [presence of the] LORD was going before them by day in a pillar (column) of cloud to lead them along the way, and in a pillar of fire by night to give them light, so that they could travel by day and by night. 22He did not withdraw the pillar of cloud by day, nor the pillar of fire by night, from going before the people.\n\nExodus 14\nPharaoh In Pursuit\n\n1Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Tell the sons of Israel to turn back and camp in front of Pi-hahiroth, between Migdol and the sea. You shall camp in front of Baal-zephon, opposite it, by the sea. 3For Pharaoh will say of the Israelites, ‘They are wandering aimlessly in the land; the wilderness has shut them in.’ 4“I will harden (make stubborn, defiant) Pharaoh’s heart, so that he will pursue them; and I will be glorified and honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and the Egyptians shall know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that I am the LORD.” And they did so.\n\n5When the king of Egypt was told that the people had fled, Pharaoh and his servants had a change of heart toward the people, and they said, “What is this that we have done? We have let Israel go from serving us!” 6So Pharaoh harnessed horses to his war-chariots [for battle] and took his army with him; 7and he took six hundred chosen war-chariots, and all the other war-chariots of Egypt with fighting charioteers over all of them. 8The LORD hardened the heart of Pharaoh, king of Egypt, and he pursued the Israelites, as they were leaving confidently and defiantly. 9The Egyptians chased them with all the horses and war-chariots of Pharaoh, his horsemen and his army, and they overtook them as they camped by the sea, beside Pi-hahiroth, in front of Baal-zephon.\n\n10As Pharaoh approached, the Israelites looked up and saw the Egyptians marching after them, and they were very frightened; so the Israelites cried out to the LORD. 11Then they said to Moses, “Is it because there are no graves in Egypt that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What is this that you have done to us by bringing us out of Egypt? 12“Did we not say to you in Egypt, ‘Leave us alone; let us serve the Egyptians?’ For it would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians [as slaves] than to die in the wilderness.” The Sea Is Divided 13Then Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid! Take your stand [be firm and confident and undismayed] and see the salvation of the LORD which He will accomplish for you today; for those Egyptians whom you have seen today, you will never see again. 14“The LORD will fight for you while you [only need to] keep silent and remain calm.”\n\n15The LORD said to Moses, “Why do you cry to Me? Tell the sons of Israel to move forward [toward the sea]. 16As for you, lift up your staff and stretch out your hand over the sea and divide it, so that the sons of Israel may go through the middle of the sea on dry land. 17As for Me, hear this: I will harden the hearts of the Egyptians, and they will go in [the sea] after them; and I will be glorified and honored through Pharaoh and all his army, and his war-chariots and his horsemen. 18“And the Egyptians shall know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that I am the LORD, when I am glorified and honored through Pharaoh, through his war-chariots and his charioteers.”\n\n19The angel of God, who had been going in front of the camp of Israel, moved and went behind them. The pillar of the cloud moved from in front and stood behind them. 20So it came between the camp of Egypt and the camp of Israel. It was a cloud along with darkness [even by day to the Egyptians], but it gave light by night [to the Israelites]; so one [army] did not come near the other all night.\n\n21Then Moses stretched out his hand over the sea; and the LORD swept the sea back by a strong east wind all that night and turned the seabed into dry land, and the waters were divided. 22The Israelites went into the middle of the sea on dry land, and the waters formed a wall to them on their right hand and on their left. 23Then the Egyptians pursued them into the middle of the sea, even all Pharaoh’s horses, his war-chariots and his charioteers. 24So it happened at the early morning watch [before dawn], that the LORD looked down on the army of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire and cloud and put them in a state of confusion. 25He made their chariot wheels hard to turn, and the chariots difficult to drive; so the Egyptians said, “Let us flee from Israel, for the LORD is fighting for them against the Egyptians.”\n\n26Then the LORD said to Moses, “Stretch out your hand over the sea so that the waters may come back over the Egyptians, on their war-chariots and their charioteers.” 27So Moses stretched out his hand over the sea, and the sea returned to its normal flow at sunrise; and the Egyptians retreated right into it [being met by the returning water]; so the LORD overthrew the Egyptians and tossed them into the midst of the sea. 28The waters returned and covered the chariots and the charioteers, and all the army of Pharaoh that had gone into the sea after them; not even one of them survived. 29But the Israelites walked on dry land in the middle of the sea, and the waters formed a wall to them on their right hand and on their left.\n\n30The LORD saved Israel that day from the hand of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians [lying] dead on the seashore. 31When Israel saw the great power which the LORD had used against the Egyptians, they feared the LORD [with reverence and awe-filled respect], and they believed in the LORD, and in His servant Moses.\n\nExodus 15\nThe Song Of Moses And Israel\n\n1Then Moses and the children of Israel sang this song to the LORD, singing,\n“I will sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously;\nThe horse and its rider He has thrown into the sea.\n2“The LORD is my strength and my song,\nAnd He has become my salvation;\nThis is my God, and I will praise Him;\nMy father’s God, and I will exalt Him.\n3“The LORD is a warrior;\nThe LORD is His name.\n4“Pharaoh’s chariots and his army He has thrown into the sea;\nHis chosen captains are drowned in the Red Sea.\n5“The deep [water] covers them;\n[Clad in armor] they sank into the depths like a stone.\n6“Your right hand, O LORD, is glorious in power;\nYour right hand, O LORD, shatters the enemy.\n7“In the greatness of Your majesty You overthrow and annihilate those [adversaries] who rise [in rebellion] against You;\nYou send out Your fury, and it consumes them like chaff.\n8“With the blast of Your nostrils the waters piled up,\nThe flowing waters stood up like a mound;\nThe deeps were congealed in the heart of the sea.\n9“The enemy said, ‘I will pursue, I will overtake, I will divide the spoil;\nMy desire shall be satisfied against them;\nI will draw my sword, my hand shall dispossess them and drive them out.’\n10“You blew with Your wind, the sea covered them;\n[Clad in armor] they sank like lead in the mighty waters.\n11“Who is like You among the gods, O LORD?\nWho is like You, majestic in holiness,\nAwesome in splendor, working wonders?\n12“You stretched out Your right hand,\nThe sea swallowed them.\n13“You in Your lovingkindness and goodness have led the people whom You have redeemed;\nIn Your strength You have guided them with care to Your holy habitation.\n14“The peoples have heard [about You], they tremble;\nAnguish and fear has gripped the inhabitants of Philistia.\n15“Then the [tribal] chiefs of Edom were dismayed and horrified;\nThe [mighty] leaders of Moab, trembling grips them;\nAll the inhabitants of Canaan have melted away [in despair]—\n16Terror and dread fall on them;\nBecause of the greatness of Your arm they are as still as a stone;\nUntil Your people pass by and [into Canaan], O LORD,\nUntil the people pass by whom You have purchased.\n17“You will bring them [into the land of promise] and plant them on the mountain (Mt. Moriah in Jerusalem) of Your inheritance,\nThe place, O LORD, You have made for Your dwelling [among them],\nThe sanctuary, O Lord, which Your hands have established.\n18“The LORD shall reign to eternity and beyond.”\n\n19For the horses of Pharaoh went with his war-chariots and his charioteers into the sea, and the LORD brought back the waters of the sea on them, but the sons of Israel walked on dry land in the middle of the sea.\n\n20Then Miriam the prophetess, the sister of Aaron [and Moses], took a timbrel in her hand, and all the women followed her with timbrels and dancing. 21Miriam answered them,\n“Sing to the LORD, for He has triumphed gloriously and is highly exalted;\nThe horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.”\n\nThe LORD Provides Water 22Then Moses led Israel from the Red Sea, and they went into the Wilderness of Shur; they went [a distance of] three days (about thirty-three miles) in the wilderness and found no water. 23Then they came to Marah, but they could not drink its waters because they were bitter; therefore it was named Marah (bitter). 24The people [grew discontented and] grumbled at Moses, saying, “What are we going to drink?” 25Then he cried to the LORD [for help], and the LORD showed him a tree, [a branch of] which he threw into the waters, and the waters became sweet.\n\nThere the LORD made a statute and an ordinance for them, and there He tested them, 26saying, “If you will diligently listen and pay attention to the voice of the LORD your God, and do what is right in His sight, and listen to His commandments, and keep [foremost in your thoughts and actively obey] all His precepts and statutes, then I will not put on you any of the diseases which I have put on the Egyptians; for I am the LORD who heals you.”\n\n27Then the children of Israel came to Elim where there were twelve springs of water and seventy date palms, and they camped there beside the waters.\n\nExodus 16\nThe LORD Provides Manna\n\n1They set out from Elim, and all the congregation of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elim and Sinai, on the fifteenth day of the second month after they left the land of Egypt. 2The whole congregation of the Israelites [grew discontented and] murmured and rebelled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness, 3and the Israelites said to them, “Would that we had died by the hand of the LORD in the land of Egypt, when we sat by the pots of meat and ate bread until we were full; for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this entire assembly with hunger.”\n\n4Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will cause bread to rain from heaven for you; the people shall go out and gather a day’s portion every day, so that I may test them [to determine] whether or not they will walk [obediently] in My instruction (law). 5“And it shall be that on the sixth day, they shall prepare to bring in twice as much as they gather daily [so that they will not need to gather on the seventh day].” 6So Moses and Aaron said to all Israel, “At evening you shall know that the LORD has brought you out of the land of Egypt, 7and in the morning you will see the glory of the LORD, for He hears your murmurings against the LORD. What are we, that you murmur and rebel against us?” The LORD Provides Meat 8Moses said, “This will happen when the LORD gives you meat to eat in the evening, and in the morning [enough] bread to be fully satisfied, because the LORD has heard your murmurings against Him; for what are we? Your murmurings are not against us, but against the LORD.”\n\n9Then Moses said to Aaron, “Say to all the congregation of Israel, ‘Approach the LORD, because He has heard your murmurings.’” 10So it happened that as Aaron spoke to the whole congregation of Israel, they looked toward the wilderness, and behold, the glory and brilliance of the LORD appeared in the cloud! 11Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 12“I have heard the murmurings of the Israelites; speak to them, saying, ‘At twilight you shall eat meat, and in the morning you shall be filled with bread; and you shall know that I am the LORD your God.’”\n\n13So in the evening the quails came up and covered the camp, and in the morning there was a blanket of dew around the camp. 14When the layer of dew evaporated, on the surface of the wilderness there was a fine, flake-like thing, as fine as frost on the ground. 15When the Israelites saw it, they said to one another, “What is it?” For they did not know what it was. And Moses said to them, “This is the bread which the LORD has given you to eat. 16“This is what the LORD has commanded: ‘Let every man gather as much of it as he needs. Take an omer for each person, according to the number of people each of you has in his tent.’” 17The Israelites did so, and some gathered much [of it] and some [only a] little. 18When they measured it with an omer, he who had gathered a large amount had no excess, and he who had gathered little had no lack; every man gathered according to his need (family size). 19Moses said, “Let none of it be left [overnight] until [the next] morning.” 20But they did not listen to Moses, and some left a supply of it until morning, and it bred worms and became foul and rotten; and Moses was angry with them. 21So they gathered it every morning, each as much as he needed, because when the sun was hot it melted.\n\nThe Sabbath Observed 22Now on the sixth day they gathered twice as much bread, two omers for each person; and all the leaders of the congregation came and told Moses. 23He said to them, “This is what the LORD has said: ‘Tomorrow is a solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to the LORD’; bake and boil what you will bake and boil [today], and all that remains left over put aside for yourselves to keep until morning.” 24They put it aside until morning, as Moses told them, and it did not become foul nor was it wormy. 25Then Moses said, “Eat that today, for today is a Sabbath to the LORD; today you will not find it in the field. 26“Six days you shall gather it, but on the seventh day, the Sabbath, there will be none [in the field].”\n\n27Now on the seventh day some of the people went out to gather, but they found none. 28Then the LORD said to Moses, “How long do you [people] refuse to keep My commandments and My instructions (laws)? 29“See, the LORD has given you the Sabbath; therefore He gives you the bread for two days on the sixth day. Let every man stay in his place; no man is to leave his place on the seventh day.” 30So the people rested on the seventh day.\n\n31The house of Israel called the bread manna; it was like coriander seed, white, and it tasted like flat pastry (wafers) made with honey. 32Then Moses said, “This is the word which the LORD commands, ‘Let an omer of it be kept throughout your generations, that they may see the bread with which I fed you in the wilderness, when I brought you out of the land of Egypt.’” 33So Moses said to Aaron, “Take a pot and put an omer of manna in it, and place it before the LORD to be kept throughout your generations.” 34As the LORD commanded Moses, so Aaron [eventually] placed it in the presence of the Testimony, to be kept. 35The Israelites ate manna forty years, until they reached an inhabited land; they ate the manna until they came to the border of the land of Canaan. 36(Now an omer is the tenth of an ephah.)\n\nExodus 17\nWater In The Rock\n\n1Then all the congregation of the children of Israel moved on from the Wilderness of Sin by stages, according to the commandment of the LORD, and camped at Rephidim, but there was no water for the people to drink. 2Therefore the people quarreled with Moses and said, “Give us water so we may [have something to] drink.” And Moses said to them, “Why do you quarrel with me? Why do you tempt the LORD and try His patience?” 3But the people were thirsty for water; and the people murmured against Moses and said, “Why did you bring us up from Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst?” 4So Moses cried out to the LORD for help, saying, “What shall I do with this people? They are almost ready to stone me.” 5Then the LORD said to Moses, “Pass before the people and take with you some of the elders of Israel; and take in your hand the staff with which you struck the Nile, and go. 6“Behold, I will stand before you there on the rock at Horeb; there you shall strike the rock, and water will come out of it, so that the people may [have something to] drink.” And Moses did so in the sight of the elders of Israel. 7He named the place [where this miracle occurred] Massah (test) and Meribah (contention) because of the quarreling of the sons of Israel, and because they tested the [patience of the] LORD, saying, “Is the LORD among us, or not?”\n\nAmalek Fought 8Then Amalek [and his people] came and fought with Israel at Rephidim. 9So Moses said to Joshua, “Choose men for us and go out, fight against Amalek [and his people]. Tomorrow I will stand on the top of the hill with the staff of God in my hand.” 10So Joshua did as Moses said, and fought with Amalek; and Moses, Aaron, and Hur went up to the hilltop. 11Now when Moses held up his hand, Israel prevailed, and when he lowered his hand [due to fatigue], Amalek prevailed. 12But Moses’ hands were heavy and he grew tired. So they took a stone and put it under him, and he sat on it. Then Aaron and Hur held up his hands, one on one side and one on the other side; so it was that his hands were steady until the sun set. 13So Joshua overwhelmed and defeated Amalek and his people with the edge of the sword.\n\n14Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write this in the book as a memorial and recite it to Joshua, that I will utterly wipe out the memory of Amalek [and his people] from under heaven.” 15And Moses built an altar and named it The LORD Is My Banner; 16saying, “The LORD has sworn [an oath]; the LORD will have war against [the people of] Amalek from generation to generation.”\n\nExodus 18\nJethro, Moses’ Father-In-Law\n\n1Now Jethro (Reuel), the priest of Midian, Moses’ father-in-law, heard of all that God had done for Moses and for Israel His people, and that the LORD had brought Israel out of Egypt. 2Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took Moses’ wife Zipporah, after he had sent her away [from Egypt], 3along with her two sons, of whom one was named Gershom (stranger), for Moses said, “I have been a stranger in a foreign land.” 4The other [son] was named Eliezer (my God is help), for Moses said, “The God of my father was my help, and He rescued me from the sword of Pharaoh.”\n\n5Then Jethro, his father-in-law, came with Moses’ sons and his wife to [join] Moses in the wilderness where he was camped, at the mountain of God [that is, Mt. Sinai in Horeb]. 6He sent a message to Moses, “I, your father-in-law Jethro, am coming to you with your wife and her two sons [who are] with her.” 7So Moses went out to meet his father-in-law, and he bowed down [in respect] and kissed him. They asked each other about their well-being and went into the tent. 8Moses told his father-in-law about all that the LORD had done to Pharaoh and the Egyptians for Israel’s sake, and about all the hardship that had happened during the journey, and how the LORD had rescued them. 9Jethro rejoiced over all the good things the LORD had done to Israel, in that He had rescued them from the hand of the Egyptians. 10Jethro said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of Pharaoh, and who has rescued the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. 11“Now I know that the LORD is greater than all gods; indeed, it was proven when they acted insolently toward Israel [and the LORD showed Himself infinitely superior to all their gods].” 12Then Jethro, Moses’ father-in-law, took a burnt offering and [other] sacrifices [to offer] to God, and Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat a meal with Moses’ father-in-law before God.\n\n13Now the next day Moses sat to judge [the disputes] the people [had with one another], and the people stood around Moses from dawn to dusk. 14When Moses’ father-in-law saw everything that he was doing for the people, he said, “What is this that you are doing for the people? Why are you sitting alone [as a judge] with all the people standing around you from dawn to dusk?” 15Moses said to his father-in-law, “Because the people come to me to ask [about the will] of God. 16“When they have a dispute they come to me, and I judge between a man and his neighbor and I make known the statutes of God and His laws.” Jethro Counsels Moses 17Moses’ father-in-law said to him, “The thing that you are doing is not good. 18You will certainly wear out both yourself and these people who are with you, because the task is too heavy for you [to bear]; you cannot do it alone. 19Now listen to me; I will advise you, and may God be with you [to confirm my advice]. You shall represent the people before God. You shall bring their disputes and causes to Him. 20You shall teach them the decrees and laws. You shall show them the way they are to live and the work they are to do. 21Furthermore, you shall select from all the people competent men who [reverently] fear God, men of truth, those who hate dishonest gain; you shall place these over the people as leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens. 22They shall judge the people at all times; have them bring every major dispute to you, but let them judge every minor dispute themselves. So it will be easier for you, and they will bear the burden with you. 23“If you will do this thing and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure [the responsibility], and all these people will also go [back] to their tents in peace.”\n\n24So Moses listened to his father-in-law and did everything that he had said. 25Moses chose able men from all Israel and made them heads over the people, leaders of thousands, of hundreds, of fifties and of tens [from the highest to the lowest judicial levels]. 26And they judged the people at all times; they would bring the difficult cases to Moses, but every minor dispute they judged and decided themselves. 27Then Moses said goodbye to his father-in-law, and Jethro went back to his own land (Midian).\n\nExodus 19\nMoses On Sinai\n\n1In the third month after the children of Israel had left the land of Egypt, the very same day, they came into the Wilderness of Sinai. 2When they moved out from Rephidim, they came to the Wilderness of Sinai and they camped there; Israel camped at the base of the mountain [of Sinai]. 3Moses went up to God [on the mountain], and the LORD called to him from the mountain, saying, “Say this to the house of Jacob and tell the Israelites: 4‘You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, and how I carried you on eagles’ wings, and brought you to Myself. 5‘Now therefore, if you will in fact obey My voice and keep My covenant (agreement), then you shall be My own special possession and treasure from among all peoples [of the world], for all the earth is Mine; 6and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation [set apart for My purpose].’ These are the words that you shall speak to the Israelites.”\n\n7So Moses called for the elders of the people, and told them all these words which the LORD commanded him. 8All the people answered together and said, “We will do everything that the LORD has spoken.” And Moses reported the words of the people to the LORD. 9The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, I will come to you in a thick cloud, so that the people may hear when I speak with you and may believe and trust in you forever.” Then Moses repeated the words of the people to the LORD.\n\n10The LORD also said to Moses, “Go to the people and consecrate them today and tomorrow [that is, prepare them for My sacred purpose], and have them wash their clothes 11and be ready by the third day, because on the third day the LORD will come down on Mount Sinai [in the cloud] in the sight of all the people. 12You shall set barriers for the people all around [the mountain], saying, ‘Beware that you do not go up on the mountain or touch its border; whoever touches the mountain must be put to death. 13‘No hand shall touch him [that is, no one shall try to save the guilty party], but the offender must be stoned or shot through [with arrows]; whether man or animal [that touches the mountain], he shall not live.’ When the ram’s horn sounds a long blast, they shall come up to the mountain.” 14So Moses went down from the mountain to the people and sanctified them [for God’s sacred purpose], and they washed their clothes. 15He said to the people, “Be prepared for the third day; do not be intimate with a woman.”\n\n16So it happened on the third day, when it was morning, that there were thunder and flashes of lightning, and a thick cloud was on the mountain, and a very loud blast was sounded on a ram’s horn, so that all the people who were in the camp trembled. 17Then Moses brought the people out of the camp to meet God, and they stood and presented themselves at the foot of the mountain. The LORD Visits Sinai 18Mount Sinai was wrapped in smoke because the LORD descended upon it in fire; its smoke ascended like the smoke of a furnace, and the whole mountain quaked violently. 19And it happened, as the blast of the ram’s horn grew louder and louder, Moses spoke and God answered him with [a voice of] thunder. 20The LORD came down on Mount Sinai, to the top of the mountain; and the LORD called Moses to the top of the mountain, and he went up. 21Then the LORD spoke to Moses, “Go down, warn the people, so that they do not break through [the barriers around the mountain] to the LORD to see [Me], and many of them perish [as a result]. 22“Also have the priests who approach the LORD consecrate (sanctify, set apart) themselves [for My sacred purpose], or else the LORD will break forth [in judgment] against them [and destroy them].” 23Moses said to the LORD, “The people cannot come up to Mount Sinai, because You warned us, saying, ‘Set barriers around the mountain and consecrate it.’” 24Then the LORD said to him, “Go down and come up again, you and Aaron with you; but do not let the priests and the people break through [the barriers] to come up to the LORD, or He will break forth [in judgment] against them [and destroy them].” 25So Moses went down to the people and told them [again about God’s warning].\n\nExodus 20\nThe Ten Commandments\n\n1Then God spoke all these words:\n\n2“I am the LORD your God, who has brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.\n\n3“You shall have no other gods before Me.\n\n4“You shall not make for yourself any idol, or any likeness (form, manifestation) of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth [as an object to worship]. 5You shall not worship them nor serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous (impassioned) God [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely mine], visiting (avenging) the iniquity (sin, guilt) of the fathers on the children [that is, calling the children to account for the sins of their fathers], to the third and fourth generations of those who hate Me, 6but showing graciousness and steadfast lovingkindness to thousands [of generations] of those who love Me and keep My commandments.\n\n7“You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain [that is, irreverently, in false affirmations or in ways that impugn the character of God]; for the LORD will not hold guiltless nor leave unpunished the one who takes His name in vain [disregarding its reverence and its power].\n\n8“Remember the Sabbath (seventh) day to keep it holy (set apart, dedicated to God). 9Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 10but the seventh day is a Sabbath [a day of rest dedicated] to the LORD your God; on that day you shall not do any work, you or your son, or your daughter, or your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock or the temporary resident (foreigner) who stays within your [city] gates. 11For in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, the sea and everything that is in them, and He rested (ceased) on the seventh day. That is why the LORD blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy [that is, set it apart for His purposes].\n\n12“Honor (respect, obey, care for) your father and your mother, so that your days may be prolonged in the land the LORD your God gives you.\n\n13“You shall not commit murder (unjustified, deliberate homicide).\n\n14“You shall not commit adultery.\n\n15“You shall not steal [secretly, openly, fraudulently, or through carelessness].\n\n16“You shall not testify falsely [that is, lie, withhold, or manipulate the truth] against your neighbor (any person).\n\n17“You shall not covet [that is, selfishly desire and attempt to acquire] your neighbor’s house; you shall not covet your neighbor’s wife, or his male servant, or his female servant, or his ox, or his donkey, or anything that belongs to your neighbor.”\n\n18Now all the people witnessed the thunder and the flashes of lightning and the sound of the trumpet and the smoking mountain; and as they looked, the people were afraid, and they trembled [and moved backward] and stood at a [safe] distance. 19Then they said to Moses, “You speak to us and we will listen, but do not let God speak to us or we will die.” 20Moses said to the people, “Do not be afraid; for God has come in order to test you, and in order that the fear of Him [that is, a profound reverence for Him] will remain with you, so that you do not sin.” 21So the people stood at a [safe] distance, but Moses approached the thick cloud where God was.\n\n22Then the LORD said to Moses, “Thus you shall say to the Israelites, ‘You have seen for yourselves that I have spoken to you from heaven. 23‘You shall not make other gods [to worship] besides Me; gods of silver or gods of gold, you shall not make [these lifeless idols] for yourselves. 24‘You shall make an altar of earth for Me, and sacrifice on it your burnt offerings and your peace offerings, your sheep and your oxen. In every place where I cause My Name to be recorded and remembered [through revelation of My divine nature] I will come to you and bless you. 25‘If you make an altar of stone for Me, you shall not build it of cut stones, for if you use a chisel on it, you will profane it. 26‘Nor shall you go up to My altar on steps, so that your nakedness will not be exposed on it.’\n\nExodus 21\nOrdinances For The People\n\n1“Now these are the ordinances (laws) which you shall set before the Israelites:\n\n2“If you purchase a Hebrew servant [because of his debt or poverty], he shall serve six years, and in the seventh [year] he shall leave as a free man, paying nothing. 3If he came [to you] alone, he shall leave alone; if he came married, then his wife shall leave with him. 4If his master gives him a wife, and she gives birth to sons or daughters, the wife and her children shall belong to her master, and he shall leave [your service] alone. 5But if the servant plainly says, ‘I love my master, my wife and my children; I will not leave as a free man,’ 6then his master shall bring him to God [that is, to the judges who act in God’s name], then he shall bring him to the door or doorpost. And his master shall pierce his ear with an awl (strong needle); and he shall serve him for life.\n\n7“If a man sells his daughter to be a female servant, she shall not go free [after six years] as male servants do. 8If she does not please her master who has chosen her for himself [as a wife], he shall let her be redeemed [by her family]. He does not have the authority to sell her to a foreign people, because he has been unfair to her. 9If her master chooses her [as a wife] for his son, he shall act toward her as if she were legally his daughter. 10If her master marries another wife, he may not reduce her food, her clothing, or her privilege as a wife. 11If he does not do these three things for her, then shall she leave free, without payment of money.\n\nPersonal Injuries 12“Whoever strikes a man so that he dies must be put to death. 13However, if he did not lie in wait [for him], but God allowed him to fall into his hand, then I will establish for you a place to which he may escape [for protection until duly tried]. 14But if a man acts intentionally against another and kills him by [design through] treachery, you are to take him from My altar [to which he may have fled for protection], so that he may be put to death.\n\n15“Whoever strikes his father or his mother must be put to death.\n\n16“Whoever kidnaps a man, whether he sells him or is found with him in his possession, must be put to death.\n\n17“Whoever curses his father or his mother or treats them contemptuously must be put to death.\n\n18“If men quarrel and one strikes another with a stone or with his fist, and he does not die but is confined to bed, 19if he gets up and walks around leaning on his cane, then the one who struck him shall be left [physically] unpunished; he must only pay for his loss of time [at work], and the costs [of treatment and recuperation] until he is thoroughly healed.\n\n20“If a man strikes his male or his female servant with a staff and the servant dies at his hand, he must be punished. 21If, however, the servant survives for a day or two, the offender shall not be punished, for the [injured] servant is his own property.\n\n22“If men fight with each other and injure a pregnant woman so that she gives birth prematurely [and the baby lives], yet there is no further injury, the one who hurt her must be punished with a fine [paid] to the woman’s husband, as much as the judges decide. 23But if there is any further injury, then you shall require [as a penalty] life for life, 24eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, 25burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.\n\n26“If a man hits the eye of his male servant or female servant and it is destroyed, he must let the servant go free because of [the loss of] the eye. 27And if he knocks out the tooth of his male servant or female servant, he must let the servant go free because of [the loss of] the tooth.\n\n28“If an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox must be stoned and its meat shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be cleared [of responsibility]. 29But if the ox has tried to gore on a previous occasion, and its owner has been warned, but has not kept it confined and it kills a man or a woman, the ox shall be stoned and its owner shall be put to death as well. 30If a ransom is demanded of him [in return for his life], then he shall give whatever is demanded for the redemption of his life. 31If the ox has gored another’s son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule. 32If the ox gores a male or a female servant, the owner shall give to the servant’s master thirty shekels of silver [the purchase price for a slave], and the ox shall be stoned.\n\n33“If a man leaves a pit open, or digs a pit and does not cover it, and an ox or a donkey falls into it, 34the owner of the pit shall make restitution; he shall give money to the animal’s owner, but the dead [animal] shall be his.\n\n35“If one man’s ox injures another’s so that it dies, then they shall sell the live ox and divide the proceeds equally; they shall also divide the dead ox [between them]. 36Or if it is known that the ox was previously in the habit of goring, and its owner has not kept it confined, he must make restitution of ox for ox, and the dead [animal] shall be his.\n\nExodus 22\nProperty Rights\n\n1“If a man steals an ox or sheep and kills or sells it, he shall make restitution of five oxen for an ox or four sheep for a sheep.\n\n2“If a thief is caught breaking in [after dark] and is struck [by the owner] so that he dies, there shall be no bloodguilt for him. 3But if the sun has risen, there will be bloodguilt for him. The thief [if he lives] must make [full] restitution; if he has nothing, then he shall be sold [as a slave to make restitution] for his theft. 4If the animal that he stole is found alive in his possession, whether it is ox or donkey or sheep, he shall pay double [for it].\n\n5“If a man causes a field or vineyard to be grazed bare or lets his livestock loose so that it grazes in another man’s field, he shall make restitution from the best of his own field and the best of his own vineyard.\n\n6“If fire breaks out and spreads to thorn bushes so that the stacked grain or standing grain or the field is consumed, he who started the fire shall make full restitution.\n\n7“If a man gives his neighbor money or [other] goods to keep [for him while he is away] and it is stolen from the neighbor’s house, then, if the thief is caught, he shall pay double [for it]. 8If the thief is not caught, the owner of the house shall appear before the judges [who act in God’s name], to determine whether or not he had stolen his neighbor’s goods. 9For every offense involving property, whether it concerns ox, donkey, sheep, clothing, or any piece of lost property, which another identifies as his, the case of both parties shall come before the judges [who act in God’s name]. Whomever the judges pronounce guilty shall pay double to his neighbor.\n\n10“If a man gives his neighbor a donkey or an ox or a sheep or any [other] animal to keep [for him], and it dies or is injured or taken away while no one is looking, 11then an oath before the LORD shall be made by the two of them that he has not taken his neighbor’s property; and the owner of it shall accept his word and not require him to make restitution. 12But if it is actually stolen from him [when in his care], he shall make restitution to its owner. 13If it is torn to pieces [by some predator or by accident], let him bring the mangled carcass as evidence; he shall not make restitution for what was torn to pieces.\n\n14“And if a man borrows an animal from his neighbor, and it gets injured or dies while its owner is not with it, the borrower shall make full restitution. 15But if the owner is with it [when the damage is done], the borrower shall not make restitution. If it was hired, the damage is included in [the price of] its fee.\n\nVarious Laws 16“If a man seduces a virgin who is not betrothed, and lies with her, he must pay a dowry (marriage price) for her to be his wife. 17If her father absolutely refuses to give her to him, he must [still] pay money equivalent to the dowry of virgins.\n\n18“You shall not allow a woman who practices sorcery to live.\n\n19“Whoever lies with an animal must be put to death.\n\n20“He who sacrifices to any god, other than to the LORD alone, shall be put under a ban (designated) for destruction (execution).\n\n21“You shall not wrong a stranger or oppress him, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 22You shall not harm or oppress any widow or fatherless child. 23If you harm or oppress them in any way, and they cry at all to Me [for help], I will most certainly hear their cry; 24and My wrath shall be kindled and burn; I will kill you with the sword, and your wives shall become widows and your children fatherless.\n\n25“If you lend money to any one of My people with you who is poor, you shall not act as a creditor (professional moneylender) to him; you shall not charge him interest. 26If you ever take your [poor] neighbor’s robe in pledge, you must return it to him before sunset, 27for that is his only covering; it is his clothing for his body. In what shall he sleep? And when he cries to Me [for help], I will hear him, for I am compassionate and gracious.\n\n28“You shall not curse God, nor curse the ruler of your people [since he administers God’s law].\n\n29“You shall not delay the offering from your harvest and your vintage. You shall give (consecrate, dedicate) to Me the firstborn of your sons. 30You shall do the same with your oxen and with your sheep. It shall be with its mother for seven days; on the eighth day you shall give it [as an offering] to Me.\n\n31“You shall be holy men to Me; therefore you shall not eat meat [from any animal] that has been torn to pieces [by predators] in the field; you shall throw it to the dogs.\n\nExodus 23\nVarious Laws\n\n1“You shall not give a false report; you shall not join hands with the wicked to be a malicious witness [promoting wrong and violence]. 2You shall not follow a crowd to do [something] evil, nor shall you testify at a trial or in a dispute so as to side with a crowd in order to pervert justice; 3nor shall you favor or be partial to a poor man in his dispute [simply because he is poor].\n\n4“If you meet your enemy’s ox or his donkey wandering off, you must bring it back to him. 5If you see the donkey of one who hates you lying helpless under its load, you shall not leave the man to deal with it [alone]; you must help him release the animal [from its burden].\n\n6“You shall not pervert (bend) the justice due to your poor in his dispute. 7Keep far away from a false charge or action, and do not condemn to death the innocent or the righteous, for I will not justify and acquit the guilty.\n\n8“You shall not accept a bribe, for a bribe blinds the clear-sighted and subverts the testimony and the cause of the righteous.\n\n9“You shall not oppress a stranger, for you know the soul [the feelings, thoughts, and concerns] of a stranger, for you were strangers in Egypt.\n\nThe Sabbath and Land 10“You shall sow your land six years and harvest its yield, 11but the seventh year you shall let it rest and lie uncultivated, so that the poor among your people may eat [what the land grows naturally]; whatever they leave the animals of the field may eat. You shall do the same with your vineyard and olive grove.\n\n12“Six days [each week] you shall do your work, but on the seventh day you shall stop [working] so that your ox and your donkey may settle down and rest, and the son of your female servant, as well as your stranger, may be refreshed. 13Now concerning everything which I have said to you, be on your guard; do not mention the name of other gods [either in a blessing or in a curse]; do not let such speech be heard [coming] from your mouth.\n\nThree National Feasts 14“Three times a year you shall celebrate a feast [dedicated] to Me. 15You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib, for in it you came out of Egypt. No one shall appear before Me empty-handed [but you shall bring sacrificial offerings]. 16Also [you shall observe] the Feast of Harvest (Weeks, Pentecost, or First Fruits), acknowledging the first fruits of your labor, of what you sow in the field. And [third] the Feast of Ingathering (Booths or Tabernacles) at the end of the year when you gather in [the fruit of] your labors from the field. 17Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD.\n\n18“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread; and the fat of My feast is not to be left overnight until morning.\n\n19“You shall bring the choice first fruits of your ground into the house of the LORD your God.\n\n“You shall not boil a young goat in its mother’s milk.\n\nConquest of the Land 20“Behold, I am going to send an Angel before you to keep and guard you on the way and to bring you to the place I have prepared. 21Be on your guard before Him, listen to and obey His voice; do not be rebellious toward Him or provoke Him, for He will not pardon your transgression, since My Name (authority) is in Him. 22But if you will indeed listen to and truly obey His voice and do everything that I say, then I will be an enemy to your enemies and an adversary to your adversaries. 23When My Angel goes before you and brings you to [the land of] the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Canaanite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite, I will reject them and completely destroy them. 24You shall not bow down to worship their gods, nor serve them, nor do [anything] in accordance with their practices. You shall completely overthrow them and break down their [sacred] pillars and images [of pagan worship]. 25You shall serve [only] the LORD your God, and He shall bless your bread and water. I will also remove sickness from among you. 26No one shall suffer miscarriage or be barren in your land; I will fulfill the number of your days. 27I will send My terror ahead of you, and I will throw into confusion all the people among whom you come, and I will make all your enemies turn their backs to you [in flight]. 28I will send hornets ahead of you which shall drive out the Hivite, the Canaanite, and the Hittite before you. 29I will not drive them out before you in a single year, so that the land does not become desolate [due to lack of attention] and the [wild] animals of the field do not become too numerous for you. 30I will drive them out before you little by little, until you have increased and are strong enough to take possession of the land. 31I will establish your borders from the Red Sea to the Sea of the Philistines (the Mediterranean), and from the wilderness to the River Euphrates; for I will hand over the residents of the land to you, and you shall drive them out before you. 32You shall not make a covenant with them or with their gods. 33“They shall not live in your land, because they will make you sin against Me; for if you serve their gods, it is certain to be a trap for you [resulting in judgment].”\n\nExodus 24\nPeople Affirm Their Covenant With God\n\n1Then God said to Moses, “Come up to the LORD, you and Aaron, Nadab and Abihu (Aaron’s older sons), and seventy of Israel’s elders, and you shall worship at a [safe] distance. 2“Moses alone shall approach the LORD, but the others shall not come near, nor shall the people come up with him.”\n\n3Then Moses came and told the people everything that the LORD had said and all the ordinances. And all the people answered with one voice, “Everything the LORD has said we will do.” 4Moses wrote down all the words of the LORD. Then he got up early in the morning, and built an altar [for worship] at the foot of the mountain with twelve pillars (memorial stones) representing the twelve tribes of Israel. 5Then he sent young Israelite men, and they offered burnt offerings and sacrificed young bulls as peace offerings to the LORD. 6Moses took half of the blood and put it in large basins, and [the other] half of the blood he sprinkled on the altar. 7Then he took the Book of the Covenant and read it aloud to the people; and they said, “Everything that the LORD has said we will do, and we will be obedient.” 8So Moses took the blood [which had been placed in the large basins] and sprinkled it on the people, and said, “Behold the blood of the covenant, which the LORD has made with you in accordance with all these words.”\n\n9Then Moses, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, and seventy of the elders of Israel went up [the mountainside], 10and they saw [a manifestation of] the God of Israel; and under His feet there appeared to be a pavement of sapphire, just as clear as the sky itself. 11Yet He did not stretch out His hand against the nobles of the Israelites; and they saw [the manifestation of the presence of] God, and ate and drank.\n\n12Now the LORD said to Moses, “Come up to Me on the mountain and stay there, and I will give you the stone tablets with the law and the commandments which I have written for their instruction.” 13So Moses arose with Joshua his attendant, and he went up to the mountain of God. 14And he said to the elders, “Wait here for us until we come back to you. Remember that Aaron and Hur are with you; whoever has a legal matter, let him go to them.” 15Then Moses went up to the mountain, and the cloud covered the mountain. 16The glory and brilliance of the LORD rested on Mount Sinai, and the cloud covered it for six days. On the seventh day God called to Moses from the midst of the cloud. 17In the sight of the Israelites the appearance of the glory and brilliance of the LORD was like consuming fire on the top of the mountain. 18Moses entered the midst of the cloud and went up the mountain; and he was on the mountain forty days and forty nights.\n\nExodus 25\nOfferings For The Sanctuary\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Tell the children of Israel to take an offering for Me. From every man whose heart moves him [to give willingly] you shall take My offering. 3This is the offering you are to receive from them: gold, silver, and bronze, 4blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, fine twisted linen, goats’ hair, 5rams’ skins dyed red, porpoise skins, acacia wood, 6[olive] oil for lighting, balsam for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense, 7onyx stones and setting stones for the [priest’s] ephod and for the breastpiece. 8Have them build a sanctuary for Me, so that I may dwell among them. 9You shall construct it in accordance with everything that I am going to show you, as the pattern of the tabernacle and the pattern of all its furniture.\n\nArk of the Covenant 10“They shall make an ark of acacia wood two and a half cubits long, one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. 11You shall overlay the ark with pure gold, overlay it inside and out, and you shall make a gold border (frame) around its top. 12You shall cast four gold rings for it and attach them to the four feet, two rings on either side. 13You shall make [carrying] poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, 14and put the poles through the rings on the sides of the ark, by which to carry it. 15The poles shall remain in the rings of the ark; they shall not be removed from it [so that the ark itself need not be touched]. 16You shall put into the ark the Testimony (Ten Commandments) which I will give you.\n\n17“You shall make a mercy seat (cover) of pure gold, two and a half cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. 18You shall make two cherubim (winged angelic figures) of [solid] hammered gold at the two ends of the mercy seat. 19Make one cherub at each end, making the cherubim of one piece with the mercy seat at its two ends. 20The cherubim shall have their wings spread upward, covering the mercy seat with their wings and facing each other. The faces of the cherubim are to be looking downward toward the mercy seat. 21You shall put the mercy seat on the top of the ark, and in the ark you shall put the Testimony which I will give you. 22There I will meet with you; from above the mercy seat, from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the Testimony, I will speak [intimately] with you regarding every commandment that I will give you for the Israelites.\n\nThe Table of Bread 23“You shall make a table of acacia wood, two cubits long, one cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high. 24You shall overlay it with pure gold and make a border of gold around the top of it. 25You shall make a rim of a hand width around it; you shall make a gold border for the rim around it. 26You shall make four gold rings for it and fasten them at the four corners that are on the table’s four legs. 27The rings shall be close against the rim as holders for the poles to carry the table. 28You shall make the poles of acacia wood and overlay them with gold, so that the table may be carried with them. 29You shall make its plates [for the showbread] and its cups [for incense] and its pitchers and bowls for sacrificial drink offerings; you shall make them of pure gold. 30You shall set the bread of the Presence (showbread) on the table before Me at all times.\n\nThe Golden Lampstand 31“You shall make a lampstand of pure gold. The lampstand and its base and its shaft shall be made of hammered work; its cups, its calyxes and its flowers shall be all of one piece with it. 32Six branches shall come out of its sides; three branches of the lampstand out of the one side and three branches of the lampstand out of its other side [the shaft being the seventh branch]. 33Three cups shall be made like almond blossoms, each with a calyx and a flower on one branch, and three cups made like almond blossoms on the other branch with a calyx and a flower—so for the six branches coming out of the lampstand; 34and in the [center shaft of the] lampstand [you shall make] four cups shaped like almond blossoms, with their calyxes and their flowers. 35A calyx shall be under the first pair of branches coming out of it, and a calyx under the second pair of branches coming out of it, and a calyx under the third pair of branches coming out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. 36Their calyxes and their branches shall be of one piece with it; all of it shall be one piece of hammered work of pure gold. 37Then you shall make the lamps [of the lampstand] seven in number [with one lamp at the top of the shaft]. The priests shall set up its seven lamps so that they will light the space in front of it. 38Its snuffers and their trays shall be of pure gold. 39It shall be made from a talent (50-80 lbs.) of pure gold, including all these utensils. 40See that you make them [exactly] after their pattern which was shown to you on the mountain.\n\nExodus 26\nCurtains Of Linen\n\n1“Moreover, you shall make the tabernacle (sacred tent of worship) with ten [interior] curtains of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet fabric; you shall make them with [embroidered] cherubim, the handwork of a skillful craftsman. 2The length of each curtain shall be twenty-eight cubits, and the width of each curtain four cubits; all of the curtains shall measure the same. 3The five curtains shall be joined to one another, and the other five curtains shall be joined to one another. 4You shall make loops of blue on the outer edge of the last curtain in the first set, and likewise in the second set. 5You shall make fifty loops on the one curtain, and fifty loops on the edge of the last curtain that is in the second set. The loops on one curtain correspond to the loops on the other. 6You shall make fifty gold hooks, and fasten the curtains together with the hooks; and the tabernacle shall be one unit.\n\nCurtains of Goats’ Hair 7“Then you shall make [exterior] curtains of goats’ hair as a tent over the tabernacle. You shall make eleven curtains in all. 8Each curtain shall be thirty cubits long and four cubits wide. The eleven curtains shall all measure the same. 9You shall join five curtains by themselves and the other six curtains by themselves, and you shall double over the sixth curtain at the front of the tent [to make a closed door]. 10Make fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set, and fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the second set.\n\n11“You shall make fifty bronze hooks and put the hooks into the loops and join the tent together so that it may be one unit. 12The overlapping part that is left over from the tent curtains, the half curtain that is left over, shall lap over the back of the tabernacle. 13The cubit on one side and the cubit on the other, of what is left over in the length of the curtains of the tent shall lap over the sides of the tabernacle on one side and the other side, to cover it. 14You shall make a third covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and a fourth covering above that of porpoise skins.\n\nBoards and Sockets 15“Then you shall make the boards for the tabernacle of acacia wood, standing upright [as a trellis-like frame]. 16The length of each board shall be ten cubits and the width of each board shall be one and a half cubits. 17Make two dovetails in each board for fitting [them] together; you shall do the same for all the tabernacle boards. 18You shall make the boards for the tabernacle [in the following quantities]: twenty boards for the south side. 19You shall make forty silver sockets under the twenty boards, two sockets under each board for its two dovetails, and two sockets under another board for its two dovetails; 20for the north side of the tabernacle there shall be twenty boards, 21and their forty silver sockets, two sockets under each board. 22For the back or west side of the tabernacle you shall make six boards. 23Make two boards for the corners of the tabernacle at the rear [on both sides]. 24They shall be joined together underneath, and joined together on top with one ring. So shall it be for both of them; they shall form the two [rear] corners. 25There shall be eight boards and sixteen silver sockets; two sockets under each board.\n\n26“Then you shall make [fifteen] bars of acacia wood: five for the boards of one side of the tabernacle, 27and five bars for the boards of the other side of the tabernacle, and five bars for the boards of the rear end of the tabernacle, for the back wall toward the west. 28And the middle bar in the center of the boards shall pass through [horizontally] from end to end. 29You shall overlay the boards with gold and make their rings of gold to hold the bars. You shall overlay the bars with gold. 30You shall erect the tabernacle according to its plan [the direction corresponding to its meaning and purpose] which has been shown to you on the mountain.\n\nThe Veil and Screen 31“You shall make a veil [to divide the two rooms] of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric and fine twisted linen, skillfully worked with cherubim on it. 32You shall hang it on four pillars (support poles) of acacia wood overlaid with gold, with gold hooks, on four silver sockets. 33You shall hang the veil from the hooks [that connect the curtains together], and you shall bring the ark of the Testimony there within the veil. The veil shall separate for you the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. 34You shall put the mercy seat on the ark of the Testimony in the Holy of Holies. 35You shall set the table [for the bread] outside the veil [in the Holy Place] on the north side, and the lampstand opposite the table on the south side of the tabernacle.\n\n36“You shall make a screen [to provide a covering] for the doorway of the tent of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric and finely woven [embroidered] linen, the work of an embroiderer. 37You shall make five pillars (support poles) of acacia wood to support the hanging curtain and overlay them with gold. Their hooks shall be of gold, and you shall cast five [base] sockets of bronze for them.\n\nExodus 27\nThe Bronze Altar\n\n1“And you shall make the altar [for burnt offerings] of acacia wood, five cubits long and five cubits wide; the altar shall be square, and its height shall be three cubits. 2Make horns (horn-shaped projections) for it on its four corners; the horns shall be of one piece with it, and you shall overlay it with bronze. 3You shall make pots to remove its ashes, and shovels, basins [to catch the blood of the sacrificed animal], meat-forks, and firepans [to store live coals]. You shall make all its utensils of bronze. 4Also make a grate for it, a network of bronze; and on the grid you are to make four bronze rings at its four corners. 5And you shall put it under the ledge of the altar, so that the grid will extend halfway up the altar. 6You shall make [carrying] poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood, overlaid with bronze. 7The poles shall be inserted through the rings on the two sides of the altar so that it may be carried. 8You are to make the altar hollow with planks; as you were shown on the mountain [of Sinai], so shall it be made.\n\nCourt of the Tabernacle 9“You shall make the court of the tabernacle. The south side of the court is to have curtains of fine twisted linen, a hundred cubits long for one side; 10it shall have twenty pillars and twenty bronze sockets; but the hooks of the pillars and their fasteners shall be silver; 11likewise for the north side there shall be curtains, a hundred cubits long, and its twenty pillars and twenty bronze sockets; but the hooks of the pillars and their fasteners shall be silver. 12For the width of the court on the west side there shall be curtains of fifty cubits, with ten pillars (support poles) and ten sockets. 13The width of the court [to the front], on the east side shall be fifty cubits. 14The curtains for one side [of the gate] shall be fifteen cubits with three pillars and three sockets. 15On the other side [of the gate] the curtains shall be fifteen cubits with three pillars and three sockets. 16For the gate of the court there shall be a screen [to provide a covering] of twenty cubits, of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric and finely woven [embroidered] linen, the work of an embroiderer, with four pillars and four [base] sockets. 17All the pillars (support poles) around the court shall be joined together with silver rods; their hooks shall be of silver and their sockets of bronze. 18The length of the court shall be a hundred cubits, and the width fifty [cubits] throughout, and the height five cubits of fine twisted linen, and their sockets of bronze. 19All the tabernacle’s utensils and instruments used in all its service, and all its stakes, and all the stakes for the court, shall be of bronze.\n\n20“You shall command the Israelites to provide you with clear oil of beaten olives for the light, to make a lamp burn continually [every night]. 21In the Tent of Meeting [of God with His people], outside the veil which is in front of the [ark of the] Testimony [and sets it apart], Aaron [the high priest] and his sons shall keep the lamp burning from evening to morning before the LORD. It shall be a perpetual statute [to be observed] throughout their generations on behalf of the Israelites.\n\nExodus 28\nGarments Of The Priests\n\n1“Now bring your brother Aaron near, and his sons with him from among the sons of Israel, so that he may serve as priest to Me—Aaron, Nadab and Abihu, Eleazar and Ithamar, Aaron’s sons. 2You are to make sacred garments [official clothing reserved for holy services] for Aaron your brother, for honor and for beauty (ornamentation). 3Tell all the skilled and talented people whom I have endowed with a spirit of wisdom, that they are to make Aaron’s garments to sanctify him and set him apart to serve as a priest for Me. 4These are the garments which they shall make: a breastpiece and an ephod [for the breastpiece] and a robe and a tunic of checkered work, a turban, and a sash. They shall make sacred garments for Aaron your brother and his sons, so that he may serve as a priest to Me. 5They are to use the gold and the blue and the purple and the scarlet fabric and fine twisted linen [from the people],\n\n6and they shall make the ephod of gold and blue, purple, and scarlet fabric and fine twisted linen, skillfully woven and [beautifully] worked. 7It is to have two shoulder pieces joined to its two [back and front] ends, so that it may be joined together. 8And the skillfully woven sash, which is on the ephod shall be made of the same material: of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric and fine twisted linen. 9You shall take two onyx stones and engrave on them the names of the [twelve] sons of Israel, 10six of their names on one stone and the remaining six names on the other stone, arranged in the order of their births. 11With the work of a jeweler, like the engravings of a signet, you shall engrave the two stones according to the names of the sons of Israel. You shall have them set in filigree [settings] of gold. 12You shall put the two stones on the [two] shoulder pieces of the ephod [of the high priest], as memorial stones for Israel; and Aaron shall bear their names on his two shoulders as a memorial before the LORD. 13You shall make filigree [settings] of gold, 14and you are to make two chains of pure gold like twisted cords, and fasten the corded chains to the settings.\n\n15“You are to make a breastpiece of judgment, the work of a skilled and talented craftsman; like the work of the ephod you shall make it: of gold, of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric and of fine twisted linen. 16The breastpiece shall be square and folded double; a span [about nine inches] in length and a span in width. 17You shall mount on it four rows of stones: the first row shall be a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald; 18the second row a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 19the third row a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 20and the fourth row a beryl and an onyx and a jasper; they shall be set in gold filigree. 21The [engraved] stones shall be twelve, according to the names of [the twelve tribes of] the sons of Israel; they shall be like the engravings of a signet, each with its name for the twelve tribes. 22You shall make for the breastpiece chains of pure gold twisted like cords. 23You shall make on the breastpiece two rings of gold, and shall put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece. 24You shall put the two twisted cords of gold in the two rings which are on the ends of the breastpiece. 25The other two ends of the two cords you shall fasten in the two filigree settings in front, putting them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod. 26You shall make two gold rings and put them at the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inside edge next to the ephod. 27You are to make two gold rings and attach them to the lower part of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod in front, close to the place where it is joined, above the skillfully woven sash of the ephod. 28They shall bind the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it will be above the skillfully woven sash of the ephod, so that the breastpiece will not come loose from the ephod. 29So Aaron shall carry the names of the sons of Israel (Jacob) in the breastpiece of judgment over his heart when he enters the Holy Place, to bring them in continual remembrance before the LORD. 30In the breastpiece of judgment you shall put the Urim (Lights) and the Thummim (Perfections) [to be used for determining God’s will in a matter]. They shall be over Aaron’s heart whenever he goes before the LORD, and Aaron shall always carry the judgment (verdict, judicial decisions) of the sons of Israel over his heart before the LORD.\n\n31“And you shall make the robe of the ephod all of blue. 32There shall be an opening at its top in the center [for the head], with a binding of woven work around the opening, like the opening in a coat of armor, so that it will not tear or fray. 33You shall make pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric all around its hem, with gold bells between them; 34a golden bell and a pomegranate, a golden bell and a pomegranate, all around the [bottom] hem of the robe. 35Aaron shall wear the robe when he ministers, and its sound shall be heard when he goes [alone] into the Holy Place before the LORD, and when he comes out, so that he will not die there.\n\n36“You shall also make a plate of pure gold and engrave on it, like the engravings of a signet, ‘Holy to the LORD.’ 37You shall fasten it on the front of the turban with a blue cord. 38It shall be on Aaron’s forehead, and Aaron shall take away the guilt from the holy things which the sons of Israel dedicate, with regard to all their holy gifts. It shall always be on his forehead, so that they may be accepted before the LORD.\n\n39“You shall weave the tunic of checkered work of fine linen, and make a turban of fine linen. You shall make a sash, the work of an embroiderer.\n\n40“For Aaron’s sons you shall make tunics and sashes and [ornamental] caps, for glory and honor and beauty. 41You shall put the various articles of clothing on Aaron your brother and on his sons with him, and shall anoint them and ordain and sanctify them, so that they may serve Me as priests. 42You shall make for them [white] linen undergarments to cover their bare flesh, reaching from the waist to the thighs. 43The various articles of clothing shall be on Aaron and on his sons when they enter the Tent of Meeting, or when they approach the altar [of incense] to minister in the Holy Place, so that they do not incur guilt and die. It shall be a statute forever to Aaron and to his descendants after him.\n\nExodus 29\nConsecration Of The Priests\n\n1“This is what you shall do to consecrate Aaron and his sons so that they may serve Me as priests: take one young bull and two rams, without blemish, 2and unleavened bread and unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil; you shall make them of fine wheat flour. 3You shall put them in one basket, and present them in the basket along with the bull and the two rams. 4Then bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting [out where the basin is] and wash them with water. 5Then you shall take the garments, and put on Aaron the tunic and the robe of the ephod and the ephod and the breastpiece, and wrap him with the skillfully woven sash of the ephod; 6and you shall put the turban on his head and put the holy crown on the turban. 7Then you shall take the anointing oil and pour it on his head and anoint him. 8You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them. 9And you shall wrap them with sashes, Aaron and his sons, and put the [ornamental] caps on them; and the priest’s office shall be theirs by a perpetual statute. So you shall ordain Aaron and his sons.\n\nThe Sacrifices 10“Then you shall bring the bull before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the bull’s head. 11Then you shall kill the bull before the LORD by the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 12And you shall take some of the blood of the bull and with your finger put it on the horns of the altar [of burnt offering], and you shall pour out the remainder of the blood at the base of the altar. 13You shall take all the fat that covers the intestines and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and the fat that is on them, and offer them up in smoke on the altar. 14But the meat of the bull, its hide, and the contents of its intestines you shall burn in the fire outside the camp; it is a sin offering.\n\n15“And you shall take one of the rams, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram; 16then you shall kill the ram and you shall take its blood and sprinkle it around the altar [of burnt offering]. 17Then you shall cut the ram into pieces, and wash its intestines and legs, and place them with its pieces and its head, 18and you shall burn the whole ram on the altar. It is a burnt offering to the LORD: it is a sweet and soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.\n\n19“Then you shall take the other ram, and Aaron and his sons shall lay their hands on the head of the ram. 20Then you shall kill the ram, and take some of its blood and put it on the tip of the right ears of Aaron and his sons and on the thumbs of their right hands and on the big toes of their right feet, and sprinkle the [rest of the] blood around on the altar [of burnt offering]. 21Then you shall take some of the blood that is on the altar and some of the anointing oil, and sprinkle it on Aaron and his garments and on his sons and their garments. Now Aaron and his garments and his sons and their garments shall be consecrated (dedicated, made holy, declared sacred for God’s purpose).\n\n22“You shall also take the fat of the ram, the fat tail, the fat that covers the intestines, the lobe of the liver, the two kidneys with the fat that is on them, and the right thigh; (for it is a ram of ordination), 23and one loaf of bread and one cake of oiled bread and one wafer out of the basket of the unleavened bread that is before the LORD; 24and you shall put all these in the hands of Aaron and his sons, and wave them as a wave offering before the LORD. 25Then you shall take them from their hands, add them to the burnt offering, and burn them on the altar for a sweet and soothing aroma before the LORD; it is an offering by fire to the LORD.\n\n26“Then you shall take the breast of the ram of Aaron’s ordination, and wave it as a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be your (Moses) portion. 27You shall consecrate the waved breast offering [of the ram] used in the ordination and the waved thigh offering of the priests’ portion, since it is [a contribution] for Aaron and for his sons. 28It shall be for Aaron and his sons as their due portion from the Israelites forever, for it is a heave offering. It shall be a heave offering to the LORD from the Israelites from the sacrifices of their peace offerings.\n\n29“The holy garments of Aaron shall be for his sons after him, to be anointed and ordained in them. 30That son who is [high] priest in his place shall put them on [each day for] seven days when he comes into the Tent of Meeting to minister in the Holy Place.\n\nFood of the Priests 31“You shall take the ram of the ordination and boil its meat in a holy place. 32Aaron and his sons shall eat the meat of the ram and the bread in the basket, at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 33They shall eat those things by which atonement was made at their ordination and consecration; but a layman shall not eat them, because they are holy [that is, set apart to the worship of God]. 34And if any of the meat of ordination or the bread remains until morning, you shall burn it in the fire; it shall not be eaten, because it is holy.\n\n35“So you shall do to Aaron and to his sons in accordance with all I have commanded you; during seven days you are to ordain them. 36You shall offer a bull every day as a sin offering for atonement. You shall cleanse the altar from sin when you make atonement for it, and you shall anoint it to consecrate it [for God’s sacred purpose]. 37For seven days you shall make atonement for the altar [of burnt offering] and consecrate it; then the altar shall be most holy. Whatever touches the altar must be holy (set apart for God’s service).\n\n38“Now this is what you shall offer on the altar: two one year old lambs shall be offered each day, continuously. 39One lamb you shall offer in the morning and the other lamb at twilight; 40and with the one lamb there shall be one-tenth of a measure of fine flour mixed with one-fourth of a hin of beaten [olive] oil, and one-fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering [to be poured out]. 41And the other lamb you shall offer at twilight, and do with it as with the grain offering of the morning and with the drink offering, for a sweet and soothing aroma [to appease God], an offering by fire to the LORD. 42This will be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, where I will meet with you, to speak to you there. 43There I will meet with the Israelites, and the Tent of Meeting shall be sanctified by My glory [the Shekinah, God’s dwelling presence]. 44I will sanctify the Tent of Meeting and the altar [of burnt offering]; also I will sanctify Aaron and his sons to serve as priests to Me. 45I will dwell among the sons of Israel and be their God. 46They shall know [from personal experience] and acknowledge that I am the LORD their God who brought them out of the land of Egypt so that I might dwell among them; I am the LORD their God.\n\nExodus 30\nThe Altar Of Incense\n\n1“You shall make an altar upon which to burn incense; you shall make it of acacia wood. 2It shall be a cubit long and a cubit wide. It shall be square and it shall be two cubits high. Its horns of one piece with it. 3You shall overlay it with pure gold, its top and its sides all around, and its horns; and you shall make a gold molding all around it. 4You shall make two gold rings under its molding, make them on the two side walls—on opposite sides—they shall be holders for the poles with which to carry it. 5You shall make the poles of acacia wood overlaid with gold. 6You shall put the altar of incense [in the Holy Place] in front and outside of the veil that screens the ark of the Testimony, before the mercy seat that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you. 7Aaron shall burn sweet and fragrant incense on it; he shall burn it every morning when he trims and tends the lamps. 8When Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn incense, a perpetual incense before the LORD throughout your generations. 9You shall not offer any strange incense on this altar, or burnt offering or meal offering; you shall not pour out a drink offering on it. 10“Once a year Aaron shall make atonement [for sin] on its horns. He shall make atonement on it with the blood of the sin offering of atonement once a year throughout your generations. It is most holy to the LORD.”\n\nThe Ransom Money 11Then the LORD said to Moses, 12“When you take the census of the Israelites, each one shall give a ransom for himself to the LORD when you count them, so that no plague will come on them when you number them. 13This is what everyone who is counted shall give [as he joins those already counted]: a half shekel, according to the sanctuary shekel (the shekel is twenty gerahs); a half shekel as a contribution to the LORD. 14Everyone who is counted, from twenty years old and over, [as he joins those already counted], shall give this contribution to the LORD. 15The rich shall not give more and the poor shall not give less than half a shekel, when you give this contribution to the LORD to make atonement for yourselves. 16“You shall take the atonement money from the Israelites and use it [exclusively] for the service of the Tent of Meeting, so that it may be a memorial for the Israelites before the LORD, to make atonement for yourselves.”\n\nThe Bronze Basin 17Then the LORD said to Moses, 18“You shall also make a basin of bronze, with a base of bronze, for washing. You shall put it [outside in the court] between the Tent of Meeting and the altar [of burnt offering], and you shall put water in it. 19Aaron and his sons shall wash their hands and their feet. 20When they enter the Tent of Meeting, they shall wash with water, so that they will not die. Also, when they approach the altar to minister, to burn an offering in the fire to the LORD [they shall do the same]. 21“They shall wash their hands and their feet, so that they will not die; it shall be a perpetual statute for them, for Aaron and his descendants throughout their generations.”\n\nThe Anointing Oil 22Moreover, the LORD said to Moses, 23“Take for yourself the best spices: five hundred shekels of liquid myrrh, half as much—two hundred and fifty—of sweet-scented cinnamon, and two hundred and fifty of fragrant cane, 24and five hundred shekels of cinnamon blossom according to the sanctuary shekel, and a hin of olive oil. 25You shall make of these a holy anointing oil, a perfume mixture, the work of a perfumer; it shall be a sacred anointing oil. 26You shall anoint the Tent of Meeting with it, and the ark of the Testimony, 27and the table [for the bread] and all its utensils, and the lampstand and its utensils, and the altar of incense, 28and the altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, and the basin [for cleansing] and its base. 29You shall consecrate them, that they may be most holy; whatever touches them must be holy (set apart for God). 30You shall anoint Aaron and his sons, and consecrate them, that they may serve as priests to Me. 31You shall say to the Israelites, ‘This shall be a holy and sacred anointing oil, to Me [alone] throughout your generations. 32‘It shall not be poured on anyone’s body, nor shall you make any like it in the same composition. It is holy, and it shall be sacred to you. 33‘Whoever prepares any like it or puts any of it on a layman shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them].’”\n\nThe Incense 34Then the LORD said to Moses, “Take sweet and fragrant spices—stacte, onycha, and galbanum, sweet and fragrant spices with pure frankincense; there shall be an equal amount of each— 35and make incense with it, a perfume, the work of a perfumer, salted, pure and sacred. 36You shall crush some of it [into a] very fine [powder], and put some of it before the Testimony in the Tent of Meeting, where I will meet with you; it shall be most holy to you. 37The incense which you shall make, you shall not make in the same proportions for yourselves; it shall be holy to you for the LORD. 38“Whoever makes any like it, to use as perfume shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them].”\n\nExodus 31\nThe Skilled Craftsmen\n\n1Now the LORD said to Moses, 2“See, I have called by name Bezalel, son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah. 3I have filled him with the Spirit of God in wisdom and skill, in understanding and intelligence, in knowledge, and in all kinds of craftsmanship, 4to make artistic designs for work in gold, in silver, and in bronze, 5and in the cutting of stones for settings, and in the carving of wood, to work in all kinds of craftsmanship. 6And behold, I Myself have appointed with him Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan; to all who are wise-hearted I have given the skill and ability to make everything that I have commanded you: 7the Tent of Meeting, the ark of the Testimony, the mercy seat that is upon it, all the furnishings of the tent— 8the table [for the bread] and its utensils, the pure gold lampstand with all its utensils, the [golden] altar of incense, 9the [bronze] altar of burnt offering with all its utensils, the basin and its base— 10the finely worked garments, the holy garments for Aaron the [high] priest and the garments for his sons to minister as priests, 11and the anointing oil and the sweet and fragrant incense for the Holy Place. They are to make them according to all that I have commanded you.”\n\nThe Sign of the Sabbath 12And the LORD said to Moses, 13“But as for you, say to the Israelites, ‘You shall most certainly observe My Sabbaths, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, so that you may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that I am the LORD who sanctifies you and sets you apart [for Myself]. 14‘Therefore, you shall keep the Sabbath, for it is holy to you. Everyone who profanes it must be put to death; for whoever does work on the Sabbath, that person (soul) shall be cut off from among his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 15‘For six days work may be done, but the seventh is the Sabbath of complete rest, sacred to the LORD; whoever does work on the Sabbath day must be put to death. 16‘So the Israelites shall observe the Sabbath, to celebrate the Sabbath throughout their generations as a perpetual covenant.’ 17“It is a sign between Me and the Israelites forever; for in six days the LORD made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He ceased and was refreshed.”\n\n18When He had finished speaking with him on Mount Sinai, He gave Moses the two tablets of the Testimony, tablets of stone, written with the finger of God.\n\nExodus 32\nThe Golden Calf\n\n1Now when the people saw that Moses delayed coming down from the mountain, they gathered together before Aaron and said to him, “Come, make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us up from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.” 2So Aaron replied to them, “Take off the gold rings that are in the ears of your wives, your sons and daughters, and bring them to me.” 3So all the people took off the gold rings that were in their ears and brought them to Aaron. 4And he took the gold from their hands, and fashioned it with an engraving tool and made it into a molten calf; and they said, “This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt.” 5Now when Aaron saw the molten calf, he built an altar before it; and Aaron made a proclamation, and said, “Tomorrow shall be a feast to the LORD!” 6So they got up early the next day and offered burnt offerings, and brought peace offerings; then the people sat down to eat and drink, and got up to play [shamefully—without moral restraint].\n\n7Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go down at once, for your people, whom you brought up from the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves. 8“They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them. They have made themselves a molten calf, and have worshiped it and sacrificed to it, and said, ‘This is your god, O Israel, who brought you up from the land of Egypt!’” 9The LORD said to Moses, “I have seen this people, and behold, they are a stiff-necked (stubborn, rebellious) people. 10“Now therefore, let Me alone and do not interfere, so that My anger may burn against them and that I may destroy them; and I will make of you (your descendants) a great nation.”\n\nMoses’ Entreaty 11But Moses appeased and entreated the LORD his God, and said, “LORD, why does Your anger burn against Your people whom You have brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and a mighty hand? 12Why should the Egyptians say, ‘With evil [intent] their God brought them out to kill them in the mountains and destroy them from the face of the earth’? Turn away from Your burning anger and change Your mind about harming Your people. 13“Remember Abraham, Isaac, and Israel (Jacob), Your servants to whom You swore [an oath] by Yourself, and said to them, ‘I will multiply your descendants as the stars of the heavens, and all this land of which I have spoken I will give to your descendants, and they shall inherit it forever.’” 14So the LORD changed His mind about the harm which He had said He would do to His people.\n\n15Then Moses turned and went down from the mountain with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand; tablets that were written on both sides—they were written on one side and on the other. 16The tablets were the work of God; the writing was the writing of God engraved on the tablets. 17Now when Joshua heard the noise of the people as they shouted, he said to Moses, “There is a sound of battle in the camp.” 18But Moses said,\n“It is not the sound of the cry of victory,\nNor is it the sound of the cry of defeat;\nBut I hear the sound of singing.”\nMoses’ Anger 19And as soon as he approached the camp and he saw the calf and the dancing, Moses’ anger burned; and he threw the tablets from his hands and smashed them at the foot of the mountain. 20Then Moses took the calf they had made and burned it in the fire, and ground it to powder, and scattered it on the surface of the water and made the Israelites drink it.\n\n21Then Moses said to Aaron, “What did this people do to you, that you have brought so great a sin on them?” 22Aaron said, “Do not let the anger of my lord burn; you know the people yourself, that they are prone to evil. 23For they said to me, ‘Make us a god who will go before us; as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him.’ 24“I said to them, ‘Let whoever has gold [jewelry], take it off.’ So they gave it to me; then I threw it into the fire, and out came this calf.”\n\n25Now when Moses saw that the people were out of control—for Aaron had let them get out of control to the point of being an object of mockery among their enemies— 26then Moses stood in the gate of the camp, and said, “Whoever is on the LORD’S side, come to me!” And all the sons of Levi [the priestly tribe] gathered together to him. 27He said to them, “Thus says the LORD God of Israel, ‘Every man strap his sword on his thigh and go back and forth from gate to gate throughout the camp, and every man kill his brother, and every man his friend, and every man his neighbor [all who continue pagan worship].’” 28So the sons of Levi did as Moses instructed, and about three thousand men of the people [of Israel] were killed that day. 29Then Moses said [to the Levites], “Dedicate yourselves today to the LORD—for each man has been against his own son and his own brother [in his attempt to escape execution]—so that He may restore and bestow His blessing on you this day.”\n\n30Then the next day Moses said to the people, “You have committed a great sin. Now I will go up to the LORD; perhaps I can make atonement for your sin.” 31So Moses returned to the LORD, and said, “Oh, these people have committed a great sin [against You], and have made themselves a god of gold. 32“Yet now, if You will, forgive their sin—and if not, please blot me out of Your book which You have written (kill me)!” 33But the LORD said to Moses, “Whoever has sinned against Me, I will blot him out of My book [not you]. 34“But now go, lead the people [to the place] where I have told you. Behold, My Angel shall go before you; nevertheless, in the day when I punish, I will punish them for their sin!” 35So the LORD struck the people with a plague, because of what they had done with the calf which Aaron had made [for them].\n\nExodus 33\nThe Journey Resumed\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, “Depart, go up from here, you and the people whom you have brought from the land of Egypt, to the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob (Israel), saying, ‘To your descendants I will give it.’ 2I will send an Angel before you and I will drive out the Canaanite, the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 3“Go up to a land [of abundance] flowing with milk and honey; for I will not go up in your midst, because you are a stiff-necked (stubborn, rebellious) people, and I might destroy you on the way.”\n\n4When the people heard this sad word, they mourned, and none of them put on his ornaments. 5For the LORD had said to Moses, “Say to the sons of Israel, ‘You are a stiff-necked (stubborn, rebellious) people! If I should come among you for one moment, I would destroy you. Now therefore, [penitently] take off your ornaments, so that I may know what to do with you.’” 6So the Israelites left off all their ornaments [in repentance], from Mount Horeb (Sinai) onward.\n\n7Now Moses used to take his own tent and pitch it outside the camp, far away from the camp, and he called it the tent of meeting [of God with His own people]. And everyone who sought the LORD would go out to the [temporary] tent of meeting which was outside the camp. 8Whenever Moses went out to the tent, all the people would rise and stand, each at his tent door, and look at Moses until he entered the tent. 9Whenever Moses entered the tent, the pillar of cloud would descend and stand at the doorway of the tent; and the LORD would speak with Moses. 10When all the people saw the pillar of cloud standing at the tent door, all the people would rise and worship, each at his tent door. 11And so the LORD used to speak to Moses face to face, just as a man speaks to his friend. When Moses returned to the camp, his attendant Joshua, the son of Nun, a young man, would not depart from the tent.\n\nMoses Intercedes 12Moses said to the LORD, “See, You say to me, ‘Bring up this people,’ but You have not let me know whom You will send with me. Yet You have said, ‘I know you by name, and you have also found favor in My sight.’ 13“Now therefore, I pray you, if I have found favor in Your sight, let me know Your ways so that I may know You [becoming more deeply and intimately acquainted with You, recognizing and understanding Your ways more clearly] and that I may find grace and favor in Your sight. And consider also, that this nation is Your people.” 14And the LORD said, “My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest [by bringing you and the people into the promised land].” 15And Moses said to Him, “If Your presence does not go [with me], do not lead us up from here. 16“For how then can it be known that Your people and I have found favor in Your sight? Is it not by Your going with us, so that we are distinguished, Your people and I, from all the [other] people on the face of the earth?”\n\n17The LORD said to Moses, “I will also do this thing that you have asked; for you have found favor (lovingkindness, mercy) in My sight and I have known you [personally] by name.” 18Then Moses said, “Please, show me Your glory!” 19And God said, “I will make all My goodness pass before you, and I will proclaim the Name of the LORD before you; for I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show compassion (lovingkindness) on whom I will show compassion.” 20But He said, “You cannot see My face, for no man shall see Me and live!” 21Then the LORD said, “Behold, there is a place beside Me, and you shall stand there on the rock; 22and while My glory is passing by, I will put you in a cleft of the rock and protectively cover you with My hand until I have passed by. 23“Then I will take away My hand and you shall see My back; but My face shall not be seen.”\n\nExodus 34\nThe Two Tablets Replaced\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Cut two tablets of stone like the first, and I will write on these tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you smashed [when you learned of Israel’s idolatry]. 2So be ready by morning, and come up in the morning to Mount Sinai, and present yourself there to Me on the top of the mountain. 3“No man is to come up with you, nor let any man be seen anywhere on the mountain; nor let flocks or herds feed in front of that mountain.” 4So Moses cut two tablets of stone like the first ones, and he got up early in the morning and went up on Mount Sinai, as the LORD had commanded him, and took the two tablets of stone in his hand. 5Then the LORD descended in the cloud and stood there with Moses as he proclaimed the Name of the LORD. 6Then the LORD passed by in front of him, and proclaimed, “The LORD, the LORD God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness and truth (faithfulness); 7keeping mercy and lovingkindness for thousands, forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin; but He will by no means leave the guilty unpunished, visiting (avenging) the iniquity (sin, guilt) of the fathers upon the children and the grandchildren to the third and fourth generations [that is, calling the children to account for the sins of their fathers].” 8Moses bowed to the earth immediately and worshiped [the Lord]. 9And he said, “If now I have found favor and lovingkindness in Your sight, O Lord, let the Lord, please, go in our midst, though it is a stiff-necked (stubborn, rebellious) people, and pardon our iniquity and our sin, and take us as Your possession.”\n\nThe Covenant Renewed 10Then God said, “Behold, I am going to make a covenant. Before all your people I will do wondrous works (miracles) such as have not been created or produced in all the earth nor among any of the nations; and all the people among whom you live shall see the working of the LORD, for it is a fearful and awesome thing that I am going to do with you.\n\n11“Be sure to observe what I am commanding you this day: behold, I am going to drive out the Amorite before you, and the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, the Hivite, and the Jebusite. 12Watch yourself so that you do not make a covenant (solemn agreement, treaty) with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a [dangerous] trap among you. 13But you shall tear down and destroy their [pagan] altars, smash in pieces their [sacred] pillars (obelisks, images) and cut down their Asherim 14—for you shall not worship any other god; for the LORD, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous (impassioned) God [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely His]— 15otherwise you might make a covenant with the inhabitants of the land and they would play the prostitute with their gods and sacrifice to their gods, and someone might invite you to eat his sacrifice (meal), 16and you might take some of his daughters for your sons, and his daughters would play the prostitute with their gods and cause your sons also to play the prostitute (commit apostasy) with their gods [that is, abandon the true God for man-made idols]. 17You shall make for yourselves no molten gods.\n\n18“You shall observe the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Passover). For seven days you shall eat unleavened bread, as I have commanded you, at the appointed time in the month of Abib; for in the month of Abib you came out of Egypt.\n\n19“All the firstborn males among your livestock belong to Me, whether cattle or sheep. 20You shall redeem the firstborn of a donkey with a lamb; but if you do not redeem it, then you shall break its neck. You shall redeem all the firstborn of your sons. None of you are to appear before Me empty-handed.\n\n21“You shall work for six days, but on the seventh day you shall rest; [even] in plowing time and in harvest you shall rest [on the Sabbath]. 22You shall observe and celebrate the Feast of Weeks (Harvest, First Fruits, or Pentecost), the first fruits of the wheat harvest, and the Feast of Ingathering (Booths or Tabernacles) at the year’s end. 23Three times a year all your males shall appear before the Lord GOD, the God of Israel. 24For I will drive out and dispossess nations before you and enlarge your borders; nor shall any man covet (actively seek for himself) your land when you go up to appear before the LORD your God three times a year.\n\n25“You shall not offer the blood of My sacrifice with leavened bread, nor shall the sacrifice of the Feast of the Passover (Unleavened Bread) be left over until morning.\n\n26“You shall bring the very first of the first fruits of your ground to the house of the LORD your God.\n\n“You shall not boil a young goat in his mother’s milk [as some pagans do].”\n\n27Then the LORD said to Moses, “Write these words, for in accordance with these words I have made a covenant with you and with Israel.” 28Moses was there with the LORD forty days and forty nights; he ate no bread and drank no water. And he wrote on the tablets the words of the covenant, the Ten Commandments.\n\nMoses’ Face Shines 29When Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the two tablets of the Testimony in his hand, he did not know that the skin of his face was shining [with a unique radiance] because he had been speaking with God. 30When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, behold, the skin of his face shone, and they were afraid to approach him. 31But Moses called to them, and Aaron and all the leaders of the congregation returned to him; and he spoke to them. 32Afterward all the Israelites approached him, and he commanded them to do everything that the LORD had said to him on Mount Sinai. 33When Moses had finished speaking with them, he put a veil over his face. 34But whenever Moses went in before the LORD to speak with Him, he would take off the veil until he came out. When he came out and he told the Israelites what he had been commanded [by God], 35the Israelites would see the face of Moses, how his skin shone [with a unique radiance]. So Moses put the veil on his face again until he went in to speak with God.\n\nExodus 35\nThe Sabbath Emphasized\n\n1Moses gathered all the congregation of the sons of Israel together, and said to them, “These are the things which the LORD has commanded you to do:\n\n2“For six days work may be done, but the seventh day shall be a holy day for you, a Sabbath of complete rest to the LORD; whoever does any kind of work on that day shall be put to death. 3“You shall not kindle a fire in any of your dwellings on the Sabbath day.”\n\n4And Moses said to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: 5‘Take from among you an offering to the LORD. Whoever has a willing heart, let him bring it as the LORD’S offering: gold, silver, and bronze, 6blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, fine linen, goats’ hair, 7and rams’ skins dyed red, and skins of porpoises, and acacia wood, 8and [olive] oil for the lighting, and balsam for the anointing oil, and for the fragrant incense, 9and onyx stones and other stones to be set for the ephod and the breastpiece.\n\nTabernacle Workmen 10‘Let every skilled and talented man among you come, and make everything that the LORD has commanded: 11the tabernacle (sacred dwelling of God), its tent and its covering, its hooks, its boards, its bars, its pillars, and its sockets; 12the ark [of the covenant] and its carrying poles, with the mercy seat and the veil (partition curtain) of the screen [to hang between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies]; 13the table and its carrying poles, and all its utensils, and the bread of the [divine] Presence (showbread); 14the lampstand also for the light and its utensils and its lamps, and the oil for the light; 15and the altar of incense and its carrying poles, the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, the screen (curtain) for the doorway at the entrance of the tabernacle; 16the altar of burnt offering with its bronze grating, its carrying poles, and all its utensils, the wash basin and its base (stand); 17the court’s curtains, its support poles and their sockets, and the curtain for the gate of the courtyard; 18the pegs of the tabernacle and the pegs of the court and their cords; 19the finely-woven garments for ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest and the garments for his sons, to minister as priests.’”\n\nGifts Received 20Then all the congregation of the Israelites left Moses’ presence. 21Everyone whose heart stirred him and everyone whose spirit moved him came and brought the LORD’S offering to be used for the Tent of Meeting, for all its service, and for the holy garments. 22Then all whose hearts moved them, both men and women, came and brought brooches, earrings or nose rings, signet rings, and necklaces, all jewels of gold; everyone bringing an offering of gold to the LORD. 23Every man who had in his possession blue or purple or scarlet fabric, and fine linen, and goats’ hair, and rams’ skins dyed red and porpoise skins, brought them. 24Everyone who could make an offering of silver or bronze brought it as the LORD’S offering; every man who had in his possession acacia wood for any work of the service brought it. 25All the skilled and talented women spun thread with their hands, and brought what they had spun, blue and purple and scarlet fabric and fine linen. 26All the women whose heart stirred with a skill spun the goats’ hair. 27The leaders brought onyx stones and other stones to be put in settings for the ephod and for the breastpiece, 28and spice and [olive] oil for the light and for the anointing oil and for the fragrant incense. 29The Israelites, all the men and women whose heart moved them to bring material for all the work which the LORD had commanded through Moses to be done, brought a freewill (voluntary) offering to the LORD.\n\n30Then Moses said to the Israelites, “See, the LORD called by name Bezalel son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah; 31and He has filled him with the Spirit of God, with wisdom and skill, with intelligence and understanding, and with knowledge in all [areas of] craftsmanship, 32to devise artistic designs to work in gold, silver, and bronze, 33and in the cutting of stones for setting and in the carving of wood, for work in every skilled craft. 34He has also put in Bezalel’s heart [the willingness] to teach [others the same skills], both he and Oholiab, son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan. 35He has filled them with skill to do the work of an engraver, of a designer, and of an embroiderer, in blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and in fine linen, and of a weaver; makers of every work and embroiderers of [excellent] designs.\n\nExodus 36\nThe Tabernacle Underwritten\n\n1“Bezalel and Oholiab, and every skilled person in whom the LORD has put ability and understanding to know how to do all the work in the construction of the sanctuary, shall work according to all that the LORD has commanded.”\n\n2So Moses called Bezalel and Oholiab and every skilled person in whom the LORD had put ability, everyone whose heart stirred him, to come to do the work. 3They received from Moses all the offerings which the Israelites had brought for the construction of the sanctuary, to prepare it for service. And they continued to bring him freewill (voluntary) offerings every morning. 4And all the skilled men who were doing all the work on the sanctuary came, each one from the work which he was doing, 5and they said to Moses, “The people are bringing much more than enough for the construction work which the LORD commanded us to do.” 6So Moses issued a command, and it was proclaimed throughout the camp, “Let neither man nor woman do any more work for the sanctuary offering.” So the people were restrained from bringing anything more; 7for the material they had was sufficient and more than enough to do all the work.\n\nConstruction Proceeds 8All the skilled men among them who were doing the work on the tabernacle made ten curtains of fine twisted linen and blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, with cherubim [worked into them], the work of an embroiderer, Bezalel made them. 9Each curtain was twenty-eight cubits long and four cubits wide; all the curtains were one size. 10Bezalel joined five curtains one to another, and [the other] five curtains he joined one to another. 11He made loops of blue on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set; he also did this on the edge of the curtain that was outermost in the second set. 12He made fifty loops in the one curtain [of the first set] and fifty loops on the edge of the curtain which was in the second set; the loops were opposite one another. 13He made fifty gold hooks and joined the curtains together with the hooks, so that the tabernacle became a unit.\n\n14Then he made curtains of goats’ hair for a tent over the tabernacle; he made eleven curtains in all. 15Each curtain was thirty cubits long and four cubits wide; the eleven curtains were of equal size. 16Bezalel joined five curtains by themselves and [the other] six curtains by themselves. 17He made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain in the first set, and he made fifty loops on the edge of the outermost curtain of the second set. 18He made fifty bronze hooks to join the tent together into a unit. 19He made a [third] covering for the tent of rams’ skins dyed red, and above it a [fourth] covering of porpoise skins.\n\n20Bezalel made boards of acacia wood for the upright framework of the tabernacle. 21Each board was ten cubits long and one and a half cubits wide. 22Each board had two tenons (dovetails), fitted to one another; he did this for all the boards of the tabernacle. 23And [this is how] he made the boards [for frames] for the tabernacle: twenty boards for the south side; 24and he made under the twenty boards forty silver sockets; two sockets under one board for its two tenons (dovetails), and two sockets under another board for its two tenons. 25For the other side of the tabernacle, the north side, he made twenty boards, 26and their forty silver sockets; two sockets under [the end of] each board. 27And for the rear of the tabernacle, to the west, he made six [frame] boards. 28And he made two boards for each corner of the tabernacle in the rear. 29They were separate below, but linked together at the top with one ring; thus he made both of them in both corners. 30There were eight boards with sixteen silver sockets, and under [the end of] each board two sockets.\n\n31Bezalel made bars of acacia wood, five for the [frame] boards of the one side of the tabernacle, 32and five bars for the boards of the tabernacle’s other side, and five bars for the boards at the rear side to the west. 33And he made the middle bar pass through [horizontally] halfway up the boards from one end to the other. 34He overlaid the boards and the bars with gold and made their rings of gold as holders for the bars.\n\n35Further, Bezalel made the veil of blue and purple and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen; he made it with cherubim, the work of an embroiderer. 36For the veil (partition curtain) he made four support poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold; their hooks were gold, and he cast for them four silver sockets. 37He made a screen (curtain) for the doorway of the tent, of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen, the work of an embroiderer; 38and [he made] the five support poles with their hooks, and overlaid their [ornamental] tops and connecting rings with gold; but their five sockets were bronze.\n\nExodus 37\nConstruction Continues\n\n1Bezalel made the ark [of the covenant] of acacia wood—it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide, and one and a half cubits high. 2And he overlaid it with pure gold inside and out, and made a molding (border) of gold to go all around [the top of it]. 3He cast four rings of gold for it on its four feet, two rings on one side and two rings on the other side. 4He made carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 5He put the carrying poles through the rings at the sides of the ark, to carry it. 6Bezalel made the mercy seat of pure gold; it was two and a half cubits long, and one and a half cubits wide. 7He made two cherubim of hammered gold; he made them at the two ends of the mercy seat, 8one cherub at one end and one cherub at the other end; he made the cherubim [of one piece] with the mercy seat at the two ends. 9The cherubim spread out their wings upward, covering and protecting the mercy seat with their wings, with their faces toward each other; the faces of the cherubim were [looking downward] toward the mercy seat.\n\n10Bezalel made the table [for the bread] of acacia wood; it was two cubits long, a cubit wide, and one and a half cubits high. 11He overlaid it with pure gold, and made a border of gold for it all around [its top]. 12He made a rim for it [just under the top] a hand width wide all around, and a border of gold around its rim. 13He cast four rings of gold for it and fastened the rings to the four corners that were at its four legs. 14Close by the rim were the rings, the holders for the poles [to pass through] to carry the table. 15Bezalel made the carrying poles of acacia wood to carry the table and overlaid them with gold. 16He made the utensils which were to be on the table, its dishes and its pans [for bread], its bowls and its jars for pouring drink offerings, of pure gold.\n\n17Then he made the lampstand (menorah) of pure gold. He made the lampstand of hammered work, its base and its [center] shaft; its cups, its calyxes, and its flowers were all of one piece with it. 18There were six branches coming out of the sides of the lampstand, three branches from one side of the center shaft and three branches from the other side of it; 19three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a calyx and a flower in one branch, and three cups shaped like almond blossoms, a calyx and a flower in the opposite branch—so for the six branches coming out of the center shaft of the lampstand. 20On the center shaft of the lampstand there were four cups shaped like almond blossoms, with calyxes and flowers [one at the top]; 21and a calyx was under the first pair of branches coming out of it, and a calyx under the second pair of branches, coming out of it, and a calyx under the third pair of branches coming out of it, for the six branches coming out of the lampstand. 22Their calyxes and their branches were of one piece with it; all of it was a single hammered work of pure gold. 23He made its seven lamps with its snuffers and its trays of pure gold. 24He made the lampstand and all its utensils from a talent of pure gold.\n\n25Then Bezalel made the incense altar of acacia wood; its top was a cubit square and it was two cubits high; the horns were of one piece with it. 26He overlaid it with pure gold, its top, its sides all around and its horns; he also made a rim of gold around it. 27He made two rings of gold for it under its rim, on its two opposite sides, as holders for the poles [to pass through] to carry it. 28He made the poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with gold. 29He also made the holy anointing oil and the pure, fragrant incense of spices, the work of a perfumer.\n\nExodus 38\nThe Tabernacle Completed\n\n1Then Bezalel made the altar of burnt offering of acacia wood; its top was square, five cubits long and five cubits wide, and three cubits high. 2And he made its horns (horn-shaped projections) on the four corners of it; the horns were of one piece with it, and he overlaid it with bronze. 3He made all the utensils and vessels of the altar [of burnt offering], the pots, shovels, basins [to catch the blood of the sacrificed animal], meat hooks and the firepans [to store live coals]. He made all its utensils of bronze. 4He made for the altar a grating of bronze mesh under its rim, extending halfway up it. 5He cast four rings for the four corners of the bronze grating as holders for the carrying poles. 6And he made the carrying poles of acacia wood and overlaid them with bronze. 7He put the poles through the rings on the sides of the altar, with which to carry it; he made it hollow with planks.\n\n8Bezalel made the basin and its base of bronze from the mirrors of the attending women who served and ministered at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting.\n\n9Then he made the court: for the south side the curtains of the court were of fine twisted linen, a hundred cubits; 10their twenty support poles, and their twenty bronze sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 11And for the north side [of the court the curtains were also] a hundred cubits; their twenty support poles and their twenty bronze sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 12For the west side [of the court] there were curtains of fifty cubits with their ten support poles and their ten sockets; the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were silver. 13For the east side [the front of the courtyard, there were curtains of] fifty cubits. 14The curtains for one side of the court gate were fifteen cubits, with their three support poles and their three sockets; 15and the same for the other side [of the court gate]. Left and right of the court gate there were curtains of fifteen cubits; with their three support poles and their three sockets. 16All the curtains around the court were of fine twisted linen. 17The sockets for the support poles were made of bronze, the hooks of the support poles and their connecting rings were made of silver; and silver overlaid their tops. All the support poles of the court had silver connecting rings. 18The screen (curtain) for the gate of the courtyard [on the east side] was the work of an embroiderer, in blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen; it was twenty cubits long and five cubits high, corresponding to the curtains of the court. 19Their four support poles and their four sockets were bronze; their hooks were silver, and silver overlaid their tops and their connecting rings. 20All the pegs for the tabernacle and the court were bronze.\n\nThe Cost of the Tabernacle 21This is the sum of the things for the tabernacle, the tabernacle of the Testimony, as counted according to the command of Moses, for the work of the Levites, under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron the priest. 22Now Bezalel the son of Uri, the son of Hur, of the tribe of Judah, made everything that the LORD commanded Moses. 23With him was Oholiab the son of Ahisamach, of the tribe of Dan, an engraver and a skillful craftsman and an embroiderer in blue and in purple and in scarlet fabric, and in fine linen.\n\n24All the gold that was used for the work, in all the building and furnishing of the sanctuary, the gold from the wave offering, was twenty-nine talents and seven hundred and thirty shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 25The silver from those of the congregation who were assembled and counted was 100 talents and 1,775 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; 26a beka for each man (that is, half a shekel according to the shekel of the sanctuary) for everyone who was counted, from twenty years old and upward, for 603,550 men. 27The hundred talents of silver were for casting the sockets of the sanctuary and the sockets of the veil (partition curtain); a hundred sockets for the hundred talents, a talent for a socket. 28Of the 1,775 shekels, he made hooks for the support poles and overlaid their tops and made connecting rings for them. 29The bronze of the wave offering was seventy talents and 2,400 shekels. 30With it Bezalel made the sockets for the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, and the bronze altar and its bronze grating, and all the utensils of the altar, 31and the sockets of the court all around and the sockets of the court gate, and all the pegs of the tabernacle and all the pegs around the court.\n\nExodus 39\nThe Priestly Garments\n\n1Moreover, from the blue and purple and scarlet fabric, they made finely woven garments for serving and ministering in the Holy Place; they made the holy garments for Aaron, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n2Bezalel made the ephod of gold, and of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen. 3Then Bezalel and Oholiab hammered the gold [into thin sheets] and cut it into threads to work into the blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and into the fine linen, the work of a skilled craftsman. 4They made attaching shoulder pieces for the ephod; it was attached at its two [upper] edges. 5The skillfully woven sash with which to bind it, which was on the ephod [to hold it in place], was like its workmanship, of the same material: of gold and of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n6They made the onyx stones, set in settings of gold filigree; they were engraved as signets are engraved, with the names of [the twelve tribes of] the sons of Israel. 7And he put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod to be memorial stones (a remembrance) for the sons of Israel (Jacob), just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n8Bezalel made the breastpiece, the work of a skillful craftsman, like the workmanship of the ephod: of gold and of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen. 9It was square; they made the breastpiece folded double, a [hand’s] span long and a [hand’s] span wide when folded double. 10And they mounted four rows of stones on it. The first row was a row of ruby, topaz, and emerald; 11and the second row, a turquoise, a sapphire, and a diamond; 12and the third row, a jacinth, an agate, and an amethyst; 13and the fourth row, a beryl, an onyx, and a jasper; they were mounted in settings of gold filigree. 14The stones corresponded to the names of the sons of Israel; they were twelve [in all], corresponding to their names, engraved like a signet, each with its name, for the twelve tribes. 15And they made on the breastpiece twisted chains like cords of pure gold. 16They made two settings of gold filigree and two gold rings, and put the two rings on the two ends of the breastpiece. 17Then they put the two twisted cords of gold in the two rings on the ends of the breastpiece. 18They put the [other] two ends of the two cords on the two filigree settings, and put them on the shoulder pieces of the ephod at the front of it. 19They made two rings of gold and put them on the two ends of the breastpiece, on its inner edge which was next to the ephod. 20Furthermore, they made two [other] gold rings and attached them to the bottom of the two shoulder pieces of the ephod, at the front of it, close to the place where it is joined, above the woven sash of the ephod. 21They bound the breastpiece by its rings to the rings of the ephod with a blue cord, so that it would lie on the woven sash of the ephod, and so that the breastpiece would not come loose from the ephod, just as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n22Then Bezalel made the robe of the ephod of woven work, all of blue; 23there was an opening [for the head] in the middle of the robe, like the opening in a coat of armor, with a hem around it, so that it would not be frayed or torn. 24On the hem of the robe they made pomegranates of blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, and fine twisted linen. 25They also made bells of pure gold, and put the bells between the pomegranates around the hem of the robe; 26a bell and a pomegranate, a bell and a pomegranate, all [the way] around the hem of the robe, for service and ministering, just as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n27And they made tunics of finely woven linen for Aaron and his sons, 28and the turban of fine linen, and the ornamental caps of fine linen, and the linen undergarments of fine twisted linen, 29and the sash of fine twisted linen, and blue, purple, and scarlet fabric, the work of an embroiderer, just as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n30They made the plate of the holy crown of pure gold, and wrote on it an inscription, like the engravings of a signet, “Holy to the LORD.” 31They tied a blue cord to it, to fasten it on the turban above, just as the LORD commanded Moses.\n\n32Thus all the work of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting was finished; and the Israelites did according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses; that is what they did. 33They brought the tabernacle to Moses [for him to inspect]: the tent and all its furnishings, its hooks, its [frame] boards, its bars, its support poles, its sockets or bases; 34and the covering of rams’ skins dyed red, and the covering of porpoise skins, and the veil (partition) of the screen (curtain); 35the ark of the Testimony, its carrying poles and the mercy seat; 36the table and all its utensils and the bread of the Presence (showbread); 37the pure gold lampstand and its lamps, with the lamps placed in order, all its utensils, and the oil for the light; 38the golden altar [of incense], the anointing oil and the fragrant incense, and the [hanging] veil for the doorway of the tent; 39the bronze altar [of burnt offering] and its grating of bronze, its poles and all its utensils, the basin and its base; 40the curtains of the courtyard, its support poles and sockets, and the screen (curtain) for the courtyard gate, its cords and pegs, and all the utensils for the service of the tabernacle, for the Tent of Meeting [of God with His people]; 41the [finely] woven garments for serving and ministering in the Holy Place, the holy garments for Aaron the priest, and the garments of his sons to minister as priests. 42So the Israelites did all the work according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses. 43And Moses [carefully] inspected all the work, and behold, they had done it; just as the LORD had commanded, so had they done it. So Moses blessed them.\n\nExodus 40\nThe Tabernacle Erected\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“On the first day of the first month (Abib) you shall set up the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting [of God with you]. 3You shall place the ark of the Testimony there, and you shall screen off the ark [from the Holy Place of God’s Presence] with the veil (partition curtain). 4You shall bring in the table [for the bread] and arrange its setting; you shall bring in the lampstand and mount and light its lamps. 5You shall set the golden altar of incense in front of the ark of the Testimony [outside the veil], and put the [hanging] veil at the doorway of the tabernacle. 6You shall set the [bronze] altar of burnt offering in front of the doorway of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting. 7You shall set the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar [of burnt offering], and put water in it. 8You shall set up the courtyard [curtains] all around and hang up the screen (curtain) for the gateway of the courtyard. 9Then you shall take the anointing oil and anoint the tabernacle and all that is in it, and consecrate it and all its furniture; and it shall be holy (declared sacred, separated from secular use). 10You shall anoint the altar of burnt offering and all its utensils, and consecrate the altar, and the altar shall be most holy. 11You shall anoint the basin and its base, and consecrate it. 12Then you shall bring Aaron and his sons to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting and wash them with water. 13You shall put the holy garments on Aaron and anoint him and consecrate him, that he may serve as a priest to Me. 14You shall bring his sons and put tunics on them; 15you shall anoint them just as you anointed their father, so that they may serve as priests to Me; and their anointing shall qualify them for an everlasting priesthood throughout their generations.” 16Thus Moses did; in accordance with all that the LORD commanded him, so he did.\n\n17Now it happened on the first day of the first month (Abib) in the second year [after the exodus from Egypt], that the tabernacle was erected. 18Moses erected the tabernacle, laid its sockets, set up its boards, put in its bars and erected its support poles. 19He spread the tent over the tabernacle and put the covering of the tent over it, just as the LORD had commanded him. 20He took the Testimony [the stones inscribed with the Ten Commandments] and put it into the ark [of the covenant], and placed the poles [through the rings] on the ark, and put the mercy seat on top of the ark. 21Moses brought the ark into the tabernacle, and set up a veil (partition) for the screen (curtain), and screened off the ark of the Testimony, just as the LORD had commanded him. 22Then he put the table in the Tent of Meeting on the north side of the tabernacle, outside the veil. 23He set the bread [of the Presence] in order on it before the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded him. 24Then he put the lampstand in the Tent of Meeting, opposite the table, on the south side of the tabernacle. 25Moses mounted and lighted the lamps [on the lampstand] before the LORD, just as the LORD commanded him. 26He put the golden altar [of incense] in the Tent of Meeting in front of the veil; 27he burned fragrant incense [as a symbol of prayer] on it, just as the LORD commanded him. 28Then he set up the screen (curtain) at the doorway of the tabernacle. 29He set the altar of burnt offering before the doorway of the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting, and offered on it the burnt offering and the grain offering, just as the LORD commanded him. 30He placed the basin between the Tent of Meeting and the altar [of burnt offering], and put water in it for washing. 31Then from it Moses and Aaron and his sons washed their hands and their feet. 32When they entered the Tent of Meeting, and when they approached the altar, they washed, just as the LORD commanded Moses. 33And he erected the courtyard all around the tabernacle and the altar, and hung the screen (curtain) at the gateway of the courtyard. So Moses finished the work.\n\nThe Glory of the LORD 34Then the cloud [the Shekinah, God’s visible, dwelling presence] covered the Tent of Meeting, and the glory and brilliance of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 35Moses was not able to enter the Tent of Meeting because the cloud remained on it, and the glory and brilliance of the LORD filled the tabernacle. 36In all their journeys, whenever the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the Israelites would set out; 37but if the cloud was not taken up, then they did not journey on until the day when it was taken up. 38For throughout all their journeys, the cloud of the LORD was on the tabernacle by day, and there was fire in it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel.\n\nShare this:"

The priest shall offer all of it up in smoke on the altar as a burnt offering. It is an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD.\n\n10‘But if his offering is from the flock, of the sheep or of the goats, as a burnt offering, he shall offer a male without blemish. 11‘He shall kill it on the north side of the altar before the LORD, and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 12‘He shall cut it into pieces, with its head and its fat, and the priest shall arrange them on the wood which is on the fire that is on the altar. 13‘But he shall wash the entrails and legs with water. The priest shall offer all of it, and offer it up in smoke on the altar. It is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD.\n\n14‘But if his offering to the LORD is a burnt offering of birds, then he shall bring turtledoves or young pigeons as his offering. 15‘The priest shall bring it to the altar, and wring off its head, and offer it up in smoke on the altar; and its blood is to be drained out on the side of the altar. 16‘He shall remove its crop with its feathers and throw it next to the east side of the altar, in the place for ashes. 17‘Then he shall tear it open by its wings, but shall not sever it. And the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, on the wood that is on the fire. It is a burnt offering, an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD.\n\nLeviticus 2\nThe Law Of Grain Offerings\n\n1‘When anyone presents a grain offering to the Lord, his offering shall be of fine flour, and he shall pour [olive] oil over it and put frankincense on it. 2‘He shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests. Out of it he shall take a handful of the fine flour and oil, with all of its frankincense, and the priest shall offer this up in smoke on the altar [of burnt offering] as the memorial portion of it. It is an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 3‘What is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings to the LORD by fire.\n\n4‘When you bring an offering of grain baked in the oven, it shall be unleavened cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, or unleavened wafers spread with oil. 5‘If your offering is grain baked on a griddle, it shall be of fine unleavened flour, mixed with oil. 6‘You are to break it into pieces, and you shall pour oil on it; it is a grain offering. 7‘Now if your offering is grain cooked in a lidded pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil. 8‘When you bring the grain offering that is made of these things to the LORD, it shall be presented to the priest, and he shall bring it to the altar [of burnt offering]. 9‘The priest shall take from the grain offering its memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar. It is an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 10‘What is left of the grain offering belongs to Aaron and his sons; it is a most holy part of the offerings to the LORD by fire.\n\n11‘No grain offering that you bring to the LORD shall be made with leaven, for you shall not offer up in smoke any leaven [which symbolizes the spread of sin] or any honey [which, like leaven, is subject to fermentation] in any offering by fire to the LORD. 12‘As an offering of first fruits you may offer them [leaven and honey] to the LORD, but they shall not go up [in smoke] on the altar as a sweet and soothing aroma. 13‘You shall season every grain offering with salt so that the salt (preservation) of the covenant of your God will not be missing from your grain offering. You shall offer salt with all your offerings.\n\n14‘If you bring a grain offering of early ripened things to the LORD, you shall bring fresh heads of grain roasted in the fire, crushed grain of new growth, for the grain offering of your early ripened things. 15‘You shall put oil on it and lay incense on it; it is a grain offering. 16‘The priest shall offer up in smoke its memorial portion, part of the crushed grain and part of its oil with all its incense; it is an offering by fire to the LORD.\n\nLeviticus 3\nThe Law Of Peace Offerings\n\n1‘If a man’s offering is a sacrifice of peace offerings, if he offers an animal from the herd, whether male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD. 2‘He shall lay his hand on the head of his offering [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice] and kill it at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting; and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood around on the altar. 3‘From the sacrifice of the peace offerings, an offering by fire to the LORD, he shall present the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails, 4and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the lobe of the liver which he shall remove with the kidneys. 5‘Aaron’s sons shall offer it up in smoke on the altar [placing it] on the burnt offering which is on the wood that is on the fire. It is an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 6‘If his peace offering to the LORD is an animal from the flock, male or female, he shall offer the animal without blemish. 7‘If he offers a lamb as his offering, then he shall present it before the LORD, 8and he shall lay his hand on the head of his offering and kill it before the Tent of Meeting, and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 9‘From the sacrifice of peace offerings he shall bring as an offering by fire to the LORD, its fat, the entire fat tail which he shall remove close to the backbone, and the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails, 10and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. 11‘The priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as food, an offering by fire to the LORD.\n\n12‘If his offering is a goat, he shall present it before the LORD, 13and he shall lay his hand on its head [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice], and kill it before the Tent of Meeting; and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 14‘Then he shall present from it as his offering, an offering by fire to the LORD: the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat that is on the entrails, 15and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the lobe of the liver which he shall remove with the kidneys. 16‘The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as food. It is an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma; all the fat is the LORD’S. 17‘It is a permanent statute for your generations wherever you may be, that you shall not eat any fat or any blood.’”\n\nLeviticus 4\nThe Law Of Sin Offerings\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel, ‘If a person sins unintentionally in any of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and commits any of them— 3if the anointed priest sins, bringing guilt on the people, then he shall offer to the LORD a young bull without blemish as a sin offering for the sin he has committed. 4‘He shall bring the bull to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting before the LORD, and shall lay his hand on the bull’s head [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice] and kill the bull before the LORD. 5‘Then the anointed priest is to take some of the bull’s blood and bring it into the Tent of Meeting; 6and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood and sprinkle some of it seven times before the LORD in front of the veil (curtain) of the sanctuary. 7‘The priest shall also put some of the blood on the horns of the altar of fragrant incense which is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting. All the rest of the blood of the bull he shall pour out at the base of the altar of the burnt offering which is at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 8‘He shall remove all the fat from the bull of the sin offering—the fat that covers the entrails, and all the fat which is on the entrails, 9and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys 10(just as these are removed from the ox of the sacrifice of peace offerings), and the priest is to offer them up in smoke on the altar of burnt offering. 11‘But the hide of the bull and all its meat, with its head, its legs, its entrails, and its refuse, 12that is, all the rest of the bull, he is to bring outside the camp to a clean place where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on a fire of wood. Where the ashes are poured out it shall be burned.\n\n13‘Now if the whole congregation of Israel sins unintentionally, and the matter escapes the notice of the assembly, and they have done any one of the things which the LORD has commanded not to be done, and they become guilty; 14when the sin which they have committed becomes known, then the congregation shall offer a young bull of the herd as a sin offering and bring it before the Tent of Meeting. 15‘Then the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands on the head of the bull before the LORD [to transfer symbolically the congregation’s guilt to the sacrifice], and they shall kill the bull before the LORD. 16‘The anointed priest is to bring some of the bull’s blood to the Tent of Meeting, 17and the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle it seven times before the LORD, in front of the veil [which screens off the Holy of Holies and the ark of the covenant]. 18‘He shall put some of the blood on the horns of the altar [of incense] which is before the LORD in the Tent of Meeting; and he shall pour out all the rest of the blood at the base of the altar of burnt offering which is at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 19‘He shall remove all its fat from the bull and offer it up in smoke on the altar. 20‘He shall also do with the bull just as he did with the bull of the sin offering; that is what he shall do with this. So the priest shall make atonement for [the sin of] the people, and they will be forgiven. 21‘Then the priest is to bring the bull outside the camp and burn it as he burned the first bull; it is the sin offering for the congregation.\n\n22‘When a ruler or leader sins and unintentionally does any one of the things the LORD his God has commanded not to be done, and he becomes guilty, 23if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, he shall bring a goat, a male without blemish as his offering. 24‘He shall lay his hand on the head of the male goat [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice], and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD; it is a sin offering. 25‘Then the priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering; and the rest of its blood he shall pour out at the base of the altar of burnt offering. 26‘And he shall offer all its fat up in smoke on the altar like the fat from the sacrifice of peace offerings; so the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to his sin, and he will be forgiven.\n\n27‘If anyone of the common people sins unintentionally by doing any of the things the LORD has commanded not to be done, and becomes guilty, 28if his sin which he has committed is made known to him, then he shall bring a goat, a female without blemish as his offering for the sin which he has committed. 29‘He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice], and kill it at the place of the burnt offering. 30‘The priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and shall pour out all the rest of its blood at the base of the altar. 31‘Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat was removed from the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. In this way the priest shall make atonement for him, and he will be forgiven.\n\n32‘If he brings a lamb as his offering for a sin offering, he shall bring a female without blemish. 33‘He shall lay his hand on the head of the sin offering [transferring symbolically his guilt to the sacrifice], and kill it as a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering. 34‘The priest is to take some of the blood of the sin offering with his finger and put it on the horns of the altar of burnt offering and all the rest of the blood of the lamb he shall pour out at the base of the altar. 35‘Then he shall remove all its fat, just as the fat of the lamb is removed from the sacrifice of the peace offerings, and the priest shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, on the offerings by fire to the LORD. In this way the priest shall make atonement for him in regard to the sin which he has committed, and he will be forgiven.\n\nLeviticus 5\nThe Law Of Guilt Offerings\n\n1‘If anyone sins after he hears a public adjuration (solemn command to testify) when he is a witness, whether he has seen or [otherwise] known [something]—if he fails to report it, then he will bear his guilt and be held responsible. 2‘Or if someone touches any [ceremonially] unclean thing—whether the carcass of an unclean wild animal or the carcass of an unclean domestic animal or the carcass of unclean creeping things—even if he is unaware of it, he has become unclean, and he will be guilty. 3‘Or if he touches human uncleanness—whatever kind it may be—and he becomes unclean, but he is unaware of it, when he recognizes it, he will be guilty. 4‘Or if anyone swears [an oath] thoughtlessly or impulsively aloud that he will do either evil or good, in whatever manner a person may speak thoughtlessly or impulsively with an oath, but he is unaware of it, when he recognizes it, he will be guilty in one of these. 5‘So it shall be when a person is guilty in one of these, that he shall confess the sin he has committed. 6‘He shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD for the sin which he has committed, a female from the flock, a lamb or a goat as a sin offering. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for his sin.\n\n7‘But if he cannot afford a lamb, then he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons as his guilt offering for his sin to the LORD, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. 8‘He shall bring them to the priest, who shall offer first the one for the sin offering, and shall nip its head at the front of its neck, but shall not sever it [completely]. 9‘He shall also sprinkle some of the blood of the sin offering on the side of the altar, and the rest of the blood shall be drained out at the base of the altar; it is a sin offering. 10‘The second [bird] he shall prepare as a burnt offering, according to the ordinance. So the priest shall make atonement on his behalf for the sin which he has committed, and it will be forgiven him.\n\n11‘But if he cannot afford to bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons, then he shall bring as his offering for his sin the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour as a sin offering; he shall not put [olive] oil or incense on it, for it is a sin offering. 12‘He shall bring it to the priest, who shall take a handful of it as a memorial portion and offer it up in smoke on the altar, with the offerings by fire to the LORD; it is a sin offering. 13‘In this way the priest shall make atonement for him for the sin which he has committed in one of these things, and it will be forgiven him; then the rest shall be for the priest, like the grain offering.’”\n\n14Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 15“If a person commits a breach of faith and sins unintentionally against the holy things of the LORD, then he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish from the flock, valued by you in shekels of silver, that is, the shekel of the sanctuary, as a guilt offering. 16He shall make restitution for the sin which he has committed against the holy thing, and shall add a fifth [of the ram’s value] to it, and give it to the priest. The priest shall then make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering, and he shall be forgiven.\n\n17“Now if anyone sins and does any of the things which the LORD has forbidden, though he was not aware of it, still he is guilty and shall bear his punishment. 18He is then to bring to the priest a ram without blemish from the flock, according to your valuation, for a guilt offering. In this way the priest shall make atonement for him regarding the error which he committed unintentionally and did not know it, and he shall be forgiven. 19“It is a guilt offering; he was certainly guilty before the LORD.”\n\nLeviticus 6\nGuilt Offerings\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“When anyone sins and acts unfaithfully against the LORD by deceiving his neighbor (companion, associate) in regard to a deposit or a security entrusted to him, or through robbery, or if he has extorted from his neighbor, 3or has found what was lost and lied about it and sworn falsely, so that he sins in regard to any one of the things a man may do— 4then if he has sinned and is guilty, he shall restore what he took by robbery, or what he got by extortion, or the deposit which was entrusted to him, or the lost thing which he found, 5or anything about which he has sworn falsely; he shall not only restore it in full, but shall add to it one-fifth more. He shall give it to the one to whom it belongs on the day of his guilt offering. 6Then he shall bring to the priest his guilt offering to the LORD, a ram without blemish from the flock, as valued by you, as a guilt offering. 7“The priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD, and he will be forgiven for any one of the things which he may have done to incur guilt.”\n\nThe Priest’s Part in the Offerings 8Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 9“Command Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the burnt offering: the burnt offering shall remain on the hearth that is on the altar all night until morning and the fire is to be kept burning on the altar. 10‘The priest is to put on his linen robe, with his linen undergarments next to his body. Then he shall take up the ashes of the burnt offering which the fire has consumed on the altar and put them beside the altar. 11‘Then he shall take off his garments and put on something else, and take the ashes outside the camp to a (ceremonially) clean place. 12‘The fire on the altar shall be kept burning; it shall not [be allowed to] go out. The priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and he shall arrange the burnt offering on it and offer the fat portions of the peace offerings up in smoke on it. 13‘The fire shall be burning continually on the altar; it shall not [be allowed to] go out.\n\n14‘Now this is the law of the grain offering: the sons of Aaron shall present it before the LORD in front of the altar. 15‘One of them shall take up from it a handful of the fine flour of the grain offering with its oil and all the incense that is on the grain offering, and he shall offer it up in smoke on the altar, a sweet and soothing aroma, as the memorial offering to the LORD. 16‘What is left of it Aaron and his sons are to eat. It shall be eaten as unleavened bread in a holy place; they are to eat it in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. 17‘It shall not be baked with leaven [which represents corruption or sin]. I have given it as their share of My offerings by fire; it is most holy, like the sin offering and the guilt offering. 18‘Every male among the sons of Aaron may eat it [as his share]; it is a permanent ordinance throughout your generations, from offerings by fire to the LORD. Whatever touches them will become consecrated (ceremonially clean).’”\n\n19Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 20“This is the offering which Aaron and his sons are to present to the LORD on the day when he is anointed: the tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a regular grain offering, half of it in the morning and half of it in the evening. 21It shall be prepared with oil on a griddle. When it is well stirred, you shall bring it. You shall present the grain offering in baked pieces as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 22The priest from among the sons of Aaron who is anointed in his place shall offer it. By a permanent statute it shall be entirely offered up in smoke to the LORD. 23“So every grain offering of the priest shall be burned entirely. It shall not be eaten.”\n\n24Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 25“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the law of the sin offering: the sin offering shall be killed before the LORD in the [same] place where the burnt offering is killed; it is most holy. 26‘The priest who offers it for sin shall eat it. It shall be eaten in a holy place, in the courtyard of the Tent of Meeting. 27‘Whatever touches its meat will become consecrated (ceremonially clean). When any of its blood splashes on a garment, you shall wash what was splashed on in a holy place. 28‘Also the earthenware vessel in which it was boiled shall be broken; and if it was boiled in a bronze vessel, then that vessel shall be scoured and rinsed in water. 29‘Every male among the priests may eat this offering; it is most holy. 30‘But no sin offering from which any of the blood is brought into the Tent of Meeting to make atonement in the Holy Place shall be eaten; it shall be [completely] burned in the fire.\n\nLeviticus 7\nThe Priest’s Part In The Offerings\n\n1‘This is the law of the guilt offering; it is most holy. 2‘In the place where they kill the burnt offering they are to kill the guilt offering, and he shall sprinkle its blood around on the altar. 3‘Then he shall offer all its fat, the fat tail and the fat that covers the entrails, 4and the two kidneys with the fat that is on them at the loins, and the lobe of the liver, which he shall remove with the kidneys. 5‘The priest shall offer them up in smoke on the altar as an offering by fire to the LORD; it is a guilt offering. 6‘Every male among the priests may eat it; it shall be eaten in a holy place; it is most holy. 7‘The guilt offering is like the sin offering, there is one law for [both of] them: the priest who makes atonement with it shall have it for himself. 8‘The priest who presents any man’s burnt offering shall have for himself the hide of the burnt offering which he has presented. 9‘Likewise, every grain offering that is baked in the oven and everything that is prepared in a pan or on a griddle shall belong to the priest who presents it. 10‘Every grain offering, mixed with [olive] oil or dry, all the sons of Aaron may have, one as well as another.\n\n11‘Now this is the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings which shall be presented to the LORD: 12‘If one offers it as a sacrificial meal of thanksgiving, then along with the sacrifice of thanksgiving he shall offer unleavened cakes mixed with oil, and unleavened wafers spread with oil, and cakes of fine flour mixed with oil. 13‘With the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving, he shall present his offering with cakes of leavened bread. 14‘Of this he shall present one [cake] from each offering as a contribution to the LORD; it shall belong to the priest who sprinkles the blood of the peace offerings.\n\n15‘The meat of the sacrifice of thanksgiving presented as a peace offering shall be eaten on the day that it is offered; none of it shall be left until morning. 16‘But if the sacrifice of his offering is a vow or a freewill offering, it shall be eaten on the day that he offers his sacrifice, and on the next day that which remains of it may be eaten; 17but what is left over from the meat of the sacrifice on the third day shall be [completely] burned in the fire. 18‘If any of the meat of the sacrifice of his peace offerings is ever eaten on the third day, then it will not be accepted, and the one who brought it will not be credited with it. It shall be an abhorred (offensive) thing; the one who eats it shall bear his own guilt.\n\n19‘The meat that comes in contact with anything that is unclean shall not be eaten; it shall be burned in the fire. As for other meat, everyone who is [ceremonially] clean may eat it. 20‘But the one who eats meat from the sacrifice of peace offerings which belong to the LORD, in his uncleanness, that person shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 21‘When anyone touches any unclean thing—human uncleanness, or an unclean animal, or any unclean detestable thing—and then eats the meat of the sacrifice of the LORD’S peace offerings, that person shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them].’”\n\n22Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 23“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘You shall not eat any fat from an ox, a sheep, or a goat. 24‘The fat of an animal which dies [of natural causes] and the fat of one which is torn [to pieces by a predator] may be put to any other use, but under no circumstances are you to eat it. 25‘For whoever eats the fat of the animal from which an offering by fire is presented to the LORD, that person who eats shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 26‘Moreover, you are not to eat any blood [of any kind], whether of bird or animal, in any of your dwelling places. 27‘Whoever eats any blood, that person shall be cut off from his people.’”\n\n28Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 29“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘He who offers the sacrifice of his peace offerings to the LORD shall bring his offering to the LORD from the sacrifice of his peace offerings. 30‘With his own hands he is to bring offerings by fire to the LORD; he shall bring the fat with the breast, so that the breast may be presented as a wave offering before the LORD. 31‘The priest shall offer up the fat in smoke on the altar, but the breast shall be for Aaron and his sons. 32‘You shall give the right thigh to the priest as a contribution from the sacrifices of your peace offerings. 33‘The son of Aaron who offers the blood of the peace offerings and the fat shall have the right thigh as his portion. 34‘For I have taken the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering from the Israelites, from the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and I have given them to Aaron the priest and to his sons as their perpetual portion from the Israelites.\n\n35‘This is the consecrated portion from the offerings by fire to the LORD that was designated for Aaron and his sons on the day he presented them to serve as priests to the LORD. 36‘The LORD commanded this to be given to the priests by the Israelites on the day that He anointed them. It is their portion perpetually throughout their generations.’”\n\n37This is the law of the burnt offering, the grain offering, the sin offering, the guilt offering, the consecration (ordination) offering, and the sacrifice of peace offerings, 38which the LORD commanded Moses at Mount Sinai on the day He commanded the Israelites to present their offerings to the LORD, in the Wilderness of Sinai.\n\nLeviticus 8\nThe Consecration Of Aaron And His Sons\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments [which are symbols of their office], and the anointing oil, and the bull for the sin offering, and the two rams, and the basket of unleavened bread; 3and assemble the entire congregation at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting.” 4Moses did as the LORD commanded him, and the congregation was assembled at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 5Moses said to the congregation, “This is what the LORD has commanded us to do.”\n\n6Then Moses brought Aaron and his sons and washed them with water. 7He put the undertunic on Aaron, tied the sash around him, clothed him in the robe, and put the ephod (an upper vestment) on him. He tied the [skillfully woven] band of the ephod around him, with which he secured it to Aaron. 8Moses then put the breastpiece on Aaron, and he put in the breastpiece the Urim and the Thummim [the sacred articles the high priest used when seeking God’s will concerning the nation]. 9He also put the turban on Aaron’s head, and on it, in the front, Moses placed the golden plate, the holy crown, just as the LORD had commanded him.\n\n10Then Moses took the anointing oil and anointed the tabernacle and all that was in it, and consecrated them. 11He sprinkled some of the oil on the altar seven times and anointed the altar and all its utensils, and the basin and its stand, to consecrate them. 12Then he poured some of the anointing oil on Aaron’s head and anointed him, to consecrate him. 13Next Moses brought Aaron’s sons forward, put undertunics on them, belted them with sashes, and bound caps on them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n14Then he brought the bull for the sin offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the bull. 15Next Moses killed it and took the blood and with his finger put some of it around on the horns of the altar and purified it [from sin]. Then he poured out the rest of the blood at the base of the altar and consecrated it, to make atonement for it. 16He took all the fat that was on the entrails, and the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys with their fat, and Moses offered them up in smoke on the altar. 17But the bull (the sin offering) and its hide, its meat, and its refuse he burned in the fire outside the camp, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n18He brought the ram for the burnt offering, and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 19Moses killed it and sprinkled the blood around on the altar. 20When he had cut the ram into pieces, Moses offered up the head, the pieces, and the fat in smoke. 21After he had washed the entrails and the legs in water, Moses offered up the whole ram in smoke on the altar. It was a burnt offering for a sweet and soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n22Then he brought the second ram, the ram of consecration (ordination), and Aaron and his sons laid their hands on the head of the ram. 23Moses killed it and took some of its blood and put it on the lobe of Aaron’s right ear, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 24He also brought Aaron’s sons forward and put some of the blood on the lobes of their right ears, and the thumbs of their right hands, and the big toes of their right feet; and Moses sprinkled the rest of the blood around on the altar. 25He took the fat, the fat tail, all the fat that was on the entrails, the lobe of the liver, and the two kidneys and their fat, and the right thigh; 26and from the basket of unleavened bread that was before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer and put them on the fat and on the right thigh; 27and he put all these things in Aaron’s hands and his sons’ hands and presented them as a wave offering before the LORD. 28Then Moses took these things from their hands and offered them up in smoke on the altar with the burnt offering. They were a consecration (ordination) offering for a sweet and soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 29Moses also took the breast and presented it as a wave offering before the LORD; it was Moses’ portion of the ram of consecration (ordination), just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n30So Moses took some of the anointing oil and some of the blood which was on the altar and sprinkled it on Aaron and his garments, and also on his sons and their garments with him; so Moses consecrated Aaron and his garments, and his sons and his sons’ garments with him.\n\n31Then Moses said to Aaron and to his sons, “Boil the meat at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting and eat it there together with the bread that is in the basket of the consecration (ordination) offering, just as I commanded, saying, ‘Aaron and his sons shall eat it.’ 32And what remains of the meat and of the bread you shall burn in the fire. 33You shall not go outside the doorway of the Tent of Meeting for seven days, until the days of your consecration (ordination) are ended; for it will take seven days to consecrate you. 34As has been done this day, so the LORD has commanded to do for your atonement. 35“You shall remain day and night for seven days at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, doing what the Lord has required you to do, so that you will not die; for so I (Moses) have been commanded.” 36So Aaron and his sons did all the things which the LORD had commanded through Moses.\n\nLeviticus 9\nAaron Offers Sacrifices\n\n1And it happened on the eighth day that Moses called Aaron and his sons and the elders of Israel; 2and he said to Aaron, “Take a bull calf as a sin offering and a ram as a burnt offering, [each] without blemish, and offer both before the LORD. 3Then say to the Israelites, ‘Take a male goat as a sin offering, and a calf and a lamb, both one year old, without blemish, as a burnt offering, 4and a bull and a ram as peace offerings to sacrifice before the LORD, and a grain offering mixed with [olive] oil, for today the LORD will appear to you.’” 5So they took what Moses had commanded to the front of the Tent of Meeting, and all the congregation approached and stood before the LORD. 6Moses said, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded you to do, so that the glory of the LORD may appear to you.” 7Moses said to Aaron, “Approach the altar and present your sin offering and your burnt offering and make atonement for yourself and for the people; and present the offering of the people and make atonement for them, just as the LORD has commanded.”\n\n8So Aaron approached the altar and killed the calf as the sin offering, which was designated for himself. 9The sons of Aaron presented the blood to him; he dipped his finger in the blood and put some of it on the horns of the altar, and poured out the rest of the blood at the altar’s base; 10but the fat, the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver from the sin offering he offered up in smoke on the altar, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 11And Aaron burned the meat and the hide in the fire outside the camp.\n\n12Then he killed the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar. 13They brought the burnt offering to him piece by piece, with the head, and Aaron offered them up in smoke on the altar. 14He also washed the entrails and the legs, and offered them up in smoke with the burnt offering on the altar.\n\n15Then Aaron presented the people’s offering. He took the goat for the sin offering of the people, and killed it and offered it for sin, as he did the first. 16He also presented the burnt offering and offered it according to the ordinance. 17Next Aaron presented the grain offering and took a handful of it and offered it up in smoke on the altar in addition to the burnt offering of the morning.\n\n18He also killed the bull and the ram, the sacrifice of peace offerings which was for the people; and Aaron’s sons handed the blood to him and he sprinkled it around on the altar, 19As for the portions of fat from the bull and from the ram—the fat tail, and the fat covering the internal organs, and the kidneys, and the lobe of the liver— 20they now put the portions of fat on the breasts; and Aaron offered the fat up in smoke on the altar. 21But the breasts and the right thigh Aaron presented as a wave offering before the LORD, just as Moses had commanded.\n\n22Then Aaron lifted his hands toward the people and blessed them, and came down [from the altar of burnt offering] after presenting the sin offering, the burnt offering, and the peace offerings. 23Moses and Aaron went into the Tent of Meeting, and when they came out they blessed the people, and the glory and brilliance of the LORD [the Shekinah cloud] appeared to all the people [as promised]. 24Then fire came out from before the LORD and consumed the burnt offering and the portions of fat on the altar; and when all the people saw it, they shouted and fell face downward [in awe and worship].\n\nLeviticus 10\nThe Sin Of Nadab And Abihu\n\n1Now Nadab and Abihu, the sons of Aaron, took their respective [ceremonial] censers, put fire in them, placed incense on it and offered strange (unauthorized, unacceptable) fire before the LORD, [an act] which He had not commanded them to do. 2And fire came out from the presence of the LORD and devoured them, and they died before the LORD. 3Then Moses said to Aaron, “This is what the LORD said:\n‘I will be treated as holy by those who approach Me,\nAnd before all the people I will be honored.’”\nSo Aaron, therefore, said nothing.\n\n4Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel who was Aaron’s uncle, and said to them, “Come here, carry your relatives away from the front of the sanctuary and take them outside the camp.” 5So they came forward and carried them, still in their undertunics, outside the camp, as Moses had said. 6Then Moses said to Aaron and to his [younger] sons Eleazar and Ithamar, “Do not uncover your heads nor let your hair hang loose nor tear your clothes [as expressions of mourning], so that you will not die [also] and so that He will not express His wrath and anger toward all the congregation. But your relatives, the whole house of Israel, may mourn the burning which the LORD has brought about. 7“You shall not even go out of the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, or you will die; for the LORD’S anointing oil is upon you.” So they did [everything] according to the word of Moses.\n\n8Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, saying, 9“Do not drink wine or intoxicating drink, neither you nor your sons with you, when you come into the Tent of Meeting, so that you will not die—it is a permanent statute throughout your generations— 10and to make a distinction and recognize a difference between the holy (sacred) and the common (profane), and between the [ceremonially] unclean and the clean; 11and you are to teach the Israelites all the statutes which the LORD has spoken to them through Moses.”\n\n12Then Moses said to Aaron, and to his surviving sons, Eleazar and Ithamar, “Take the grain offering that is left over from the offerings by fire to the LORD, and eat it unleavened beside the altar, for it is most holy. 13You shall eat it in a holy place, because it is your portion and your sons’ portion, from the offerings by fire to the LORD; for so I have been commanded. 14But the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering you may eat in a clean place, you and your sons and daughters with you; for the breast and the thigh are your portion and your sons’ portion, given out of the sacrifices of the peace offerings of the Israelites. 15“They shall bring the thigh presented by lifting up and the breast presented by waving, along with the offerings by fire of the fat, to present as a wave offering before the LORD. This shall be yours and your sons’ with you, as your perpetual portion, just as the LORD has commanded.”\n\n16But Moses diligently tried to find the goat [that had been offered] as the sin offering, and discovered that it had been burned up [as waste, not eaten]! So he was angry with Aaron’s surviving sons Eleazar and Ithamar, saying, 17“Why did you not eat the sin offering in the holy place? For it is most holy; and God gave it to you to remove the guilt of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD. 18“Behold, its blood was not brought into the Holy Place; you certainly should have eaten the goat in the sanctuary, just as I commanded.” 19Then Aaron said to Moses, “This very day they have [obediently] presented their sin offering and their burnt offering before the LORD, but [such terrible things] as these have happened to me [and to them]; if I [and my sons] had eaten a sin offering today would it have been acceptable and pleasing in the sight of the LORD?” 20When Moses heard that, he was satisfied.\n\nLeviticus 11\nLaws About Animals For Food\n\n1The LORD spoke again to Moses and Aaron, saying to them, 2“Speak to the children of Israel, saying, ‘Among all the animals which are on the earth, these are the animals which you may eat. 3‘You may eat any animal that has a divided hoof [that is, a hoof split into two parts especially at its distal extremity] and chews the cud. 4‘Nevertheless, you are not to eat these, among those which chew the cud or divide the hoof: the camel, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof; it is [ceremonially] unclean to you. 5‘And the shaphan, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you. 6‘And the hare, because it chews the cud but does not divide the hoof; it is unclean to you. 7‘And the swine, because it divides the hoof and makes a split hoof, but does not chew the cud; it is unclean to you. 8‘You shall not eat their meat nor touch their carcasses; they are unclean to you.\n\n9‘These you may eat, whatever is in the water: whatever has fins and scales in the waters, in the seas, and in the rivers, these you may eat; 10but whatever does not have fins and scales in the seas and in the rivers, of all the teeming life in the waters, and of all the living creatures that are in the waters, they are [to be considered] detestable to you. 11‘They shall be hated things to you. You may not eat their meat; you shall detest their carcasses. 12‘Everything in the water that does not have fins and scales is detestable to you.\n\nAvoid the Unclean 13‘These you shall detest among the birds; they are not to be eaten, for they are hated things: the eagle and the vulture and the buzzard, 14the kite, every kind of falcon, 15every kind of raven, 16the ostrich, the nighthawk, the sea gull, every species of hawk, 17the little owl and the cormorant and the great owl, 18the white owl, the pelican, the carrion vulture, 19the stork, all kinds of heron, the hoopoe, and the bat.\n\n20‘All winged insects that walk on all fours are detestable to you; 21yet of all winged insects that walk on all fours you may eat those which have legs above their feet with which to leap on the ground. 22‘Of these you may eat: the whole species of migratory locust, of bald locust, of cricket, and of grasshopper. 23‘But all other winged insects which are four footed are detestable to you.\n\n24‘By [contact with] these you will become unclean; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until the evening (dusk), 25and whoever picks up any of their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening. 26‘Concerning all the animals which divide the hoof, but do not have a split hoof, or which do not chew the cud, they are unclean to you; whoever touches them becomes unclean. 27‘Also all animals that walk on their paws, among all kinds of animals that walk on four legs, are unclean to you; whoever touches their carcasses becomes unclean until the evening, 28and the one who picks up their carcasses shall wash his clothes and be unclean until the evening; they are unclean to you.\n\n29‘These also are unclean to you among the swarming things that crawl around on the ground [and multiply profusely]: the mole, the mouse, and any kind of great lizard, 30the gecko, the crocodile, the lizard, the sand reptile, and the chameleon. 31‘These [creatures] are unclean to you among all that swarm; whoever touches them when they are dead becomes unclean until evening. 32‘Also anything on which one of them falls after dying becomes unclean, whether it is an article of wood or clothing, or a skin, or a sack—any article that is used—it must be put in water, and will be unclean until the evening; then it becomes clean. 33‘As for any earthenware container into which any of these [crawling things] falls, whatever is in it becomes unclean, and you shall break the container. 34‘Any of the food which may be eaten, but on which [unclean] water falls, shall become unclean, and any liquid that may be drunk in every container shall become unclean. 35‘Everything that part of their carcass falls on becomes unclean; an oven, or a small stove shall be smashed; they are unclean, and shall be unclean to you. 36‘Nevertheless a spring or a cistern (reservoir) collecting water shall be clean; but whoever touches one of these carcasses shall be unclean. 37‘If a part of their carcass falls on any seed for sowing which is to be sown, it is clean; 38but if water is put on the seed and a part of their carcass falls on it, it is unclean to you.\n\n39‘If one of the animals that you may eat dies [of natural causes], whoever touches its carcass becomes unclean until the evening. 40‘And whoever eats some of its meat shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening; also whoever picks up its carcass shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until the evening.\n\n41‘Now everything that swarms on the ground is detestable; it is not to be eaten. 42‘Whatever crawls on its belly, and whatever walks on all fours, and whatever has many feet among all things that swarm on the ground, you shall not eat; for they are detestable. 43‘Do not make yourselves loathsome (impure, repulsive) by [eating] any swarming thing; you shall not make yourselves unclean by them so as to defile yourselves. 44‘For I am the LORD your God; so consecrate yourselves and be holy, for I am holy. You shall not make yourselves unclean with any of the swarming things that swarm or crawls on the ground. 45‘For I am the LORD who brought you up from the land of Egypt to be your God; therefore you shall be holy, for I am holy.’”\n\n46This is the law regarding the animal and the bird and every living thing that moves in the waters and everything that swarms on the earth, 47to make a distinction between the [ceremonially] unclean and the [ceremonially] clean, and between the animal that may be eaten and the animal that may not be eaten.\n\nLeviticus 12\nLaws Of Motherhood\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel, saying,\n\n‘If a woman conceives and gives birth to a male child, she shall be [ceremonially] unclean for seven days, unclean as during her monthly period. 3‘On the eighth day the flesh of the male child’s foreskin shall be circumcised. 4‘Then she shall remain [intimately separated] thirty-three days to be purified from the blood; she shall not touch any consecrated thing nor enter the [courtyard of the] sanctuary until the days of her purification are over. 5‘But if she gives birth to a female child, then she shall be unclean for two weeks, as during her monthly period, and she shall remain [intimately separated] sixty-six days to be purified from the blood.\n\n6‘When the days of her purification are completed, whether for a son or for a daughter, she shall bring to the priest at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting a one year old lamb as a burnt offering and a young pigeon or a turtledove as a sin offering; 7and he shall offer it before the LORD and make atonement for her, and she shall be cleansed from the flow of her blood. This is the law for her who gives birth to a child, whether a male or a female child. 8‘If she cannot afford a lamb then she shall take two turtledoves or young pigeons, one as a burnt offering, the other as a sin offering; the priest shall make atonement for her, and she will be clean.’”\n\nLeviticus 13\nThe Test For Leprosy\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses and to Aaron, saying, 2“When a man has a swelling on the skin of his body, a scab, or a bright spot, and it becomes the infection of leprosy on the skin of his body, then he shall be brought to Aaron the priest, or to one of his sons the priests. 3The priest shall look at the diseased spot on the skin of his body, and if the hair in the infection has turned white and the infection appears deeper than the skin of his body, it is an infection of leprosy; when the priest has looked at him, he shall pronounce him [ceremonially] unclean. 4If the bright spot is white on the skin of his body and does not appear to be deeper than the skin, and the hair on it has not turned white, the priest shall isolate the person who has the infection for seven days. 5The priest shall examine it on the seventh day, and if in his estimation the infection has not changed and has not spread on the skin, then the priest shall isolate him for seven more days. 6The priest shall examine him again on the seventh day, and if the infection has a more normal color and the spot has not spread on the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; it is only a scab; and he shall wash his clothes and be clean.\n\n7“But if the scab spreads farther on the skin after he has shown himself to the priest for his [ceremonial] cleansing, he shall show himself to the priest again. 8The priest shall look, and if the scab has spread on the skin, then he shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy.\n\n9“When a leprous infection is on a person, he shall be brought to the priest. 10The priest shall examine him, and if there is a white swelling on the skin and it has turned the hair white and there is new raw flesh in the swelling, 11it is a chronic leprosy on the skin of his body, and the priest shall pronounce him unclean; he shall not isolate him because he is [clearly] unclean. 12But if the [suspected] leprosy breaks out farther on the skin, and it covers all of the skin of the one who has the outbreak—from his head to his foot—wherever the priest looks, 13the priest shall examine him. If the [suspected] leprosy has covered his entire body, he shall pronounce him clean of the disease; it has all turned white, and he is clean. 14But whenever raw flesh appears on him, he shall be unclean. 15The priest shall examine the raw flesh, and he shall pronounce him unclean; the raw flesh is unclean, it is leprosy. 16But if the raw flesh turns again and is changed to white, then he shall come to the priest, 17and the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased part is changed to white, then the priest shall pronounce him who had the disease to be clean; he is clean.\n\n18“And when there is on the skin of the body [the scar of] a boil that is healed, 19and in the place of the boil there is a white swelling or a bright spot, reddish white, then it shall be shown to the priest; 20and the priest shall look, and if it looks deeper than the skin and the hair on it has turned white, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy; it has broken out in the boil. 21But if the priest examines it and finds no white hair in it and it is not deeper than the skin and is dull in color, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days. 22If it spreads farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a disease. 23But if the bright spot remains where it is and does not spread, it is the scar of the boil, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n24“Or if the body has on its skin a burn from fire and the new flesh of the burn becomes a bright spot, reddish white or white, 25then the priest shall examine it, and if the hair in the bright spot has turned white, and it appears deeper than the skin, then leprosy has broken out in the burn. So the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is the disease of leprosy. 26But if the priest examines it and there is no white hair in the bright spot and it is not deeper than [the rest of] the skin but is dull in color, then the priest shall isolate him for seven days. 27And the priest shall examine him on the seventh day; if it is spreading farther on the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is leprosy. 28But if the bright spot remains in its place and has not spread in the skin, but is dull in color, it is a swelling from the burn, and the priest shall pronounce him clean; for it is the scar of the burn.\n\n29“When a man or woman has a disease on the head or in the beard (face), 30the priest shall examine the diseased place; if it appears to be deeper than the skin, with yellow, thin hair in it, the priest shall pronounce him unclean; it is a scale, it is leprosy of the head or beard. 31But if the priest examines the spot infected by the scale, and it does not appear deeper than the skin and there is no black hair in it, the priest shall isolate the person with the scaly infection for seven days. 32On the seventh day the priest shall examine the diseased spot; if the scale has not spread and has no yellow hair in it, and the scale does not look deeper than the skin, 33then he shall shave himself, but he shall not shave the scale; and the priest shall isolate the person with the scale for seven more days. 34Then on the seventh day the priest shall look at the scale; if the scale has not spread on the skin and appears to be no deeper than the skin, the priest shall pronounce him clean; he shall wash his clothes and be clean. 35But if the scale spreads farther on the skin after his cleansing, 36then the priest shall examine him, and if the scale has spread on the skin, the priest need not look for the yellowish hair; he is unclean. 37If, in the priest’s estimation, the scale has remained [without spreading], and black hair has grown in it, the scale is healed; he is clean, and the priest shall pronounce him clean.\n\n38“When a man or a woman has bright spots on the skin of the body, even white bright spots, 39then the priest shall look, and if the bright spots on the skin of their bodies is a dull white, it is [only] a rash that has broken out on the skin; he is clean.\n\n40“If a man loses the hair on his head, he is bald, but he is clean. 41And if he loses the hair on front of his head, he is bald on the forehead, but he is clean. 42But if there is a reddish-white infection on the bald head or forehead, it is leprosy breaking out on his bald head or forehead. 43Then the priest shall examine him, and if the diseased swelling is reddish-white on his bald head or forehead like the appearance of leprosy on the skin of the body, 44he is a leprous man; he is unclean; the priest shall most certainly pronounce him unclean; his disease is on his head.\n\n45“As for the leper who has the infection, his clothes shall be torn, and the hair of his head shall be uncovered (disheveled), and he shall cover his mustache and call out, ‘Unclean! Unclean!’ 46He shall remain [ceremonially] unclean as long as the disease is on him; he is unclean. He shall live alone; he shall live outside the camp.\n\n47“When a garment has a mark of leprosy in it, whether it is a wool garment or a linen garment, 48whether in woven or knitted material or in the warp (lengthwise strands) or woof (crosswise strands) of linen or of wool, or in a skin or on anything made of leather, 49if the mark is greenish or reddish in the garment or in the leather or in the warp or woof or in any article made of leather, it is an infestation of leprosy and shall be shown to the priest. 50The priest shall examine the mark and shall quarantine the article with the mark for seven days. 51He shall examine the mark on the seventh day; if it has spread in the garment, whether in the warp or the woof, or in the leather, whatever the leather’s purpose, the mark is a malignant leprosy; it is unclean. 52So he shall burn the garment, whether the warp or woof, in wool or linen, or on anything made of leather in which the mark occurs; for it is a malignant leprosy; it shall be burned in the fire.\n\n53“But if the priest sees that the mark has not spread in the garment, either in the warp or the woof, or on anything made of leather, 54then the priest shall order that they wash the thing in which the mark occurs, and he shall quarantine it for seven more days. 55The priest shall examine the article with the mark after it has been washed, and if the mark has not changed color, even though the mark has not spread, it is unclean; you shall burn it in the fire; it is a corroding mildew, whether on the top or on the front of it.\n\n56“If the priest looks and the mark has faded after it is washed, he shall tear it out of the garment, or the leather, or out of the warp or woof. 57If it still appears in the garment, either in the warp or in the woof, or on anything made of leather, it is an outbreak; you shall burn the marked part in the fire. 58“The garment, whether the warp or the woof, or anything made of leather from which the mildew has departed after washing, shall then be washed a second time and it will be [ceremonially] clean.”\n\n59This is the law for a leprous disease in a garment of wool or linen, either in the warp or woof, or on anything made of leather, to pronounce it clean or unclean.\n\nLeviticus 14\nLaw Of Cleansing A Leper\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“This shall be the law of the leper on the day of his [ceremonial] cleansing. He shall be brought to the priest [at a meeting place outside the camp]; 3the priest shall go out of the camp [to meet him]; and the priest shall examine him, and if the leper has been healed of the infection of leprosy, 4then the priest shall give orders to take two live clean birds and cedar wood and scarlet string and hyssop for the one to be cleansed. 5Next the priest shall order that one of the birds be killed [as a sacrifice] in an earthenware container over [fresh] running water. 6As for the live bird, he shall take it together with the cedar wood and the scarlet string and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the live bird in the blood of the bird sacrificed over the running water. 7He shall sprinkle [the blood] seven times on the one to be cleansed from the leprosy and shall pronounce him [ceremonially] clean. Then he shall let the live bird go free over the open field. 8The one to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, shave off all his hair, and bathe in water; and he shall be clean. After that he may come into the camp, but he shall stay outside of his tent for seven days. 9On the seventh day he shall shave off all his hair: he shall shave his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair [on his body]. Then he shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and be clean.\n\n10“Now on the eighth day he shall take two male lambs without blemish, and a yearling ewe lamb without blemish, and three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with [olive] oil as a grain offering, and one log (about a pint) of oil; 11and the priest who cleanses him shall present the man to be cleansed and his offerings before the LORD at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 12Then the priest shall take one of the male lambs and offer it as a guilt offering, with the log of oil, and present them as a wave offering before the LORD. 13He shall kill the male lamb in the place where they kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the sacred place [the courtyard of the tabernacle]; for the guilt offering, like the sin offering, belongs to the priest; it is most holy. 14The priest shall take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 15The priest shall also take some of the log of oil, and pour it into the palm of his own left hand; 16and the priest shall dip his right finger in the oil that is in his left palm, and with his finger sprinkle some of the oil seven times before the LORD. 17Of the rest of the oil which is in his palm, the priest shall put some on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on top of the blood of the guilt offering. 18The remaining oil that is in the priest’s palm shall be put on the head of the one to be cleansed. The priest shall make atonement for him before the LORD. 19Next the priest shall offer the sin offering and make atonement for the one to be cleansed from his uncleanness, and afterward kill the burnt offering. 20The priest shall offer the burnt offering and the grain offering on the altar; and the priest shall make atonement for him, and he shall be clean.\n\n21“But if the cleansed leper is poor and his means are insufficient, then he is to take one lamb as a guilt offering to be waved to make atonement for him, and one tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and a log of oil, 22and two turtledoves or two young pigeons, such as he can afford, one shall be a sin offering, the other a burnt offering. 23He shall bring them on the eighth day for his [ceremonial] cleansing to the priest at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, before the LORD. 24The priest shall take the lamb of the guilt offering, and the log of oil, and shall present them as a wave offering before the LORD. 25Next he shall kill the lamb of the guilt offering; and the priest is to take some of the blood of the guilt offering and put it on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot. 26The priest shall pour some of the oil into his left palm, 27and with his right finger the priest shall sprinkle some of the oil that is in his left palm seven times before the LORD. 28The priest shall put some of the oil in his palm on the lobe of the right ear of the one to be cleansed, and on the thumb of his right hand, and on the big toe of his right foot, on the places where he has put the blood of the guilt offering. 29The rest of the oil that is in the priest’s palm shall be put on the head of the one to be cleansed, to make atonement for him before the LORD. 30Then he shall offer one of the turtledoves or young pigeons, which are within his means. 31He shall offer what he can afford, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering, together with the grain offering. The priest shall make atonement before the LORD on behalf of the one to be cleansed. 32“This is the law for the one in whom there is an infection of leprosy, whose means are limited for his [ceremonial] cleansing.”\n\nCleansing an Infected House 33The LORD further spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying,\n\n34“When you come into the land of Canaan, which I am giving you as a possession, and I put a mark of leprosy on a house in your land, 35then the one who owns the house shall come and tell the priest, ‘I have seen something that looks like a mark of leprosy in my house.’ 36The priest shall order that they empty the house before he goes in to examine the mark, so that everything in the house will not have to be declared unclean; afterward he shall go in to see the house. 37He shall examine the mark, and if the mark on the walls of the house has greenish or reddish depressions and appears deeper than the surface, 38the priest shall go out of the house, to the doorway, and quarantine the house for seven days. 39The priest shall return on the seventh day and look; and if the mark has spread on the walls of the house, 40he shall order them to tear out the contaminated stones and throw them into an unclean place outside the city. 41He shall have the entire inside area of the house scraped, and the plaster that is scraped off shall be dumped in an unclean place outside the city. 42Then they shall take new stones and replace the [contaminated] stones, and he shall take plaster and replaster the house.\n\n43“If, however, the mark breaks out again in the house after he has removed the stones and has scraped and replastered the house, 44then the priest shall come and look again, and if the mark has spread in the house, it is a malignant leprosy in the house; it is [ceremonially] unclean. 45He shall tear down the house—its stones and its timber and all the plaster of the house—and shall take everything outside the city to an unclean place. 46Moreover, whoever goes into the house during the time that it is quarantined becomes unclean until evening. 47And whoever lies down in the house [to rest] shall wash his clothes, and whoever eats in the house shall wash his clothes.\n\n48“But if the priest comes in and inspects it and the mark has not spread in the house after the house has been replastered, he shall pronounce the house clean because the mark has not reappeared. 49To cleanse the house then, he shall take two birds and cedar wood and scarlet string and hyssop; 50and he shall kill one of the birds in an earthenware container over running water, 51and he shall take the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string, and the living bird, and dip them in the blood of the slain bird as well as in the running water, and sprinkle the house seven times. 52So he shall cleanse the house with the blood of the bird and with the running water, along with the live bird and the cedar wood and the hyssop and the scarlet string. 53“But he shall let the live bird go free outside the city into the open field. So he shall make atonement for the house, and it will be clean.”\n\n54This is the law for any mark of leprosy—even for a scale, 55and for the leprous garment or house, 56and for a swelling, and for a scab, and for a bright spot on the skin— 57to teach when they are unclean and when they are clean. This is the law of leprosy [in regard to both persons and property].\n\nLeviticus 15\nCleansing Unhealthiness\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘When any man has a bodily discharge, his discharge is unclean. 3‘This shall be [the law concerning] his uncleanness in his discharge: whether his body allows its discharge to flow or obstructs its flow; it is uncleanness in him. 4‘Every bed on which the one who has the discharge lies becomes unclean, and everything on which he sits becomes unclean. 5‘Whoever touches his bed shall wash his clothes, and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening; 6and whoever sits on anything on which the man with the discharge has been sitting shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 7‘Also whoever touches the man with the discharge shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 8‘And if he who has the discharge spits on one who is clean, then he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 9‘Any saddle on which the man with the discharge rides becomes unclean. 10‘Whoever touches anything that has been under him shall be unclean until evening; and whoever carries those things shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 11‘Whomever the one with the discharge touches without rinsing his hands in water shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 12‘An earthenware container that the one with the discharge touches shall be broken, and every wooden container shall be rinsed in water.\n\n13‘When the man with the discharge becomes cleansed from his discharge, he shall count off seven days for his purification; he shall then wash his clothes and bathe his body in running water and will become clean. 14‘On the eighth day he shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons and come before the LORD to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, and give them to the priest; 15and the priest shall offer them, one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering. So the priest shall make atonement for the man before the LORD because of his discharge.\n\n16‘Now if any man has a seminal emission, he shall wash all his body in water, and be unclean until evening. 17‘Every garment and every leather on which there is semen shall be washed with water, and shall be unclean until evening. 18‘If a man lies with a woman so that there is a seminal emission, they shall both bathe in water and be unclean until evening.\n\n19‘When a woman has a discharge, if her bodily discharge is blood, she shall continue in her menstrual impurity for seven days; and whoever touches her shall be unclean until evening. 20‘Everything on which she lies during her menstrual impurity shall be unclean; and everything on which she sits shall be unclean. 21‘Anyone who touches her bed shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 22‘Whoever touches anything on which she sits shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 23‘And if it is on her bed or on the thing on which she is sitting, when he touches it, he shall be unclean until evening. 24‘If a man actually lies with her so that her menstrual impurity is on him, he shall be unclean for seven days; and every bed on which he lies shall be unclean.\n\n25‘Now if a woman has a flow of blood for many days, not during the time of her menstruation, or if she has a discharge beyond that period, as long as the impure discharge continues she shall be as she is in the days of her [normal] menstrual impurity; she is unclean. 26‘Every bed on which she lies during the time of her discharge shall be to her like the bed of her menstrual impurity, and whatever she sits on shall be unclean, like the uncleanness of her monthly period. 27‘And whoever touches those things shall be unclean, and shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be unclean until evening. 28‘When she is cleansed from her discharge, then she shall count off for herself seven days, and after that she will be clean. 29‘Then on the eighth day she shall take for herself two turtledoves or two young pigeons and bring them to the priest at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting; 30and the priest shall offer one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering; and he shall make atonement for her before the LORD for her unclean discharge.’\n\n31“Thus you shall separate the Israelites from their uncleanness, so that they do not die in their uncleanness by their defiling My tabernacle that is among them.” 32This is the law for the one who has a discharge and for the one who has a seminal emission, so that he is unclean by it; 33and for the woman who is ill because of her monthly period, and for the one who has a discharge, whether man or woman, or for a man who lies with a woman who is [ceremonially] unclean.\n\nLeviticus 16\nLaw Of Atonement\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses after the death of the two sons of Aaron who had died when they [irreverently] approached the presence of the LORD. 2The LORD said to Moses,\n\n“Tell Aaron your brother that he must not enter at any time into the Holy Place inside the veil (the Holy of Holies), before the mercy seat which is on the ark, or he will die, for I will appear in the cloud over the mercy seat. 3Aaron [as high priest] shall enter the Holy Place in this way: with [the blood of] a young bull as a sin offering and [the blood of] a ram as a burnt offering. 4He shall put on the holy linen tunic, and the linen undergarments shall be next to his body, and he shall be belted with the linen sash, and dressed with the linen turban (these are the holy garments). He shall bathe his body in water and put them on. 5He shall take from the congregation of the Israelites [at their expense] two male goats as a sin offering and one ram as a burnt offering. 6Then Aaron shall present the bull as the sin offering for himself, and make atonement for himself and for his house. 7He shall take the two goats and present them before the LORD at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. 8Aaron shall cast lots for the two goats—one lot for the LORD, the other lot for the scapegoat. 9Then Aaron shall bring the goat on which the LORD’S lot fell and offer it as a sin offering. 10But the goat on which the lot fell for the scapegoat shall be presented alive before the LORD to make atonement on it; it shall be sent into the wilderness as the scapegoat.\n\n11“Aaron shall present the bull as the sin offering for himself and make atonement for himself and for his household (the other priests), and he shall kill the bull as the sin offering for himself. 12He shall take a censer full of burning coals from the [bronze] altar before the LORD, and two handfuls of finely ground sweet incense, and bring it inside the veil [into the Most Holy Place], 13and put the incense on the fire [in the censer] before the LORD, so that the cloud of the incense may cover the mercy seat that is on [the ark of] the Testimony, otherwise he will die. 14He shall take some of the bull’s blood and sprinkle it with his finger on the east side of the mercy seat; also in front of the mercy seat he shall sprinkle some of the blood with his finger seven times.\n\n15“Then he shall kill the goat of the sin offering that is for [the sins of] the people and bring its blood within the veil [into the Most Holy Place] and do with its blood as he did with the blood of the bull, and sprinkle it on the mercy seat and in front of the mercy seat. 16So he shall make atonement for the Holy Place (Holy of Holies) because of the uncleanness and transgressions of the Israelites, for all their sins. He shall also do this for the Tent of Meeting which is among them in the midst of their uncleanness (impurities). 17There shall be no person in the Tent of Meeting when the high priest goes in to make atonement in the Holy Place [within the veil] until he comes out, so that he may make atonement for himself (his own sins) and for his household and for all the congregation of Israel. 18Then he shall go out to the altar [of burnt offering in the court] which is before the LORD and make atonement for it, and shall take some of the blood of the bull and of the goat and put it on the horns of the altar on all sides. 19With his finger he shall sprinkle some of the blood on the altar of burnt offering seven times and cleanse it and consecrate it from the uncleanness of the Israelites.\n\n20“When he has finished atoning for the Holy Place and the Tent of Meeting and the altar, he shall present the live goat. 21Then Aaron shall lay both of his hands on the head of the live goat, and confess over it all the wickedness of the sons of Israel and all their transgressions in regard to all their sins; and he shall lay them on the head of the goat [the scapegoat, the sin-bearer], and send it away into the wilderness by the hand of a man who is prepared [for the task]. 22The goat shall carry on itself all their (the Israelites) wickedness, carrying them to a solitary (infertile) land; and he shall release the goat in the wilderness.\n\n23“Then Aaron shall come into the Tent of Meeting and take off the linen garments which he put on when he went into the Holy Place (Holy of Holies), and shall leave them there. 24He shall bathe his body with water in a holy place and put on his clothes, and come out and offer his burnt offering and that of the people, and make atonement for himself and for the people. 25And he shall offer up in smoke the fat of the sin offering on the altar. 26The man who released the goat as the [sin-bearing] scapegoat shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and afterward he may come into the camp. 27The bull for the sin offering and the goat for the sin offering, whose blood was brought in to make atonement in the Holy Place (Holy of Holies), shall be taken outside the camp; their skins, their meat, and their waste shall be burned in the fire. 28Then he who burns them shall wash his clothes and bathe his body with water, and afterward he may come into the camp.\n\nAn Annual Atonement 29“This shall be a permanent statute for you: in the seventh month (nearly October) on the tenth day of the month you shall humble yourselves [by fasting] and not do any work, whether the native-born or the stranger who lives temporarily among you; 30for it is on this day that atonement shall be made for you, to cleanse you; you will be clean from all your sins before the LORD. 31It is a Sabbath of solemn rest for you, and you shall humble yourselves; it is a permanent statute. 32So the priest who is anointed and ordained to serve and minister as priest in his father’s place shall make atonement: he shall wear the holy linen garments, 33and make atonement for the Holy Sanctuary, and he shall make atonement for the Tent of Meeting, and for the altar [of burnt offering in the court]. He shall also make atonement for the priests and for all the people of the assembly. 34“This shall be a permanent statute for you, so that atonement may be made for the children of Israel for all their sins once a year.” So he did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\nLeviticus 17\nBlood For Atonement\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to Aaron and his sons and all the children of Israel, and say to them, ‘This is what the LORD has commanded, saying, 3“Any man from the house of Israel who kills an ox or lamb or goat in the camp, or kills it outside the camp 4and has not brought it to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting to offer it as an offering to the LORD before the tabernacle of the LORD, that man shall be guilty of bloodshed. He has shed blood and shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 5This is so that the sons of Israel may bring their sacrifices which they were sacrificing [to idols] in the open field [where they killed them], that they may bring them in to the LORD, at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting to the priest, and sacrifice them as sacrifices of peace offerings to the LORD. 6The priest shall sprinkle the blood on the altar of the LORD at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting and offer the fat up in smoke as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 7“So they shall no longer offer their sacrifices to goat-idols or demons or field spirits with which they have played the prostitute. This shall be a permanent statute for them throughout their generations.”’\n\n8“Then you shall say to them, ‘Any man from the house of Israel or any of the strangers living temporarily among you, who offers a burnt offering or sacrifice 9and does not bring it to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting to offer it to the LORD shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them].\n\n10‘Any man from the house of Israel, or any stranger living temporarily among you, who eats any blood, against that person I shall set My face and I will cut him off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 11‘For the life of the flesh is in the blood, and I have given it to you on the altar to make atonement for your souls; for it is the blood that makes atonement, by reason of the life [which it represents].’ 12Therefore I have said to the sons of Israel, ‘No person among you may eat blood, nor may any stranger living temporarily among you eat blood.’ 13So when any Israelite or any stranger living temporarily among them, catches any ceremonially clean animal or bird when hunting, he shall pour out its blood and cover it with earth.\n\n14“For in regard to the life of all flesh, its blood is [the same] as its life; therefore I said to the Israelites, ‘You are not to eat the blood of any flesh, for the life of all flesh is its blood. Whoever eats it shall be cut off [excluding him from the atonement made for them].’ 15Every person who eats an animal which dies [of natural causes] or was torn by a predator, whether he is native-born or a stranger, he shall wash his clothes and bathe in water, and be [ceremonially] unclean until evening; then he will become clean. 16“But if he does not wash his clothes or bathe his body, he shall bear his guilt [for it will not be borne by the sacrifice of atonement].”\n\nLeviticus 18\nLaws On Immoral Relations\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘I am the LORD your God. 3‘You shall not do what is done in the land of Egypt where you lived, and you shall not do what is done in the land of Canaan where I am bringing you. You shall not follow their statutes (practices, customs). 4‘You are to follow My judgments (precepts, ordinances) and keep My statutes and live by them. I am the LORD your God. 5‘So you shall keep My statutes and My judgments, by which, if a person keeps them, he shall live; I am the LORD.\n\n6‘No one shall approach any blood relative of his to uncover nakedness (have intimate relations). I am the LORD. 7‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father, that is, the nakedness of your mother. She is your mother. You shall not uncover her nakedness. 8‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife; it is your father’s nakedness. 9‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your sister, either the daughter of your father or of your mother, whether born at home or born elsewhere. 10‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your son’s daughter or your daughter’s daughter; their nakedness you shall not uncover, for they are your own nakedness [that is, your own descendants]. 11‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s wife’s daughter; born to your father, she is your sister. 12‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s sister; she is your father’s blood relative. 13‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your mother’s sister, for she is your mother’s blood relative. 14‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your father’s brother’s wife; you shall not approach his wife; she is your aunt. 15‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your daughter-in-law; she is your son’s wife. You shall not uncover her nakedness. 16‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of your brother’s wife; it is your brother’s nakedness. 17‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of a woman and her daughter, nor shall you take her son’s daughter or her daughter’s daughter to uncover their nakedness (have intimate relations with them); they are [her] blood relatives; it is an outrageous offense. 18‘You shall not marry a woman in addition to her sister as a rival while she is alive, to uncover her nakedness.\n\n19‘Also you shall not approach a woman to uncover her nakedness during her menstrual impurity and ceremonial uncleanness. 20‘You shall not have intimate relations with your neighbor’s wife, to be defiled with her. 21‘You shall not give any of your children to offer them [by fire as a sacrifice] to Molech [the god of the Ammonites], nor shall you profane the name of your God [by honoring idols as gods]. I am the LORD. 22‘You shall not lie [intimately] with a male as one lies with a female; it is repulsive. 23‘You shall not have intimate relations with any animal to be defiled with it; nor shall a woman stand before an animal to mate with it; it is a perversion.\n\n24‘Do not defile yourselves by any of these things; for by all these the nations which I am casting out before you have become defiled. 25‘For the land has become defiled; therefore I have brought its punishment upon it, and the land vomits out its inhabitants. 26‘But as for you, you are to keep My statutes and My judgments (precepts) and shall not commit any of these repulsive acts, neither the native-born, nor the stranger who lives temporarily among you 27(for all these repulsive acts have been done by the men who lived in the land before you, and the land has become defiled); 28[do none of these things] so that the land will not vomit you out, should you defile it, as it has vomited out the nation which has been before you. 29‘For whoever commits any of these repulsive acts, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their people [excluding them from the atonement made for them]. 30‘So keep My command: do not practice any of the repulsive customs which have been practiced before you, so as not to defile yourselves by them; I am the LORD your God.’”\n\nLeviticus 19\nIdolatry Forbidden\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying,\n\n2“Say to all the congregation of the children of Israel, ‘You shall be holy, for I the LORD your God am holy. 3‘Each of you shall respect his mother and his father, and you shall keep My Sabbaths; I am the LORD your God. 4‘Do not turn to idols or make for yourselves molten gods (images cast in metal); I am the LORD your God.\n\n5‘Now when you offer a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, you shall offer it so that you may be accepted. 6‘It shall be eaten the same day you offer it and on the day following; and if anything remains until the third day, it shall be burned in the fire. 7‘But if it is eaten at all on the third day, it is repulsive; it will not be accepted [by God as an offering]. 8‘Everyone who eats it will bear [the responsibility for] his wickedness, for he has profaned a holy thing of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them].\n\nVarious Laws 9‘Now when you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the very corners of your field, nor shall you gather the gleanings (grain left after reaping) of your harvest. 10‘And you shall not glean your vineyard, nor shall you gather its fallen grapes; you shall leave them for the poor and for the stranger. I am the LORD your God.\n\n11‘You shall not steal, nor deal deceptively, nor lie to one another. 12‘You shall not swear [an oath] falsely by My name, so as to profane the name of your God; I am the LORD.\n\n13‘You shall not oppress or exploit your neighbor, nor rob him. You shall not withhold the wages of a hired man overnight until morning. 14‘You shall not curse a deaf man nor put a stumbling block before the blind, but you shall fear your God [with profound reverence]; I am the LORD.\n\n15‘You shall not do injustice in judgment; you shall not be partial to the poor nor show a preference for the great, but judge your neighbor fairly. 16‘You shall not go around as a gossip among your people, and you are not to act against the life of your neighbor [with slander or false testimony]; I am the LORD.\n\n17‘You shall not hate your brother in your heart; you may most certainly rebuke your neighbor, but shall not incur sin because of him. 18‘You shall not take revenge nor bear any grudge against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor (acquaintance, associate, companion) as yourself; I am the LORD.\n\n19‘You are to keep My statutes. You shall not breed together two kinds of your cattle; you shall not sow your field with two kinds of seed, nor wear clothing of two kinds of material mixed together.\n\n20‘Now if a man has intimate relations with a woman who is a slave acquired for [marriage to] another man, but who has not been redeemed nor given her freedom, there shall be punishment [after an investigation]; they shall not be put to death, because she was not free; 21but he shall bring his guilt offering to the LORD to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, a ram as a guilt offering. 22‘The priest shall make atonement for him with the ram of the guilt offering before the LORD for his sin which he has committed; and he shall be forgiven for his sin.\n\n23‘When you enter the land and plant all kinds of trees for food, then you shall consider their fruit forbidden. For three years the fruit shall be forbidden to you; it shall not be eaten. 24‘In the fourth year all the fruit shall be holy, an offering of praise to the LORD. 25‘In the fifth year you may eat the fruit [of the trees], this is so that their yield may increase for you; I am the LORD your God.\n\n26‘You shall not eat anything with the blood, nor practice divination [using omens or witchcraft] or soothsaying. 27‘You shall not trim and round off the side-growth of [the hair on] your heads, nor mar the edges of your beard. 28‘You shall not make any cuts on your body [in mourning] for the dead, nor make any tattoo marks on yourselves; I am the LORD.\n\n29‘Do not profane your daughter by making her a prostitute, so that the land will not fall to prostitution and become full of wickedness. 30‘You shall keep My Sabbaths and revere My sanctuary. I am the LORD.\n\n31‘Do not turn to mediums [who pretend to consult the dead] or to spiritists [who have spirits of divination]; do not seek them out to be defiled by them.

I am the LORD.’”\n\nLeviticus 20\nOn Human Sacrifice And Immoralities\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Moreover, you shall say to the children of Israel,\n\n‘Any Israelite or any stranger residing in Israel who gives any of his children to Molech (the god of the Ammonites) [as a human sacrifice] shall most certainly be put to death; the people of the land shall stone him with stones. 3‘I will also set My face against that man [opposing him, withdrawing My protection from him] and will cut him off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them], because he has given some of his children to Molech, so as to defile My sanctuary and profane My holy name. 4‘If the people of the land should ever tolerate that man when he gives any of his children [as a burnt offering] to Molech, and fail to put him to death [as My law requires], 5then I shall set My face against that man and against his [extended] family, and I will cut off from their people both him and all who follow him in playing the prostitute (commit apostasy) with Molech.\n\n6‘As for the person who turns to mediums [who consult the dead] or to spiritists, to play the prostitute after them, I shall set My face against that person and will cut him off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 7‘You shall consecrate yourselves therefore, and be holy; for I am the LORD your God. 8‘You shall keep My statutes and do them. I am the LORD who sanctifies you.\n\n9‘If anyone curses his father or mother, he shall most certainly be put to death; he has cursed his father or mother; his blood is on him [that is, he bears full responsibility for the consequences].\n\n10‘The man who commits adultery with another’s wife, even his neighbor’s wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall most certainly be put to death. 11‘The man who lies [intimately] with his father’s wife has uncovered his father’s nakedness; both of them shall most certainly be put to death; their blood is on them. 12‘If a man lies [intimately] with his daughter-in-law, both of them shall most certainly be put to death; they have committed incest; their blood is on them. 13‘If a man lies [intimately] with a male as if he were a woman, both men have committed a detestable (perverse, unnatural) act; they shall most certainly be put to death; their blood is on them. 14‘It is immoral and shameful if a man marries a woman and her mother; all three shall be burned in fire, so that there will be no immorality among you. 15‘If a man has intimate relations with an animal, he shall most certainly be put to death; you shall kill the animal also. 16‘If a woman approaches any animal to mate with it, you shall kill the woman and the animal; they shall most certainly be put to death; their blood is on them.\n\n17‘If a man takes his sister, his father’s daughter or his mother’s daughter, so that he sees her nakedness and she sees his nakedness, it is a disgrace; and they shall be cut off in the sight of the sons of their people. He has uncovered his sister’s nakedness; he bears [responsibility for] his guilt. 18‘If a man lies [intimately] with a woman during her menstrual cycle and uncovers her nakedness, he has exposed her flow, and she has uncovered the flow of her blood; both of them shall be cut off from their people [excluding them from the atonement made for them]. 19‘You shall not uncover the nakedness of (have intimate relations with) your mother’s sister or your father’s sister, for such a one has uncovered his blood relative; they will bear their guilt. 20‘If there is a man who lies [intimately] with his uncle’s wife, he has uncovered his uncle’s nakedness; they will bear their sin. They will die childless. 21‘If a man takes his brother’s wife, it is a hated and unclean thing; he has uncovered his brother’s nakedness. They will be childless.\n\n22‘Therefore keep all My statutes and all My ordinances and do them, so that the land where I am bringing you to live may not vomit you out [as it did those before you]. 23‘You shall not follow the statutes (laws, practices, customs) of the nation which I am driving out before you; for they did all these things, and therefore I have loathed them. 24‘But I have said to you, “You are to inherit and take possession of their land, and I will give it to you to possess, a land [of plenty] flowing with milk and honey.” I am the LORD your God, who has separated you from the peoples (pagan nations). 25‘You are therefore to make a distinction between the [ceremonially] clean animal and the unclean, and between the unclean bird and the clean; and you shall not make yourselves detestable by animal or by bird or by anything that crawls on the ground, which I have set apart from you as unclean. 26‘You are to be holy to Me; for I the LORD am holy, and have set you apart from the peoples (nations) to be Mine.\n\n27‘A man or woman who is a medium [who pretends to consult the dead] or who is a spiritist shall most certainly be put to death, and be stoned with stones; their blood is on them.’”\n\nLeviticus 21\nRegulations Concerning Priests\n\n1Then the LORD said to Moses, “Speak to the priests, the sons of Aaron, and say to them:\n\n‘No one shall defile himself [that is, become ceremonially unclean] for the dead among his people [by touching a corpse or assisting in preparing it for burial], 2except for his relatives who are nearest to him, his mother, his father, his son, his daughter, and his brother, 3also his virgin sister, who is near to him because she has had no husband; for her he may become unclean. 4‘He shall not become unclean as a relative by marriage among his people, and so profane himself. 5‘The priests shall not shave their heads, nor shave off the edges of their beards, nor make any cuts in their body. 6‘They shall be holy to their God and not profane the name of their God; for they present the offerings by fire to the LORD, the food of their God; so they shall be holy. 7‘They shall not take [as a wife] a woman who is a prostitute, nor a woman who is divorced from her husband; for the priest is holy to his God. 8‘You shall consecrate him, therefore, for he offers the food of your God; he shall be holy to you; for I the LORD, who sanctifies you, am holy. 9‘The daughter of any priest who profanes herself by prostitution profanes her father; she shall be burned in fire.\n\n10‘But he who is the high priest among his brothers, on whose head the anointing oil has been poured and who has been consecrated to wear the [sacred] garments, shall not uncover his head nor tear his clothes [in mourning], 11nor shall he approach any dead person, nor defile himself [by doing so, even] for his father or for his mother; 12nor shall he go out of the sanctuary nor profane (make ceremonially unclean) the sanctuary of his God, for the consecration of the anointing oil of his God is on him; I am the LORD. 13‘He shall take a wife in her virginity. 14‘He may not marry a widow or a divorced woman or one who is profaned by prostitution, but he is to marry a virgin from his own people, 15so that he will not profane or dishonor his children among his people; for I am the LORD who sanctifies the high priest.’”\n\n16Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 17“Say to Aaron, ‘Throughout their generations none of your descendants who has any [physical] defect shall approach [the altar] to present the food of his God. 18‘For no man who has a defect shall approach [God’s altar as a priest]: no man who is blind or lame, or who has a disfigured face, or any deformed limb, 19or a man who has a broken foot or a broken hand, 20or a hunchback or a dwarf, or one who has a defect in his eye or eczema or scabs or crushed testicles. 21‘No man among the descendants of Aaron the priest who has a [physical] defect and is disfigured or deformed is to approach [the altar] to present the offerings of the LORD by fire. He has a defect; he shall not approach [the altar] to present the food of his God. 22‘He may eat the food of his God, both of the most holy and of the holy things, 23but he shall not go within the veil or approach the altar [of incense], because he has a defect, so that he will not profane My sanctuaries; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’” 24So Moses spoke to Aaron and to his sons, and to all the Israelites.\n\nLeviticus 22\nVarious Rules For Priests\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Tell Aaron and his sons to be careful with the holy things (offerings, gifts) which the children of Israel dedicate to Me, so that they do not profane My holy name; I am the LORD. 3Say to them, ‘Any one of your descendants throughout your generations who approaches the holy things which the Israelites dedicate to the LORD, while he is [ceremonially] unclean, that person shall be cut off from My presence and excluded from the sanctuary; I am the LORD. 4‘No man of the descendants of Aaron who is a leper or has a discharge may eat the holy things [the offerings and the showbread] until he is clean. And whoever touches any person or thing made unclean by contact with a corpse or a man who has had a seminal emission, 5or whoever touches any crawling thing by which he is made unclean, or any person by whom he is made unclean, whatever it may be, 6the person who touches any such thing shall be unclean until evening and shall not eat the holy things unless he has bathed his body in water. 7‘When the sun sets, he will be clean, and afterward he may eat the holy things, for it is his food. 8‘He shall not eat that which dies [of natural causes] or is torn by a predator, becoming unclean by it; I am the LORD. 9‘Therefore the priests shall observe My ordinance, so that they will not bear sin because of it and die if they profane it; I am the LORD who sanctifies them.\n\n10‘No layman [that is, someone outside of Aaron’s family] is to eat the holy gift [which has been offered to God]; a foreigner residing with the priest or a hired man shall not eat the holy thing. 11‘But if a priest buys a slave as his property with his money, the slave may eat the holy thing, and those who are born in the priest’s house; they may eat his food. 12‘If a priest’s daughter is married to a layman [one not part of the priestly tribe], she shall not eat the offering of the holy things. 13‘But if a priest’s daughter is a widow or divorced, and has no child, and returns to her father’s house as in her youth, she shall eat her father’s food; but no layman shall eat it. 14‘But if a person unknowingly eats a holy gift [which has been offered to God], then he shall add one-fifth of its value to it and give the holy gift to the priest. 15‘The priests shall not profane the holy things the Israelites offer to the LORD, 16and so cause them [by neglect of any essential observance] to bear the punishment of guilt when they eat their holy things; for I am the LORD who sanctifies them.’”\n\nFlawless Animals for Sacrifice 17Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 18“Speak to Aaron and his sons and to all the Israelites and say to them, ‘Any man of the house of Israel or any stranger in Israel who presents his offering, whether to fulfill any of their vows or as any of their freewill (voluntary) offerings which they presented to the LORD as a burnt offering— 19so that you may be accepted—it must be a male without blemish from the cattle, the sheep, or the goats. 20‘You shall not offer anything which has a blemish, because it will not be accepted for you. 21‘Whoever offers a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD to fulfill a special vow to the LORD or as a freewill offering from the herd or from the flock, it must be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish in it. 22‘Animals that are blind or fractured or mutilated, or have a sore or a running wound or an itch or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD nor make an offering of them by fire on the altar to the LORD. 23‘For a freewill offering you may offer either a bull or a lamb which has an overgrown or stunted member (deformity), but for [the payment of] a vow it will not be accepted. 24‘You shall not offer to the LORD any animal which has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut off, or sacrifice it in your land. 25‘Nor shall you offer as the food of your God any such [animals obtained] from a foreigner, because their corruption and blemish makes them unfit; there is a defect in them, they shall not be accepted for you.’”\n\n26Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 27“When a bull or a sheep or a goat is born, it shall remain for seven days with its mother; and after the eighth day it shall be accepted as an offering by fire to the LORD. 28And whether [the mother] is a cow or a sheep, you shall not kill both it and its young in one day. 29When you sacrifice an offering of thanksgiving to the LORD, you shall sacrifice it so that you may be accepted. 30It shall be eaten on the same day; you shall leave none of it until the next morning; I am the LORD. 31So you shall keep My commandments and do them; I am the LORD.\n\n32“You shall not profane My holy name [using it to honor an idol, or treating it with irreverence or contempt or as a byword]; but I will be sanctified (set apart as holy) among the Israelites. I am the LORD, who sanctifies and declares you holy, 33who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God; I am the LORD.”\n\nLeviticus 23\nLaws Of Religious Festivals\n\n1The LORD spoke again to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘The appointed times (established feasts) of the LORD which you shall proclaim as holy convocations—My appointed times are these:\n\nThe Sabbath 3‘For six days work may be done, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of complete rest, a holy convocation (calling together). You shall not do any work [on that day]; it is the Sabbath of the LORD wherever you may be.\n\nThe Passover and Unleavened Bread 4‘These are the appointed times of the LORD, holy convocations which you shall proclaim at their appointed times: 5‘The LORD’S Passover is on the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight. 6‘The Feast of Unleavened Bread to the LORD is on the fifteenth day of the same month; for seven days you shall eat unleavened bread. 7‘On the first day you shall have a holy convocation (calling together); you shall not do any laborious work [on that day]. 8‘But you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD for seven days; on the seventh day there shall be a holy convocation; you shall not do any laborious work [on that day].’”\n\nThe Feast of First Fruits 9Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 10“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘When you enter the land which I am giving you and reap its harvest, you shall bring the sheaf of the first fruits of your harvest to the priest. 11‘He shall wave the sheaf before the LORD so that you may be accepted; the priest shall wave it on the day after the Sabbath. 12‘Now on the day when you wave the sheaf you shall offer a male lamb one year old without blemish as a burnt offering to the LORD. 13‘Its grain offering shall be two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with [olive] oil, an offering by fire to the LORD for a sweet and soothing aroma, with its drink offering [to be poured out], a fourth of a hin of wine. 14‘You shall not eat any bread or roasted grain or new growth, until this same day when you bring in the offering to your God; it is a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you may be.\n\nThe Feast of Weeks 15‘You shall count from the day after the Sabbath, from the day when you brought in the sheaf (tied bundle of grain) of the wave offering; there shall be seven complete Sabbaths (seven full weeks). 16‘You shall count fifty days to the day after the seventh Sabbath; then you shall present a new grain offering to the LORD. 17‘You shall bring in from your places two loaves of bread as a wave offering, made from two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour; they shall be baked with leaven as first fruits to the LORD. 18‘And you shall offer with the bread seven unblemished lambs, one year old, and one young bull and two rams. They are to be a burnt offering to the LORD, with their grain offering and their drink offerings. It is an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 19‘And you shall sacrifice one male goat as a sin offering and two male lambs, one year old as a sacrifice of peace offerings. 20‘The priest shall wave them before the LORD as a wave offering, together with the bread of the first fruits and the two lambs. They are to be holy to the LORD for the priest. 21‘On this same day you shall make a proclamation, you are to have a holy convocation (calling together); you shall not do any laborious work [on that day]. It is to be a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you may be.\n\n22‘When you reap the harvest of your land, you shall not reap to the edges of your field, nor gather the gleaning of your harvest; you are to leave them for the poor and for the stranger. I am the LORD your God.’”\n\nThe Feast of Trumpets 23Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 24“Say to the children of Israel, ‘On the first day of the seventh month (almost October), you shall observe a day of solemn sabbatical rest, a memorial day announced by the blowing of trumpets, a holy convocation. 25‘You shall not do any laborious work [on that day], but you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD.’”\n\nThe Day of Atonement 26The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 27“Also the tenth day of this seventh month is the Day of Atonement; it shall be a holy convocation for you, and you shall humble yourselves [by fasting] and present an offering by fire to the LORD. 28You shall not do any work on this same day, for it is the Day of Atonement, to make atonement on your behalf before the LORD your God. 29If there is any person who will not humble himself on this same day, he shall be cut off from his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 30If there is any person who does any work on this same day, I will destroy that person from among his people. 31You shall do no work at all [on that day]. It is a permanent statute throughout your generations wherever you may be. 32“It is to be to you a Sabbath of complete rest, and you shall humble yourselves. On the ninth day of the month at evening, from evening to evening you shall keep your Sabbath.”\n\nThe Feast of Booths 33Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 34“Say to the children of Israel, ‘On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, and for seven days, is the Feast of Booths (Tabernacles) to the LORD. 35‘The first day is a holy convocation (calling together); you shall not do any laborious work [on that day]. 36‘For seven days you shall present an offering by fire to the LORD. On the eighth day you shall have a holy convocation and present an offering by fire to the LORD. It is a festive assembly; you shall not do any laborious work [on that day].\n\n37‘These are the appointed times (established feasts) of the LORD, which you shall proclaim to be holy convocations, to present an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering and a grain offering, sacrifices and drink offerings, each on its own day. 38‘This is in addition to the [weekly] Sabbaths of the LORD, and in addition to your gifts and all your vowed offerings and all your freewill offerings, which you give to the LORD.\n\n39‘On exactly the fifteenth day of the seventh month (nearly October), when you have gathered in the crops of the land, you shall celebrate the feast of the LORD for seven days, with a Sabbath rest on the first day and a Sabbath rest on the eighth day. 40‘Now on the first day you shall take for yourselves the foliage of beautiful trees, branches of palm trees, and boughs of thick (leafy) trees, and willows of the brook [and make booths of them]; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God for seven days. 41‘You shall celebrate it as a feast to the LORD for seven days in the year. It shall be a permanent statute throughout your generations; you shall celebrate it in the seventh month. 42‘You shall live in booths (temporary shelters) for seven days; all native-born in Israel shall live in booths, 43so that your generations may know that I had the sons of Israel live in booths when I brought them out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.’” 44So Moses declared to the Israelites the appointed feasts of the LORD.\n\nLeviticus 24\nThe Lamp And The Bread Of The Sanctuary\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Command the children of Israel to bring to you clear oil from beaten olives for the light [of the golden lampstand], to make a lamp burn continually. 3Outside the veil of the Testimony [between the Holy Place and the Most Holy Place] in the Tent of Meeting, Aaron shall always keep the lamps burning before the LORD from evening until morning; it shall be a permanent statute throughout your generations. 4He shall keep the lamps burning on the pure gold lampstand before the LORD continually.\n\n5“Then you shall take fine flour and bake twelve cakes (bread of the Presence, showbread) with it; two-tenths of an ephah shall be in each cake (loaf). 6You shall set the bread of the Presence (showbread) in two rows, six in a row, on the pure gold table before the LORD. 7You shall put pure frankincense [in two censers, one] beside each row, so that it may be with the bread as a memorial portion, an offering by fire to the LORD. 8Every Sabbath day Aaron shall arrange the showbread before the LORD continually; it is an everlasting covenant for the Israelites. 9“The bread of the Presence shall be for Aaron and his sons, and they shall eat it in a sacred place, for it is for Aaron a most holy portion of the offerings by fire to the LORD, his portion forever.”\n\n10Now the son of an Israelite woman, whose father was an Egyptian, went out among the Israelites, and he and a man of Israel quarreled and struggled with each other in the camp. 11The Israelite woman’s son blasphemed the Name [of the LORD] and cursed. So they brought him to Moses. (Now his mother’s name was Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan.) 12They put him in custody until the will and command of the LORD might be made clear to them.\n\n13Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 14“Bring the one who has cursed [the LORD] outside the camp, and let all who heard him lay their hands on his head [as witnesses to his guilt]; then let all the congregation stone him. 15You shall speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Whoever curses his God will bear his sin [through his own death]. 16‘Further, the one who blasphemes the name of the LORD shall most certainly be put to death; all the congregation shall stone him. The stranger as well as the native-born shall be put to death when he blasphemes the Name [of the LORD].\n\n“An Eye for an Eye” 17‘If a man takes the life of any human being [unlawfully], he shall most certainly be put to death. 18‘The one who kills an animal shall replace it, animal for animal. 19‘If a man injures his neighbor (fellow citizen), whatever he has done shall be done to him: 20fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth; just as he has injured a man, so shall the same be done to him. 21‘The one who kills an animal shall replace it; but he who kills a human being [unlawfully] shall be put to death. 22‘You shall have one standard of law for the stranger among you as well as for the native, for I am the LORD your God.’” 23Then Moses spoke to the Israelites, and they brought the one who had cursed [the LORD] outside the camp and stoned him with stones. Thus the Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\nLeviticus 25\nThe Sabbatic Year And Year Of Jubilee\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses at Mount Sinai, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘When you come into the land which I am giving you, then the land shall keep a Sabbath to the LORD. 3‘For six years you shall sow your field, and for six years you shall prune your vineyard and gather in its crop. 4‘But in the seventh year there shall be a Sabbath of rest for the land, a Sabbath to the LORD; you shall not sow [seed in] your field nor prune your vineyard. 5‘Whatever reseeds itself (uncultivated) in your harvest you shall not reap, nor shall you gather the grapes from your uncultivated vine, it shall be a year of sabbatical rest for the land. 6‘And all of you shall have for food whatever the [untilled] land produces during its Sabbath year; yourself, and your male and female slaves, your hired servant, and the foreigners who reside among you, 7even your domestic animals and the [wild] animals that are in your land shall have all its crops to eat.\n\nThe Year of Jubilee 8‘You are also to count off seven Sabbaths of years for yourself, seven times seven years, so that you have the time of the seven Sabbaths of years, namely, forty-nine years. 9‘Then you shall sound the ram’s horn everywhere on the tenth day of the seventh month (almost October); on the Day of Atonement you shall sound the trumpet throughout your land. 10‘And you shall consecrate the fiftieth year and proclaim freedom [for the slaves] throughout the land to all its inhabitants. It shall be a Jubilee (year of remission) for you, and each of you shall return to his own [ancestral] property [that was sold to another because of poverty], and each of you shall return to his family [from whom he was separated by bondage]. 11‘That fiftieth year shall be a Jubilee for you; you shall not sow [seed], nor reap what reseeds itself, nor gather the grapes of the uncultivated vines. 12‘For it is the Jubilee; it shall be holy to you; you shall eat its crops out of the field.\n\n13‘In this Year of Jubilee each of you shall return to his own [ancestral] property. 14‘If you sell anything to your friend or buy from your friend, you shall not wrong one another. 15‘According to the number of years after the Jubilee, you shall buy from your friend. And he is to sell to you according to the number of years of crops [which may be harvested before you must restore the property to him]. 16‘If the years [until the next Jubilee] are many, you shall increase the price, but if the years remaining are few, you shall reduce the price, because it is the number of crops that he is selling to you. 17‘You shall not wrong one another, but you shall fear your God [with profound reverence]; for I am the LORD your God.\n\n18‘Therefore you shall carry out My statutes and keep My ordinances and do them, so that you may live securely on the land. 19‘Then the land will yield its produce, so that you can eat your fill and live securely on it. 20‘And if you say, “What are we going to eat in the seventh year if we do not sow [seed] or gather in our crops?” 21then [this is My answer:] I will order My [special] blessing for you in the sixth year, so that it will produce [sufficient] crops for three years. 22‘When you are sowing the eighth year, you can still eat old things from the crops, eating the old until the ninth year when its crop comes in.\n\nThe Law of Redemption 23‘The land shall not be sold permanently, for the land is Mine; you are [only] foreigners and temporary residents with Me. 24‘So in all the country that you possess, you are to provide for the redemption of the land [in the Year of Jubilee].\n\n25‘If a fellow countryman of yours becomes so poor he has to sell some of his property, then his nearest relative is to come and buy back (redeem) what his relative has sold. 26‘Or in case a man has no relative [to redeem his property], but he has become more prosperous and has enough to buy it back, 27then he shall calculate the years since its sale and refund the balance to the man to whom he sold it, and so return to his [ancestral] property. 28‘But if he is unable to redeem it, then what he has sold shall remain in the hands of the purchaser until the Year of Jubilee; but at the Jubilee it shall revert, and he may return to his property.\n\n29‘If a man sells a house in a walled city, then his right of redemption remains valid for a full year after its sale; his right of redemption lasts a full year. 30‘But if it is not redeemed for him within a full year, then the house that is in the walled city passes permanently and irrevocably to the purchaser throughout his generations. It does not revert back in the Year of Jubilee. 31‘The houses of the villages that have no surrounding walls, however, shall be considered as open fields. They may be redeemed, and revert in the Year of Jubilee. 32‘As for the cities of the Levites, the Levites have a permanent right of redemption for the houses in the cities which they possess. 33‘Therefore, what is [purchased] from the Levites may be redeemed [by a Levite], and the house that was sold in the city they possess reverts in the Year of Jubilee, for the houses in the Levite cities are their [ancestral] property among the Israelites. 34‘But the pasture lands of their cities may not be sold, for that is their permanent possession.\n\nOf Poor Countrymen 35‘Now if your fellow countryman becomes poor and his hand falters with you [that is, he has trouble repaying you for something], then you are to help and sustain him, [with courtesy and consideration] like [you would] a stranger or a temporary resident [without property], so that he may live among you. 36‘Do not charge him usurious interest, but fear your God [with profound reverence], so your countryman may [continue to] live among you. 37‘You shall not give him your money at interest, nor your food at a profit. 38‘I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to give you the land of Canaan and to be your God.\n\n39‘And if your fellow countryman becomes so poor [in his dealings] with you that he sells himself to you [as payment for a debt], you shall not let him do the work of a slave [who is ineligible for redemption], 40but he is to be with you as a hired man, as if he were a temporary resident; he shall serve with you until the Year of Jubilee, 41and then he shall leave you, he and his children with him, and shall go back to his own family and return to the property of his fathers. 42‘For the Israelites are My servants whom I brought out of the land of Egypt; they shall not be sold in a slave sale. 43‘You shall not rule over him with harshness (severity, oppression), but you are to fear your God [with profound reverence]. 44‘As for your male and female slaves whom you may have—you may acquire male and female slaves from the pagan nations that are around you. 45‘Moreover, from the children of the strangers who live as aliens among you, from them you may buy slaves and from their families who are with you, whom they have produced in your land; they may become your possession. 46‘You may even bequeath them as an inheritance to your children after you, to receive as a possession; you can use them as permanent slaves. But in respect to your fellow countrymen, the children of Israel, you shall not rule over one another with harshness (severity, oppression).\n\nOf Redeeming a Poor Man 47‘Now if the financial means of a stranger or temporary resident among you become sufficient, and your fellow countryman becomes poor in comparison to him and sells himself to the stranger who is living among you or to the descendants of the stranger’s family, 48then after he is sold he shall have the right of redemption. One of his relatives may redeem him: 49either his uncle or his uncle’s son may redeem him, or one of his blood relatives from his family may redeem him; or if he prospers, he may redeem himself. 50‘Then he [or his redeemer] shall calculate with his purchaser from the year when he sold himself to the purchaser to the Year of Jubilee, and the [original] price of his sale shall be adjusted according to the number of years. The time he was with his owner shall be considered as that of a hired man. 51‘If there are still many years [before the Year of Jubilee], in proportion to them he must refund [to the purchaser] part of the price of his sale for his redemption and release. 52‘And if only a few years remain until the Year of Jubilee, he shall so calculate it with him. He is to refund the proportionate amount for his release. 53‘Like a man hired year by year he shall deal with him; he shall not rule over him with harshness in your sight. 54‘Even if he is not redeemed during these years and under these provisions, then he shall go free in the Year of Jubilee, he and his children with him. 55‘For the children of Israel are My servants; My servants, whom I brought out of the land of Egypt. I am the LORD your God.\n\nLeviticus 26\nBlessings Of Obedience\n\n1‘You shall not make idols for yourselves, nor shall you erect an image, a sacred pillar or an obelisk, nor shall you place any figured stone in your land so that you may bow down to it; for I am the LORD your God. 2‘You shall keep My Sabbaths and have reverence for My sanctuary. I am the LORD. 3‘If you walk in My statutes and keep My commandments and [obediently] do them, 4then I will give you rain in its season, and the land will yield her produce and the trees of the field bear their fruit. 5‘And your threshing season will last until grape gathering and the grape gathering [time] will last until planting, and you will eat your bread and be filled and live securely in your land. 6‘I will also grant peace in the land, so that you may lie down and there will be no one to make you afraid. I will also eliminate harmful animals from the land, and no sword will pass through your land. 7‘And you will chase your enemies, and they will fall before you by the sword. 8‘Five of you will chase a hundred, and a hundred of you will put ten thousand to flight; your enemies will fall before you by the sword. 9‘For I will turn toward you [with favor and regard] and make you fruitful and multiply you, and I will establish and confirm My covenant with you. 10‘You will eat the old supply of [abundant] produce, and clear out the old [to make room] for the new. 11‘I will make My dwelling among you, and My soul will not reject nor separate itself from you. 12‘I will walk among you and be your God, and you shall be My people. 13‘I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt so that you would not be their slaves; and I broke the bars of your yoke and made you walk upright [with heads held high as free men].\n\nPenalties of Disobedience 14‘But if you do not obey Me and do not [obediently] do all these commandments, 15if, instead, you reject My statutes, and if your soul rejects My ordinances, so that you will not [obediently] do all My commandments, and in this way break My covenant, 16I, in turn, will do this to you: I will appoint over you sudden terror, consumption, and fever that will waste away the eyes and cause the soul to languish also. And you will sow your seed uselessly, for your enemies will eat what you plant. 17‘I will set My face against you so that you will be struck down before your enemies; those who hate you will rule over you, and you will flee when no one is pursuing you. 18‘If in spite of all this you still will not listen to Me and be obedient, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins. 19‘I will break your pride in your power, and I will make your sky like iron [giving no rain and blocking all prayers] and your ground like bronze [hard to plow and yielding no produce]. 20‘Your strength will be spent uselessly, for your land will not yield its produce and the trees of the land will not yield their fruit.\n\n21‘If then, you act with hostility toward Me and are unwilling to obey Me, I will increase the plague on you seven times in accordance with your sins. 22‘I will let loose the [wild] animals of the field among you, which will bereave you of your children and destroy your livestock and make you so few in number that your roads will lie deserted and desolate.\n\n23‘And if by these things you are not turned to Me, but act with hostility against Me, 24then I also will act with hostility against you, and I will strike you seven times for your sins. 25‘I will bring a sword on you that will execute vengeance for [breaking] the covenant; and when you gather together in your cities, I will send pestilence (virulent disease) among you, and you shall be handed over to the enemy. 26‘When I break your staff of bread [that is, cut off your supply of food], ten women will bake your bread in one oven, and they will ration your bread; and you will eat and not be satisfied.\n\n27‘Yet if in spite of this you will not [attentively] listen to Me but act with hostility against me, 28then I will act with hostility against you in wrath, and I also will punish you seven times for your sins. 29‘You will eat the flesh of your sons and the flesh of your daughters. 30‘I will destroy your high places [devoted to idolatrous worship], and cut down your incense altars, and heap your dead bodies upon the [crushed] bodies of your idols, and My soul will detest you [with deep and unutterable loathing]. 31‘I will lay waste your cities as well and will make your sanctuaries desolate, and I will not smell your sweet and soothing aromas [of offerings by fire]. 32‘I will make the land desolate, and your enemies who settle in it will be appalled at it. 33‘I will scatter you among the nations and draw out the sword [of your enemies] after you; your land will become desolate and your cities will become ruins.\n\n34‘Then the land [of Israel] will enjoy its Sabbaths as long as it lies desolate, while you are in your enemies’ land; then the land will rest and enjoy its Sabbaths. 35‘As long as it lies desolate, it will have rest, the rest it did not have on your Sabbaths, while you were living on it. 36‘As for those who are left of you, I will bring despair (lack of courage, weakness) into their hearts in the lands of their enemies; the sound of a scattered leaf will put them to flight, and they will flee as if [running] from the sword, and will fall even when no one is chasing them. 37‘They shall stumble over one another as if to escape from a sword when no one is chasing them; and you will have no power to stand before your enemies. 38‘You will perish among the nations; the land of your enemies will consume you. 39‘Those of you who are left will rot away because of their wickedness in the lands of your enemies; also because of the wickedness of their forefathers they will rot away like them.\n\n40‘If they confess their wickedness and the wickedness of their forefathers, in their unfaithfulness which they have committed against Me—and also in their acting with hostility toward Me— 41I also was acting with hostility toward them and brought them into the land of their enemies—then if their uncircumcised (sin-filled) hearts are humbled and they accept the punishment for their wickedness, 42then I will remember My covenant with Jacob, and also My covenant with Isaac, and also My covenant with Abraham, and remember the land. 43‘But the land will be abandoned by them and will enjoy its Sabbaths while it lies desolate without them; and they will accept the punishment for their wickedness and make amends because they rejected My ordinances and their soul rejected My statutes. 44‘Yet in spite of this, when they are in the land of their enemies, I will not reject them, nor will I so despise them as to destroy them, breaking My covenant with them; for I am the LORD their God. 45‘But I will, for their sake, [earnestly] remember the covenant with their forefathers, whom I have brought out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God. I am the LORD.’”\n\n46These are the statutes, ordinances, and laws which the LORD established between Himself and the Israelites through Moses at Mount Sinai.\n\nLeviticus 27\nRules Concerning Valuations\n\n1Again, the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the children of Israel and say to them, ‘When a man makes a special vow [consecrating himself or a member of his family], he shall be valued according to your [established system of] valuation of people belonging to the LORD [that is, the priest accepts from the man making the vow a specified amount of money for the temple treasury in place of the actual person]. 3‘If your valuation is of a male between twenty and sixty years of age, then your valuation shall be fifty shekels of silver, according to the shekel of the sanctuary. 4‘Or if the person is a female, then your valuation shall be thirty shekels. 5‘If the person is between five years and twenty years of age, then your valuation for the male shall be twenty shekels and for the female ten shekels. 6‘But if the child is between one month and five years of age, then your valuation shall be five shekels of silver for the male and three shekels for the female. 7‘If the person is sixty years old and above, your valuation shall be fifteen shekels for the male, and ten shekels for the female. 8‘But if the person is too poor to pay your valuation, then he shall be placed before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to the ability of the one who vowed, the priest shall value him.\n\n9‘Now if it is an animal of the kind which men can present as an offering to the LORD, any such that one gives to the LORD shall be holy. 10‘He shall not replace it or exchange it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good; but if he does exchange an animal for an animal, then both the original offering and its substitute shall be holy. 11‘If it is any unclean animal of the kind which men do not present as an offering to the LORD, then he shall bring the animal before the priest, 12and the priest shall value it as either good or bad; it shall be as you, the priest, value it. 13‘But if he ever wishes to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of it to your valuation.\n\n14‘If a man consecrates his house as sacred to the LORD, the priest shall appraise it as either good or bad; as the priest appraises it, so shall it stand. 15‘If the one who consecrates his house should wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of your valuation price to it, so that it may be his.\n\n16‘And if a man consecrates to the LORD part of a field of his own property, then your valuation shall be proportionate to the seed needed for it; a homer of barley seed shall be valued at fifty shekels of silver. 17‘If he consecrates his field during the Year of Jubilee, it shall stand according to your valuation. 18‘But if he consecrates his field after the Jubilee, then the priest shall calculate the price for him in proportion to the years that remain until the Year of Jubilee; and it shall be deducted from your valuation. 19‘If the one who consecrates the field should ever wish to redeem it, then he shall add one-fifth of the appraisal price to it, so that it may return to him. 20‘If he does not redeem the field, but has sold it to another man, it may no longer be redeemed. 21‘When the field reverts in the Jubilee, the field shall be holy to the LORD, like a field set apart (devoted); the priest shall possess it as his property. 22‘Or if a man consecrates to the LORD a field which he has bought, which is not part of the field of his [ancestral] property, 23then the priest shall calculate for him the amount of your valuation up to the Year of Jubilee; and the man shall give that [amount] on that day as a holy thing to the LORD. 24‘In the Year of Jubilee the field shall return to the one from whom it was purchased, to whom the land belonged [as his ancestral inheritance]. 25‘Every valuation of yours shall be in accordance with the sanctuary shekel; twenty gerahs shall make a shekel.\n\n26‘However, the firstborn among animals, which as a firstborn belongs to the LORD, no man may consecrate, whether an ox or a sheep. It is [already] the LORD’S. 27‘If it is among the unclean animals, the owner may redeem it in accordance with your valuation, and add one-fifth to it; or if it is not redeemed, then it shall be sold in accordance with your valuation.\n\n28‘But nothing that a man sets apart [that is, devotes as an offering] to the LORD out of all that he has, of man or of animal or of the fields of his own property, shall be sold or redeemed. Anything devoted to destruction (banned, cursed) is most holy to the LORD. 29‘No one who may have been set apart among men shall be ransomed [from death], he shall most certainly be put to death.\n\n30‘And all the tithe (tenth part) of the land, whether the seed of the land or the fruit of the tree, is the LORD’S; it is holy to the LORD. 31‘If a man wishes to redeem any part of his tithe, he shall add one-fifth to it. 32‘For every tithe of the herd or flock, whatever passes under the [shepherd’s] staff, the tenth one shall be holy to the LORD. 33‘The man is not to be concerned whether the animal is good or bad, nor shall he exchange it. But if he does exchange it, then both it and its substitute shall become holy; it shall not be redeemed.’”\n\n34These are the commandments which the LORD commanded Moses on Mount Sinai for the children of Israel."

          "content": "Numbers 1\nThe Census Of Israel’s Warriors\n\n1The LORD spoke [by special revelation] to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) on the first day of the second month in the second year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, saying, 2“Take a census of all the congregation of the sons of Israel, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, every male, head by head 3from twenty years old and upward, all in Israel who are able to go out to war. You and Aaron shall number them, army by army. 4And with you there shall be a man [to assist you] from each tribe, each being the head of his father’s household. 5These then are the names of the men who shall stand with you: from [the tribe of] Reuben, Elizur the son of Shedeur; 6from [the tribe of] Simeon, Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai; 7from [the tribe of] Judah, Nahshon the son of Amminadab; 8from [the tribe of] Issachar, Nethanel the son of Zuar; 9from [the tribe of] Zebulun, Eliab the son of Helon; 10from the sons (descendants) of Joseph: from [the tribe of] Ephraim, Elishama the son of Ammihud; from [the tribe of] Manasseh, Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur; 11from [the tribe of] Benjamin, Abidan the son of Gideoni; 12from [the tribe of] Dan, Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai; 13from [the tribe of] Asher, Pagiel the son of Ochran; 14from [the tribe of] Gad, Eliasaph the son of Deuel; 15from [the tribe of] Naphtali, Ahira the son of Enan. 16“These men were the ones called from the congregation, the leaders of their fathers’ (ancestors’) tribes; they were the heads of thousands [the highest ranking officers] in Israel.”\n\n17So Moses and Aaron took these men who were designated by name, 18and assembled all the congregation on the first day of the second month, and they registered by ancestry in their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names from twenty years old and upward, head by head, 19just as the LORD had commanded Moses. So he numbered them in the Wilderness of Sinai.\n\n20The sons of Reuben, Israel’s (Jacob’s) firstborn, their generations, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 21those of the tribe of Reuben numbered 46,500.\n\n22Of the sons of Simeon, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, their numbered men according to the number of names, head by head, every male from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 23those of the tribe of Simeon numbered 59,300.\n\n24Of the sons of Gad, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 25those of the tribe of Gad numbered 45,650.\n\n26Of the sons of Judah, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 27those of the tribe of Judah numbered 74,600.\n\n28Of the sons of Issachar, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 29those of the tribe of Issachar numbered 54,400.\n\n30Of the sons of Zebulun, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 31those of the tribe of Zebulun numbered 57,400.\n\n32Of the sons of Joseph: the sons (descendants) of Ephraim, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 33those of the tribe of Ephraim numbered 40,500.\n\n34Of the sons of Manasseh, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 35those of the tribe of Manasseh numbered 32,200.\n\n36Of the sons of Benjamin, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 37those of the tribe of Benjamin numbered 35,400.\n\n38Of the sons of Dan, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 39those of the tribe of Dan numbered 62,700.\n\n40Of the sons of Asher, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 41those of the tribe of Asher numbered 41,500.\n\n42Of the sons of Naphtali, their descendants, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, according to the number of names, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war: 43those of the tribe of Naphtali numbered 53,400.\n\n44These were the ones who were numbered, whom Moses and Aaron numbered, with the leaders of Israel, twelve men, each representing his fathers’ household. 45So all those numbered of the sons of Israel, by their fathers’ households, from twenty years old and upward, all who were able to go to war in Israel, 46all who were numbered were 603,550.\n\nLevites Exempted 47The Levites, however, were not numbered among them by their fathers’ tribe. 48For the LORD had said to Moses, 49“Only the tribe of Levi you shall not number, nor shall you take their census among the sons of Israel [since they are unavailable to go to war]. 50But appoint the Levites over the tabernacle (sanctuary) of the Testimony, and over all its furnishings and all things that belong to it. They shall carry the tabernacle [when traveling] and all its furnishings, and they shall take care of it and camp around it. 51When the tabernacle is to go forward, the Levites shall take it down; and when the tabernacle is to [be set up for] camp, the Levites shall set it up. But the layman (non-Levite) who approaches the tabernacle shall be put to death. 52The Israelites shall camp according to their armies, every man by his own camp and every man by his own [tribal] standard (banner). 53“But the Levites shall camp around the tabernacle of the Testimony, so that there will be no wrath against the congregation of the Israelites. The Levites shall be in charge of the tabernacle of the Testimony.” 54Thus the sons of Israel did these things; according to all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so they did.\n\nNumbers 2\nArrangement Of The Camps\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2“The sons of Israel shall camp, each by his own standard, with the banners of their fathers’ households; they shall camp around the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), but at a distance. 3Those who camp on the east side toward the sunrise shall be of the standard of the camp of Judah, by their armies; and Nahshon the son of Amminadab shall lead the sons of Judah, 4and his army as numbered totaled 74,600. 5Next to Judah [on the east side] the tribe of Issachar shall encamp; and Nethanel the son of Zuar shall lead the sons of Issachar, 6and his army as numbered totaled 54,400. 7Then [also on the east side] the tribe of Zebulun; and Eliab the son of Helon shall lead the sons of Zebulun, 8and his army as numbered totaled 57,400. 9The total of the numbered men [in the three tribes on the east side] in the camp of Judah was 186,400, by their armies. They shall move out first [on the march].\n\n10“On the south side shall be the standard of the camp of Reuben, by their armies; and Elizur the son of Shedeur shall lead the sons of Reuben, 11and his army as numbered totaled 46,500. 12Those who camp next to Reuben [on the south side] shall be the tribe of Simeon; and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai shall lead the sons of Simeon, 13and his army as numbered totaled 59,300. 14Then [completing the south side] the tribe of Gad; and Eliasaph the son of Reuel (Deuel) shall lead the sons of Gad, 15and his army as numbered totaled 45,650. 16The total of the numbered men [in the three tribes on the south side] in the camp of Reuben was 151,450, by their armies. They shall move out second [on the march].\n\n17“Then the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) shall move out with the camp of the Levites in the middle of the [other] camps; just as they camp so shall they move out, every man in his place by their standards.\n\n18“On the west side shall be the standard of the camp of Ephraim, by their armies; and Elishama the son of Ammihud shall lead the sons of Ephraim, 19and his army as numbered totaled 40,500. 20Beside Ephraim [on the west side] shall be the tribe of Manasseh; and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur shall lead the sons of Manasseh, 21and his army as numbered totaled 32,200. 22Then [completing the west side shall be] the tribe of Benjamin; and Abidan the son of Gideoni shall lead the sons of Benjamin, 23and his army as numbered totaled 35,400. 24The total of the numbered men [of the three tribes on the west side] in the camp of Ephraim was 108,100, by their armies. They shall move out in third place.\n\n25“On the north side shall be the standard of the camp of Dan, by their armies; and Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai shall lead the sons of Dan, 26and his army as numbered totaled 62,700. 27Encamped next to Dan [on the north side] shall be the tribe of Asher; and Pagiel the son of Ochran shall lead the sons of Asher, 28and his army as numbered totaled 41,500. 29Then [completing the north side] comes the tribe of Naphtali; and Ahira the son of Enan shall lead the sons of Naphtali, 30and his army as numbered totaled 53,400. 31“The total of the numbered men [of the three tribes on the north side] in the camp of Dan was 157,600. They shall move out last, standard after standard.”\n\n32These are the men of the Israelites [twenty years old and upward] as numbered by their fathers’ households. The total of the numbered men of the camps by their armies, 603,550. 33But the Levites were not numbered with the [other] Israelites, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 34Thus the Israelites did [as ordered]; according to everything the LORD had commanded Moses, so they camped by their standards, and so they moved out, everyone with his family (clan), according to his fathers’ household.\n\nNumbers 3\nLevites To Be Priesthood\n\n1Now these are the records of the generations of Aaron and Moses in the day when the LORD spoke [by special revelation] with Moses on Mount Sinai. 2These are the names of the sons of Aaron: Nadab the firstborn, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 3These are the names of the sons of Aaron, the priests who were anointed, whom Aaron consecrated and ordained to minister in the priest’s office. 4But Nadab and Abihu died in the presence of the LORD when they offered strange (unholy, unacceptable, inappropriate) fire before the LORD in the Wilderness of Sinai; and they had no sons. So Eleazar and Ithamar served as priests in the presence and under the supervision of Aaron their father.\n\n5Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 6“Bring the tribe of Levi near and present them before Aaron the priest, so that they may serve him. 7They shall carry out the duties for him and for the whole congregation before the Tent of Meeting, doing the service of the tabernacle. 8They shall also take care of all the furnishings and utensils of the Tent of Meeting, and [attend to] the duties of the Israelites, doing the service of the tabernacle. 9You shall give the Levites to Aaron and to his sons [as servants and helpers]; they are to be given wholly to him from among the Israelites. 10“So you shall appoint Aaron and his sons, and they shall observe and attend to their priesthood; but the layman (non-Levite) who approaches [the holy things] shall be put to death.”\n\n11Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 12“Behold, I have taken the Levites from among the sons of Israel instead of and as a substitute for every firstborn, that is, the first that opens the womb among the Israelites. So the Levites shall be Mine, 13for all the firstborn are Mine. On the day that I killed all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for Myself all the firstborn in Israel, both man and animal. They shall be mine; I am the LORD.”\n\n14Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai, saying, 15“Number the sons of Levi by their fathers’ households, by their families (clans). You shall number every male from a month old and upward.” 16So Moses numbered them just as he was commanded by the word (mouth) of the LORD. 17These are the [three] sons of Levi by their names: Gershon, Kohath, and Merari. 18These are the names of the [two] sons of Gershon by their families: Libni and Shimei; 19and the [four] sons of Kohath by their families: Amram, Izhar, Hebron, and Uzziel; 20and the [two] sons of Merari by their families: Mahli and Mushi. These are the families of the Levites by their fathers’ households.\n\n21Of Gershon were the families of the Libnites and of the Shimeites. These are the families of the Gershonites. 22The males who were numbered, every male from a month old and upward totaled 7,500. 23The families of the Gershonites were to camp behind the tabernacle on the west, 24and the leader of the fathers’ households of the Gershonites was Eliasaph the son of Lael. Duties of the Levites 25Now the responsibilities of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting involved the tabernacle and the tent, its covering, and the curtain for the doorway of the Tent of Meeting, 26and the hangings of the courtyard, the curtain for the doorway of the courtyard which is around the tabernacle and the altar, its tent ropes, and all the service concerning them.\n\n27Of Kohath were the families of the Amramites, the Izharites, the Hebronites, and the Uzzielites; these are the families of the Kohathites. 28The males who were numbered, every male from a month old and upward totaled 8,600, attending to the duties of the sanctuary. 29The families of the sons of Kohath were to camp on the south side of the tabernacle, 30and the leader of the fathers’ households of the families of the Kohathites was Elizaphan the son of Uzziel. 31Now their responsibilities involved the ark, the table [on which the bread of the Presence was placed], the lampstand, the altars, the utensils of the sanctuary with which the priests minister, and the curtain, and all the service concerning them. 32Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, was chief of the leaders of the Levites; he supervised those who performed the duties of the sanctuary.\n\n33Of Merari were the families of the Mahlites and the Mushites; these are the families of Merari. 34The males who were numbered, every male from a month old and upward totaled 6,200. 35The leader of the fathers’ households of the families of Merari was Zuriel the son of Abihail. The Merarites were to camp on the north side of the tabernacle. 36Now the appointed responsibilities of the sons of Merari involved the frames of the tabernacle, its bars, its pillars, its sockets or bases, and all the equipment, and all the service concerning them, 37and the pillars around the courtyard with their bases and their pegs and their cords (tent ropes).\n\n38Now those to camp before the tabernacle toward the east, before the Tent of Meeting, toward the sunrise, were to be Moses, and Aaron and his sons, performing the duties of the sanctuary for whatever was required of the Israelites; and the layman (non-Levite) who approached [the sanctuary] was to be put to death. 39All the men of the Levites whom Moses and Aaron numbered at the command of the LORD, by their families, every male from a month old and upward, were 22,000.\n\nFirstborn Redeemed 40Then the LORD said to Moses, “Number every firstborn male of the Israelites from a month old and upward, and make a list of their names. 41“You shall take the Levites for Me instead of and as a substitute for all the firstborn among the Israelites. I am the LORD; and you shall take the cattle of the Levites instead of and as a substitute for all the firstborn among the cattle of the Israelites.” 42So Moses numbered all the firstborn among the Israelites, just as the LORD had commanded him; 43and all the firstborn males from a month old and upward as numbered were 22,273 [273 more than the Levites].\n\n44Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 45“Take the Levites [for Me] instead of all the firstborn among the sons of Israel, and the cattle of the Levites instead of their cattle. And the Levites shall be Mine. I am the LORD. 46For the ransom (redemption price) of the 273 of the firstborn of the Israelites who outnumber the Levites, 47you shall take five shekels apiece, per head, you shall take them in terms of the sanctuary shekel (the shekel is twenty gerahs), 48and give the money, the ransom (redemption price) of those who outnumber the Levites to Aaron and to his sons.” 49So Moses took the ransom (redemption) money from those who were in excess, beyond those ransomed by the Levites; 50from the firstborn of the Israelites he took the money in terms of the sanctuary shekel, 1,365 shekels. 51Then Moses gave the ransom money to Aaron and to his sons at the command of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\nNumbers 4\nDuties Of The Kohathites\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2“Take a census of the sons of Kohath from among the sons of Levi, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, 3from thirty years old and upward, even to fifty years old, all who enter the service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 4This is the work and responsibility of the sons of Kohath in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle): the most holy things.\n\n5“When the camp prepares to move out, Aaron and his sons shall come into the sanctuary and take down the veil (curtain) screening off the Holy of Holies, and cover the ark of the testimony with it; 6and they shall put on it a covering of porpoise skin (fine leather), and shall spread over that a cloth of pure blue, and shall insert the carrying poles of the ark. 7Over the table of the bread of the Presence they shall spread a cloth of blue and put on it the plates, the dishes [for incense], the sacrificial bowls, the jars for the drink offering, and the continual bread [of the Presence] shall be on it. 8They shall spread over them a cloth of scarlet, and cover that with a covering of porpoise skin, and they shall insert its carrying poles. 9Then they shall take a blue cloth and cover the lampstand for the light, along with its lamps, its wick cutters, its trays, and all the oil vessels, by which it is supplied; 10and they shall put the lampstand and all its utensils in a covering of porpoise skin, and shall put it on the carrying bars. 11Over the golden [incense] altar they shall spread a blue cloth, and cover it with a covering of porpoise skin, and shall insert its carrying poles; 12and they shall take all the utensils of the service with which they minister in the sanctuary, and put them in a blue cloth, and cover them with a covering of porpoise skin, and put them on the carrying bars. 13Then they shall clean away the ashes from the altar [of burnt offering], and spread a purple cloth over it. 14They shall also put on it all its utensils with which they minister in connection with it: the pans, the meat-forks, the shovels, the basins, and all the utensils of the altar; and they shall spread a covering of porpoise skin over it, and insert its carrying poles. 15When Aaron and his sons have finished covering the sanctuary and all its furniture, as the camp sets out, after all that [is done, but not before], the sons of Kohath shall come to carry them [using the poles], so that they do not touch the holy things, and die. These are the things in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) which the sons of Kohath are to carry.\n\n16“The responsibility of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, is the oil for the light, the fragrant incense, the continual grain offering, and the anointing oil—the responsibility of all the tabernacle and everything that is in it, with the sanctuary and its furnishings.”\n\n17Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 18“Do not cut off (eliminate, destroy) the tribe of the families of the Kohathites [who are only Levites and not priests], from among the Levites [by exposing them to the sin of touching the most holy things]. 19But deal with them in this way, so that they may live and not die when they approach the most holy things: Aaron and his sons shall go in and assign each of them to his [specific] work and to his load [to be carried on the march]. 20“But the Kohathites shall not go in to see the holy things, even for an instant, or they will die.”\n\nDuties of the Gershonites 21Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 22“Take a census of the sons of Gershon also, by their fathers’ households, by their families. 23From thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them; all who enter for service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting. 24This is the service of the families of the Gershonites, in serving and in carrying [when on the march]: 25they shall carry the tent curtains of the tabernacle, and the Tent of Meeting, its covering and the covering of porpoise skin (fine leather) that is on top of it, and the curtain for the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), 26and the hangings of the courtyard, and the curtain for the entrance of the gate of the courtyard which is around the tabernacle and the altar, and their tent ropes, and all the equipment for their service; and all that is to be done, they shall perform. 27Aaron and his sons shall direct all the service of the sons of the Gershonites, all they have to carry and all they have to do. You shall assign to them as a duty all that they are to carry [on the march]. 28This is the service of the families of the sons of Gershon in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle); and their duties shall be under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron, the [high] priest.\n\nDuties of the Merarites 29“As for the sons of Merari, you shall number them by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households; 30from thirty years and upward to fifty years old, you shall number them, everyone who enters the service to do the work of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 31This is what they are assigned to carry [on the march], according to all their service in the Tent of Meeting: the boards [for the framework] of the tabernacle and its bars and its pillars and its sockets or bases, 32and the pillars around the courtyard with their sockets or bases and their pegs and their cords (tent ropes), with all their equipment and with all their [accessories for] service; and you shall assign each man by name the items he is to carry [on the march]. 33“This is the work of the families of the sons of Merari, according to all their tasks in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), under the direction of Ithamar the son of Aaron, the priest.”\n\n34So Moses and Aaron and the leaders of the congregation numbered the sons of the Kohathites by their families (clans) and by their fathers’ households, 35from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who enters the service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle); 36the men who were numbered by their families were 2,750. 37These were numbered of the families of the Kohathites, all who did service in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), whom Moses and Aaron numbered according to the commandment of the LORD through Moses.\n\n38The men who were numbered of the sons of Gershon, by their families (clans), and by their fathers’ households, 39from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service to do the work in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle); 40the men who were numbered by their families, by their fathers’ households, were 2,630. 41These were numbered men of the families of the sons of Gershon, everyone who served in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), whom Moses and Aaron numbered just as the LORD had commanded.\n\n42The men who were numbered of the sons of Merari, by their families (clans), by their fathers’ households, 43from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who entered the service for work in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle); 44the men who were numbered by their families were 3,200. 45These are the men who were numbered of the families of the sons of Merari, whom Moses and Aaron numbered in accordance with the commandment of the LORD through Moses.\n\n46All the men who were numbered of the Levites, whom Moses and Aaron and the leaders of Israel counted by their families (clans) and by their fathers’ households, 47from thirty years and upward even to fifty years old, everyone who could enter to do the work of service and the work of carrying in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle); 48the men that were numbered were 8,580. 49According to the commandment of the LORD through Moses, they were numbered, each assigned to his work of serving and carrying. Thus they were numbered by him, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\nNumbers 5\nOn Defilement\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Command the Israelites to send away from the camp every leper and everyone who has a discharge, and whoever is defiled [that is, ceremonially unclean] by [coming in contact with] the dead. 3“You shall send away both male and female; you shall send them outside the camp so that they will not defile their camp where I dwell in their midst.” 4The Israelites did so, and sent them outside the camp; just as the LORD had said to Moses, so the Israelites did.\n\n5And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 6“Say to the Israelites, ‘When a man or woman commits any of the sins of mankind [against other people], thus breaking faith with the LORD, and that person is guilty, 7then he shall confess the sin which he has committed, and he shall make restitution for his wrong in full, and add a fifth to it, and give it to [the person] whom he has wronged. 8‘But if the man [who was wronged] has no redeemer (relative) to whom the restitution may be made, it is to be given to the LORD for the priest, besides the ram of atonement with which atonement is made for the offender. 9‘Also every contribution pertaining to all the holy gifts of the Israelites which they offer to the priest, shall be his. 10‘And every man’s holy gifts shall be the priest’s; whatever any man gives the priest, it becomes his.’”\n\nThe Adultery Test 11Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 12“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘If any man’s wife goes astray (deviates) and is unfaithful to him, 13and a man is intimate with her, and it is hidden from the eyes of her husband and it is kept secret, although she has defiled herself, and there is no witness against her and she has not been caught in the act, 14and if a spirit (sense, attitude) of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous and angry at his wife who has defiled herself—or if a spirit of jealousy comes over him and he is jealous of his wife when she has not defiled herself— 15then the man shall bring his wife to the priest, and he shall bring as an offering for her, a tenth of an ephah of barley meal; he shall not pour oil on it nor put frankincense on it [the symbols of favor and joy], because it is a grain offering of jealousy, a memorial grain offering, a reminder of [the consequences of] wickedness.\n\n16‘Then the priest shall have her approach and have her stand before the LORD, 17and the priest shall take holy water [from the sacred basin] in an earthenware vessel; and he shall take some of the dust that is on the floor of the tabernacle and put it in the water. 18‘The priest shall then have the woman stand before the LORD, and let the hair of the woman’s head hang loose, and put the memorial grain offering in her hands, which is the jealousy offering, and in the hand of the priest is to be the water of bitterness that brings a curse. 19‘Then the priest shall have her take an oath and say to the woman, If no man has lain with you and if you have not gone astray into uncleanness [while married], then be immune to this water of bitterness that brings a curse; 20but if you have gone astray [while married] and you have defiled yourself and a man other than your husband has been intimate with you” 21(then the priest shall have the woman swear the oath of the curse, and say to the woman), “The LORD make you a curse and an oath among your people when the LORD makes your thigh waste away and your abdomen swell; 22and this water that brings a curse shall go into your stomach, and make your abdomen swell and your thigh waste away.” And the woman shall say, “Amen. Amen (so let it be).”\n\n23‘The priest shall then write these curses on a scroll and shall wash them off into the water of bitterness; 24and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings a curse, and the water that brings the curse will go into her and cause bitterness. 25‘Then the priest shall take the grain offering of jealousy out of the woman’s hand, and he shall wave the grain offering before the LORD and offer it on the altar. 26‘Then the priest shall take a handful of the grain offering as the memorial portion of it and offer it up in smoke on the altar, and afterward he shall make the woman drink the water. 27‘When he has made her drink the water, then it shall come about, that if she has defiled herself and has been unfaithful to her husband, the curse water will go into her and cause bitterness and cause her abdomen to swell and her thigh to waste away, and the woman will become a curse among her people. 28‘But if the woman has not defiled herself and is clean, then she will be free and conceive children.\n\n29‘This is the law of jealousy: when a wife goes astray [while married] and defiles herself, 30or when a spirit (sense, attitude) of jealousy and suspicion comes on a man and he is jealous of his wife; then he shall have the woman stand before the LORD, and the priest shall apply this law to her. 31‘Further, the husband will be free from guilt, but that woman [if guilty] shall bear her guilt.’”\n\nNumbers 6\nLaw Of The Nazirites\n\n1Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Say to the sons of Israel, ‘When a man or a woman makes a special vow, the vow of a Nazirite, that is, one separated and dedicated to the LORD, 3he shall abstain from wine and strong drink; he shall drink no vinegar, whether made from wine or strong drink, nor shall he drink any grape juice nor eat fresh or dried grapes. 4‘All the time of his separation he shall not eat anything produced from the grapevine, from the seeds even to the skins.\n\n5‘All the time of the vow of his separation no razor shall be used on his head. Until the time of his separation to the LORD is completed, he shall be holy, and shall let the hair of his head grow long.\n\n6‘All the time that he separates himself to the LORD he shall not go near a dead body. 7‘He shall not make himself [ceremonially] unclean for his father, mother, brother, or sister, when they die, because [the responsibility for] his separation to God is on his head. 8‘All the time of his separation he is holy to the LORD.\n\n9‘If a man dies very suddenly beside him, and he defiles his dedicated head, then he shall shave his head on the day that he becomes [ceremonially] clean; he shall shave it on the seventh day [the end of the purification period]. 10‘On the eighth day he shall bring two turtledoves or two young pigeons to the priest, to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 11‘The priest shall offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering and make atonement for him concerning his sin because of the [dead] body. He shall consecrate his head the same day, 12and he shall dedicate himself to the LORD for the time of his separation and shall bring a male lamb a year old as a guilt offering; but the previous days will be void and lost, because his separation was defiled.\n\n13‘Now this is the law of the Nazirite when the days of his separation and dedication are fulfilled: he shall bring the offering to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 14and he shall offer his gift to the LORD: one male lamb a year old without blemish as a burnt offering, and one female lamb a year old without blemish as a sin offering, and one ram without blemish as a peace offering, 15and a basket of unleavened bread, cakes of fine flour mixed with oil, and wafers of unleavened bread spread with oil, along with their grain offering and their drink offering. 16‘Then the priest shall present them before the LORD and shall offer the person’s sin offering and his burnt offering. 17‘He shall also offer the ram as a sacrifice of peace offerings to the LORD, together with the basket of unleavened bread; the priest shall offer also its grain offering and its drink offering. 18‘The Nazirite shall shave his dedicated head at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), and take the dedicated hair of his head and put it on the fire which is under the sacrifice of the peace offerings. 19‘The priest shall take the boiled shoulder of the ram, and one unleavened [ring-shaped] loaf out of the basket, and one unleavened flat cake and shall put them on the hands of the Nazirite after he has shaved his dedicated hair. 20‘Then the priest shall wave them as a wave offering before the LORD; they are a holy portion for the priest, together with the breast that is waved and the thigh that is offered by lifting up; and afterward the Nazirite may drink wine.’\n\n21“This is the law for the Nazirite who vows his offering to the LORD for his separation, besides what else he is able to afford, according to the vow which he has vowed; so shall he do according to the law for his separation and abstinence [as a Nazirite].”\n\nAaron’s Benediction 22Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 23“Speak to Aaron and his sons, saying, ‘This is the way you shall bless the Israelites. Say to them:\n24The LORD bless you, and keep you [protect you, sustain you, and guard you];\n25The LORD make His face shine upon you [with favor],\nAnd be gracious to you [surrounding you with lovingkindness];\n26The LORD lift up His countenance (face) upon you [with divine approval],\nAnd give you peace [a tranquil heart and life].’\n\n27“So Aaron and his sons shall put My name upon the children of Israel, and I will bless them.”\n\nNumbers 7\nOfferings Of The Leaders\n\n1On the day that Moses had finished setting up the tabernacle and had anointed and consecrated it and all its furniture, and the altar and all its utensils; he also anointed them and consecrated them [for holy use]. 2Then the leaders of Israel, the heads of their fathers’ households, made offerings. (These were the leaders of the tribes; they were the ones who were over the men who were numbered.) 3They brought their offering before the LORD, six covered carts and twelve oxen; a cart for each two of the leaders and an ox for each one; and they presented them before the tabernacle. 4Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 5“Accept these things from them, so that they may be used in the service of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), and give them to the Levites, to each man according to his service.” 6So Moses took the carts and the oxen and gave them to the Levites. 7He gave two carts and four oxen to the sons of Gershon, according to their service [in transporting the tabernacle]; 8and he gave four carts and eight oxen to the sons of Merari, according to their service [in transporting the tabernacle], under the supervision of Ithamar the son of Aaron, the [high] priest. 9But to the sons of Kohath he gave nothing, because they were assigned the care of the holy things which they carried on their shoulders [when the tabernacle was moved].\n\n10The leaders offered the dedication sacrifices for the altar on the day that it was anointed; and they offered their sacrifice before the altar. 11Then the LORD said to Moses, “Let them present their offerings, one leader each day, for the dedication of the altar.”\n\n12Now the one who presented his offering on the first day was Nahshon the son of Amminadab, of the tribe of Judah; 13and his offering was one silver dish, the weight of which was a hundred and thirty shekels, one silver basin of seventy shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, both of them full of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering; 14one golden bowl of ten shekels, full of incense; 15one young bull, one ram, one male lamb one year old, as a burnt offering; 16one male goat as a sin offering; 17and for the sacrifice of peace offerings, two oxen, five rams, five male goats, five male lambs one year old.

This was the offering of Ahira the son of Enan [from the tribe of Naphtali].\n\n84This was the dedication offering for the altar from the leaders of Israel on the day when it was anointed: twelve dishes of silver, twelve silver basins, twelve golden bowls; 85each dish of silver weighing a hundred and thirty shekels, each basin seventy [shekels]; all the silver vessels weighed 2,400 shekels, according to the shekel of the sanctuary; 86the twelve golden bowls, full of incense, weighing ten shekels apiece, according to the shekel of the sanctuary, all the gold of the bowls being a hundred and twenty shekels; 87all the oxen for the burnt offering were twelve bulls, the rams twelve, the male lambs one year old twelve, together with their grain offering; and the male goats as a sin offering twelve; 88and all the oxen for the sacrifice of the peace offerings were twenty-four bulls, the rams sixty, the male goats sixty, the male lambs one year old sixty. This was the dedication for the altar [of burnt offering] after it was anointed.\n\n89Now when Moses went into the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) to speak with the LORD, he heard the voice speaking to him from above the mercy seat (the gold cover) that was on the ark of the Testimony from between the two cherubim; and He spoke [by special revelation] to him.\n\nNumbers 8\nThe Seven Lamps\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to Aaron and say to him, ‘When you set up and light the lamps, the seven lamps will shine in front of the lampstand.’” 3And Aaron did so; he set up the lamps at the front of the lampstand, just as the LORD had commanded Moses. 4Now this was the workmanship of the lampstand: hammered work of gold; from its base to its flowers it was hammered work; according to the pattern which the LORD had shown Moses, so he made the lampstand.\n\nCleansing the Levites 5Again the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 6“Take the Levites from among the sons of Israel and cleanse them. 7This is what you shall do to them to [ceremonially] cleanse them: sprinkle the water of purification on them, and let them use a razor over their whole body and wash their clothes, and they will be clean. 8Then let them take a young bull and its grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil, and you shall take another young bull as a sin offering. 9You shall present the Levites before the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), and you shall also assemble the whole congregation of the children of Israel, 10and present the Levites before the LORD, and the Israelites shall lay their hands on the Levites. 11Aaron shall present the Levites before the LORD as a wave offering from the Israelites, so that they may perform the service of the LORD. 12Then the Levites shall lay their hands on the heads of the bulls, then you are to offer the one as a sin offering and the other as a burnt offering to the LORD, to make atonement for the Levites. 13You shall have the Levites stand before Aaron and his sons and present them as a wave offering to the LORD.\n\n14“Thus you shall separate the Levites from among the Israelites, and the Levites shall be Mine [in a very special sense]. 15Then after that the Levites may go in to serve the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), but you shall cleanse them [first] and present them as a wave offering; 16for they are wholly given to Me from among the Israelites. I have taken them for Myself instead of all who are born first, the firstborn of all the Israelites. 17For all the firstborn among the Israelites are Mine, among the men and among the animals; on the day that I struck down every firstborn in the land of Egypt, I sanctified and set the Israelites apart for Myself. 18And I have taken the Levites instead of every firstborn among the Israelites. 19“I have given the Levites as a gift to Aaron and to his sons from among the Israelites, to perform the service of the Israelites at the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) and to make atonement for them, so that there will be no plague among the Israelites if they should approach the sanctuary.”\n\n20Thus Moses and Aaron and all the congregation of the children of Israel did [these things] to the Levites; in accordance with all that the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so the Israelites did to them. 21The Levites, too, purified themselves from sin and they washed their clothes; and Aaron presented them as a wave offering before the LORD, and Aaron made atonement for them to cleanse them. 22Then after that the Levites went in to perform their service in the Tent of Meeting before Aaron and his sons; just as the LORD had commanded Moses concerning the Levites, so they did to them.\n\nRetirement 23Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 24“This is what applies to the Levites: from twenty-five years old and upward they shall enter to perform service in the work of the Tent of Meeting, 25but at the age of fifty years, they shall retire from the service of the [tabernacle] work and serve no longer. 26They may assist their brothers in the Tent of Meeting to keep an obligation, but they shall do no [heavy or difficult] work. Thus you shall deal with the Levites concerning their obligations.”\n\nNumbers 9\nThe Passover\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses in the Wilderness of Sinai in the first month of the second year after they had come out of the land of Egypt, saying, 2“The sons of Israel are to keep the Passover at its appointed time. 3“On the fourteenth day of this month at twilight, you shall keep it at its appointed time; according to all its statutes and ordinances you shall keep it.” 4So Moses told the Israelites to observe the Passover. 5They observed the Passover on the fourteenth day of the first month at twilight in the Wilderness of Sinai; in accordance with all that the LORD had commanded Moses, so the Israelites did. 6But there were certain men who were [ceremonially] unclean because of [touching] the dead body of a man, so they could not observe the Passover on that day; so they came before Moses and Aaron that same day. 7Those men said to Moses, “We are [ceremonially] unclean because of [touching] a dead body. Why are we being restrained from presenting the LORD’S offering at its appointed time among the Israelites?” 8Therefore, Moses said to them, “Wait, and I will listen to what the LORD will command concerning you.”\n\n9Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 10“Say to the Israelites, ‘If any one of you or of your descendants becomes [ceremonially] unclean because of [touching] a dead body or is on a distant journey, he may, however, observe the Passover to the LORD. 11‘On the fourteenth day of the second month [thirty days later] at twilight, they shall observe it; they shall eat it with unleavened bread and bitter herbs. 12‘They shall leave none of it until morning nor break any of its bones; in accordance with all the statutes of the Passover they shall observe it. 13‘But the man who is [ceremonially] clean and is not on a journey, and yet does not observe the Passover, that person shall be cut off from among his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them] because he did not bring the LORD’S offering at its appointed time; that man will bear [the penalty of] his sin. 14‘If a stranger lives among you as a resident alien and observes the Passover to the LORD, in accordance with its statutes and its ordinances, so shall he do; you shall have one statute, both for the resident alien and for the native of the land.’”\n\nThe Cloud on the Tabernacle 15Now on the day that the tabernacle was erected, the cloud [of God’s presence] covered the tabernacle, that is, the tent of the Testimony; and in the evening it was over the tabernacle, appearing like [a pillar of] fire until the morning. 16So it was continuously; the cloud covered it by day, and the appearance of fire by night. 17Whenever the cloud was lifted from over the tent (tabernacle), afterward the Israelites would set out; and in the place where the cloud stopped, there the Israelites would camp. 18At the LORD’S command the Israelites would journey on, and at His command they would camp. As long as the cloud remained over the tabernacle they remained camped. 19Even when the cloud lingered over the tabernacle for many days, the Israelites would keep their obligation to the LORD and not set out. 20Sometimes the cloud remained only a few days over the tabernacle, and in accordance with the command of the LORD they remained camped. Then at His command they set out. 21If sometimes the cloud remained [over the tabernacle] from evening only until morning, when the cloud was lifted in the morning, they would journey on; whether in the daytime or at night, whenever the cloud was lifted, they would set out. 22Whether it was two days or a month or a year that the cloud [of the LORD’S presence] lingered over the tabernacle, staying above it, the Israelites remained camped and did not set out; but when it was lifted, they set out. 23At the command of the LORD they camped, and at the command of the LORD they journeyed on; they kept their obligation to the LORD, in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses.\n\nNumbers 10\nThe Silver Trumpets\n\n1The LORD spoke further to Moses, saying, 2“Make two trumpets of silver; you shall make them of hammered work. You shall use them to summon the congregation and to have the camps move out. 3When both are blown, all the congregation [that is, all adult males] shall gather before you at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 4However, if a single trumpet is blown, then the leaders, heads of the tribes of Israel, shall gather themselves to you. 5When you blow an alarm, the camps on the east side [of the tabernacle] shall set out. 6When you blow an alarm the second time, then the camps on the south side [of the tabernacle] shall set out. They shall blow an alarm whenever they are to move out [on their journeys]. 7When the assembly is to be gathered, you shall blow [the trumpets in short, sharp tones], but without sounding an alarm. 8The sons of Aaron, the priests, shall blow the trumpets; and the trumpets shall be for you a perpetual statute throughout your generations. 9When you go to war in your land against the enemy that attacks you, then sound an alarm with the trumpets, so that you may be remembered before the LORD your God, and you shall be saved from your enemies. 10“Also in the day of rejoicing, and in your appointed feasts, and at the beginnings of your months, you shall sound the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifice of your peace offerings; and they shall be as a reminder of you before your God. I am the LORD your God.”\n\nThe Tribes Leave Sinai 11On the twentieth day of the second month in the second year [since leaving Egypt], the cloud [of the Lord’s presence] was lifted from over the tabernacle of the Testimony, 12and the Israelites set out on their journey from the Wilderness of Sinai, and the cloud [of the LORD’S guiding presence] settled down in the Wilderness of Paran. 13So they moved out for the first time in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses. 14The standard of the camp of the sons of Judah, according to their armies, moved out first, Nahshon the son of Amminadab was [commander] over its army, 15and Nethanel the son of Zuar was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Issachar; 16and Eliab the son of Helon was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Zebulun.\n\n17Then the tabernacle was taken down; and the sons of Gershon and the sons of Merari, who were carrying the tabernacle, moved out. 18Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Reuben, according to their armies, moved out, with Elizur the son of Shedeur [commander] over its army, 19and Shelumiel the son of Zurishaddai was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Simeon, 20and Eliasaph the son of Deuel was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Gad.\n\n21Then the Kohathites moved out, carrying the holy things, and the tabernacle was set up before they arrived. 22Next the standard of the camp of the sons of Ephraim moved out, according to their armies, with Elishama the son of Ammihud [commander] over its army, 23and Gamaliel the son of Pedahzur was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Manasseh, 24and Abidan the son of Gideoni was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Benjamin.\n\n25Then the standard of the camp of the sons of Dan, according to their armies, which formed the rear guard for all the camps, moved out, with Ahiezer the son of Ammishaddai [commander] over its army, 26and Pagiel the son of Ochran was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Asher, 27and Ahira the son of Enan was [commander] over the tribal army of the sons of Naphtali. 28This was the order of march of the sons of Israel by their armies as they moved out.\n\n29Then Moses said to Hobab the son of Reuel the Midianite, Moses’ father-in-law, “We are going to the place of which the LORD said, ‘I will give it to you.’ Come with us, and we will be good to you, for the LORD has promised good [things] concerning Israel.” 30But Hobab [Moses’ brother-in-law] said to him, “I will not go; I will return to my own land and to my family.” 31Then Moses said, “Please do not leave us, for you know how we are to camp in the wilderness, and you will serve as eyes for us [as we make our trek through the desert]. 32“So if you will go with us, it shall be that whatever good the LORD does for us, we will do the same for you.”\n\n33So they set out from the mountain of the LORD (Sinai) three days’ journey; and the ark of the covenant of the LORD went in front of them during the three days’ journey to seek out a resting place for them. 34The cloud of the LORD was over them by day when they set out from the camp.\n\n35Whenever the ark set out, Moses said,\n“Rise up, O LORD!\nLet Your enemies be scattered;\nAnd let those who hate You flee before You.”\n\n36And when the ark rested, Moses said,\n“Return, O LORD,\nTo the myriad (many) thousands of Israel.”\n\nNumbers 11\nThe People Complain\n\n1Now the people became like those who complain and whine about their hardships, and the LORD heard it; and when the LORD heard it, His anger was kindled, and the fire of the LORD burned among them and devoured those in the outlying parts of the camp. 2So the people cried out to Moses, and when Moses prayed to the LORD, the fire died out. 3He named that place Taberah (the place of burning), because the fire of the LORD burned among them.\n\n4The rabble among them [who followed Israel from Egypt] had greedy desires [for familiar and delicious food], and the Israelites wept again and said, “Who will give us meat to eat? 5We remember the fish we ate freely and without cost in Egypt, the cucumbers, melons, leeks, onions, and garlic. 6“But now our appetite is gone; there is nothing at all [in the way of food] to be seen but this manna.”\n\n7The manna was like coriander seed, and it looked like bdellium. 8The people went about and gathered it, and ground it in mills or beat it in mortars, and boiled it in pots, and made cakes with it; and it tasted like cakes baked with fresh [olive] oil. 9When the dew fell on the camp at night, the manna fell with it.\n\nThe Complaint of Moses 10Now Moses heard the people weeping [in self-pity] throughout their families, every man at the doorway of his tent; and the anger of the LORD blazed hotly, and Moses regarded their behavior as evil. 11So Moses said to the LORD, “Why have You been so hard on Your servant? And why have I not found favor in Your sight, that You have placed the burden of all these people on me? 12Was it I who conceived all these people? Was it I who brought them forth, that You should say to me, ‘Carry them in your arms as a nurse carries the nursing infant, to the land which You swore to their fathers’? 13Where am I to get meat to give to all these people? For they weep before me and say, ‘Give us meat, so that we may eat.’ 14I am not able to carry all these people alone, because the burden is too heavy for me. 15“So if this is the way You are going to deal with me, please kill me at once, if I have found favor in your sight, and do not let me see my wretchedness.”\n\nSeventy Elders to Assist 16Accordingly, the LORD said to Moses, “Gather for Me seventy men from among the elders of Israel whom you know to be the elders of the people and their officers; bring them to the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) and let them stand there with you. 17Then I will come down and speak with you there, and I will take away some of the Spirit who is upon you, and will put Him upon them; and they shall bear the burden of the people with you, so that you will not have to bear it all alone. 18“Say to the people, ‘Consecrate (separate as holy) yourselves for tomorrow, and you shall eat meat; for you have wept [in self-pity] in the ears of the LORD, saying, “Who will give us meat to eat? For we were well-off in Egypt.” Therefore the LORD will give you meat, and you shall eat. 19‘You shall eat, not one day, nor two days, nor five days, nor ten days, nor twenty days, 20but a whole month—until it comes out of your nostrils and is disgusting to you—because you have rejected and despised the LORD who is among you, and have wept [in self-pity] before Him, saying, “Why did we come out of Egypt?”’” 21But Moses said, “The people, among whom I am, are 600,000 [fighting men] on foot [besides all the women and children]; yet You have said, ‘I will give them meat, so that they may eat it for a whole month!’ 22“Should flocks and herds be slaughtered for them, to be sufficient for them? Or should all the fish of the sea be collected for them to be sufficient for them?” 23The LORD said to Moses, “Is the LORD’S hand (ability, power) limited (short, inadequate)? You shall see now whether My word will come to pass for you or not.”\n\n24So Moses went out and spoke to the people the words of the LORD, and he gathered seventy men from among the elders of the people and stationed them around the Tent (tabernacle). 25Then the LORD came down in the cloud and spoke to him; and He took some of the Spirit who was upon Moses and put Him upon the seventy elders. When the Spirit rested upon them, they prophesied [praising God and declaring His will], but they did not do it again.\n\n26But two men had remained in the camp; one named Eldad and the other named Medad. The Spirit rested upon them (now they were among those who had been registered, but had not gone out to the Tent), and they prophesied in the camp. 27So a young man ran and told Moses and said, “Eldad and Medad are prophesying [extolling the praises of God and declaring His will] in the camp.” 28Then Joshua the son of Nun, the attendant of Moses from his youth, said, “My lord Moses, stop them!” 29But Moses said to him, “Are you jealous for my sake? Would that all the LORD’S people were prophets and that the LORD would put His Spirit upon them!” 30Then Moses went back into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.\n\nThe Quail and the Plague 31Now there went forth a wind from the LORD and it brought quails from the sea, and let them fall [so they flew low] beside the camp, about a day’s journey on this side and on the other side, all around the camp, about two cubits (three feet) deep on the surface of the ground. 32The people spent all that day and all night and all the next day and caught and gathered the quail (the one who gathered least gathered ten homers) and they spread them out for themselves around the camp [to cure them by drying]. 33While the meat was still between their teeth, before it was chewed, the anger of the LORD was kindled against the people, and the LORD struck them with a very severe plague. 34So that place was named Kibroth-hattaavah (the graves of greediness), because there they buried the people who had been greedy [for more than the manna that God provided them]. 35From Kibroth-hattaavah the people set out for Hazeroth, and they remained at Hazeroth.\n\nNumbers 12\nThe Murmuring Of Miriam And Aaron\n\n1Now Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Cushite woman whom he had married (for he had married a Cushite woman); 2and they said, “Has the LORD really spoken only through Moses? Has He not spoken also through us?” And the LORD heard it. 3(Now the man Moses was very humble (gentle, kind, devoid of self-righteousness), more than any man who was on the face of the earth.) 4Suddenly the LORD said to Moses, Aaron, and Miriam, “Come out, you three, to the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle).” And the three of them came out. 5The LORD came down in a pillar of cloud and stood at the doorway of the tabernacle, and He called Aaron and Miriam, and they came forward. 6And He said,\n“Hear now My words:\nIf there is a prophet among you,\nI the LORD will make Myself known to him in a vision\nAnd I will speak to him in a dream.\n7“But it is not so with My servant Moses;\nHe is entrusted and faithful in all My house.\n8“With him I speak mouth to mouth [directly],\nClearly and openly and not in riddles;\nAnd he beholds the form of the LORD.\nWhy then were you not afraid to speak against My servant Moses?”\n\n9And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Miriam and Aaron, and He departed. 10But when the cloud had withdrawn from over the tent, behold, Miriam was leprous, as white as snow. And Aaron turned and looked at Miriam, and, behold, she was leprous. 11Then Aaron said to Moses, “Oh, my lord, I plead with you, do not account this sin to us, in which we have acted foolishly and in which we have sinned. 12“Oh, do not let her be like one dead, already half decomposed when he comes from his mother’s womb.” 13So Moses cried out to the LORD, saying, “Heal her please, O God, I plead with You!” 14But the LORD said to Moses, “If her father had but spit in her face, would she not bear her shame for seven days? Let her be shut up outside the camp for seven days, and afterward she may return.” 15So Miriam was shut up outside the camp for seven days, and the people did not move on until Miriam was brought in again [and declared ceremonially clean from her leprosy].\n\n16Afterward the people moved on from Hazeroth and camped in the Wilderness of Paran.\n\nNumbers 13\nSpies View The Land\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I am going to give to the sons of Israel. From each of their fathers’ tribes you shall send a man, every one a leader among them.” 3So Moses sent spies from the Wilderness of Paran at the command of the LORD, all of them men who were heads of the Israelites. 4These were their names: from the tribe of Reuben, Shammua the son of Zaccur; 5from the tribe of Simeon, Shaphat the son of Hori; 6from the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 7from the tribe of Issachar, Igal the son of Joseph; 8from the tribe of Ephraim, Hoshea [that is, Joshua] the son of Nun; 9from the tribe of Benjamin, Palti the son of Raphu; 10from the tribe of Zebulun, Gaddiel the son of Sodi; 11from the tribe of Joseph, that is, of the tribe of Manasseh, Gaddi the son of Susi; 12from the tribe of Dan, Ammiel the son of Gemalli; 13from the tribe of Asher, Sethur the son of Michael; 14from the tribe of Naphtali, Nahbi the son of Vophsi; 15from the tribe of Gad, Geuel the son of Machi. 16These are the names of the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land; but Moses called Hoshea the son of Nun, Joshua (the LORD is salvation).\n\n17Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said to them, “Go up this way into the Negev (the South country); then go up into the hill country. 18See what the land is like and whether the people who live there are strong or weak, few or many, 19and whether the land in which they live is good or bad, and whether the cities in which they live are [open] camps or fortifications, 20and what the land is, whether it is fat (productive) or lean, whether there is timber on it or not. Make an effort to get some of the fruit of the land.” Now the time was the time of the first ripe grapes.\n\n21So they went up and spied out the land from the Wilderness of Zin to Rehob [a town in Lebanon], at Lebo-hamath [in the far north]. 22When they had gone up into the Negev (the South country), they came to Hebron; and Ahiman, Sheshai, and Talmai the descendants of Anak were there. (Now Hebron was built seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)\n\n23Then they came to the Valley of Eshcol (cluster of grapes), and from there cut down a branch with a single cluster of grapes; and they carried it on a pole between two of them, with some of pomegranates and the figs. 24That place was called the Valley of Eshcol (cluster of grapes) because of the cluster of grapes which the sons of Israel cut down there.\n\nThe Spies’ Reports 25When they returned from spying out the land, at the end of forty days, 26they came to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation of the sons of Israel in the Wilderness of Paran at Kadesh, and brought back word to them and to all the congregation, and showed them the land’s fruit. 27They reported to Moses and said, “We went in to the land where you sent us; and it certainly does flow with milk and honey, and this is its fruit. 28But the people who live in the land are strong, and the cities are fortified (walled) and very large; moreover, we saw there the descendants of Anak [people of great stature and courage]. 29“[The people descended from] Amalek live in the land of the Negev (South country); the Hittite, the Jebusite, and the Amorite live in the hill country; and the Canaanites live by the [Dead] Sea and along the side of the Jordan.”\n\n30Then Caleb quieted the people before Moses, and said, “Let us go up at once and take possession of it; for we will certainly conquer it.” 31But the men who had gone up with him said, “We are not able to go up against the people [of Canaan], for they are too strong for us.” 32So they gave the Israelites a bad report about the land which they had spied out, saying, “The land through which we went, in spying it out, is a land that devours its inhabitants. And all the people that we saw in it are men of great stature. 33“There we saw the Nephilim (the sons of Anak are part of the Nephilim); and we were like grasshoppers in our own sight, and so we were in their sight.”\n\nNumbers 14\nThe People Rebel\n\n1Then all the congregation [of Israel] raised their voices and cried out, and the people wept that night. 2All the Israelites murmured [in discontent] against Moses and Aaron; and the whole congregation said to them, “Oh that we had died in the land of Egypt! Or that we had died in this wilderness! 3“Why is the LORD bringing us to this land [of Canaan], to fall by the sword? Our wives and children will become plunder. Would it not be better for us to return to Egypt?” 4So they said one to another, “Let us appoint a [new] leader and return to Egypt.”\n\n5Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of the congregation of the Israelites. 6Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, who were among those who had spied out the land, tore their clothes [as a sign of grief], 7and they spoke to all the congregation of the sons of Israel, saying, “The land through which we passed as spies is an exceedingly good land. 8If the LORD delights in us, then He will bring us into this land and give it to us, a land which flows with milk and honey. 9“Only do not rebel against the LORD; and do not fear the people of the land, for they will be our prey. Their protection has been removed from them, and the LORD is with us. Do not fear them.” 10But all the congregation said to stone Joshua and Caleb with stones. But the glory and brilliance of the LORD appeared at the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) before all the sons of Israel.\n\nMoses Pleads for the People 11The LORD said to Moses, “How long will these people treat me disrespectfully and reject Me? And how long will they not believe in Me, despite all the [miraculous] signs which I have performed among them? 12“I will strike them with the pestilence (plague) and dispossess them, and will make you into a nation greater and mightier than they.”\n\n13But Moses said to the LORD, “Then the Egyptians will hear of it, for by Your strength You brought up these people from among them, 14and they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land. They have heard that You, LORD, are among these people [of Israel], that You, LORD, are seen face to face, while Your cloud stands over them; and that You go before them in a pillar of cloud by day and in a pillar of fire by night. 15Now if You kill these people as one man, then the nations (Gentiles) that have heard of Your fame will say, 16‘Because the LORD was not able to bring these people into the land which He promised to give them, therefore He slaughtered them in the wilderness.’ 17But now, please, let the power of the Lord be great, just as You have declared, saying, 18‘The LORD is slow to anger, and abundant in lovingkindness, forgiving wickedness and transgression; but He will by no means clear the guilty, visiting (avenging) the wickedness and guilt of the fathers on the children, to the third and fourth generations [that is, calling the children to account for the sins of their fathers].’ 19“Please pardon the wickedness and guilt of these people according to the greatness of Your lovingkindness, just as You have forgiven these people, from Egypt even until now.”\n\nThe LORD Pardons and Rebukes 20So the LORD said, “I have pardoned them according to your word; 21but indeed as I live, all the earth will be filled with the glory of the LORD. 22Surely all the men who have seen My glory and My [miraculous] signs which I performed in Egypt and in the wilderness, yet have put Me to the test these ten times and have not listened to My voice, 23will by no means see the land which I swore to [give to] their fathers; nor will any who treated me disrespectfully and rejected Me see it. 24But My servant Caleb, because he has a different spirit and has followed Me fully, I will bring into the land into which he entered, and his descendants shall take possession of it. 25“Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites live in the valley; tomorrow turn and set out for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea.”\n\n26The LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 27“How long shall I put up with this evil congregation who murmur [in discontent] against Me? I have heard the complaints of the Israelites, which they are making against Me. 28Say to them, ‘As I live,’ says the LORD, ‘just what you have spoken in My hearing I will most certainly do to you; 29your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness, even all who were numbered of you, your entire number from twenty years old and upward, who have murmured against Me. 30‘Except for Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun, not one of you shall enter the land in which I swore [an oath] to settle you. 31‘But your children whom you said would become plunder, I will bring in, and they will know the land which you have despised and rejected. 32‘But as for you, your dead bodies will fall in this wilderness. 33‘Your sons shall be wanderers and shepherds in the wilderness for forty years, and they will suffer for your unfaithfulness (spiritual infidelity), until your corpses are consumed in the wilderness. 34‘According to the number of days in which you spied out the land [of Canaan], forty days, for each day, you shall bear and suffer a year for your sins and guilt, for forty years, and you shall know My displeasure [the revoking of My promise and My estrangement because of your sin]. 35‘I, the LORD, have spoken. I will most certainly do this to all this evil congregation who are gathered together against Me. In this wilderness they shall be consumed [by war, disease, and plagues], and here they shall die.’”\n\n36As for the men whom Moses sent to spy out the land, and who returned and made all the congregation murmur and complain against him by bringing back a bad report concerning the land, 37even those [ten] men who brought back the very bad report of the land died by a plague before the LORD. 38But Joshua the son of Nun and Caleb the son of Jephunneh remained alive out of those men who went to spy out the land.\n\nIsrael Repulsed 39Moses spoke the Lord’s words to all the Israelites, and the people mourned greatly. 40They got up early in the morning and went up to the ridge of the hill country, saying, “Look, here we are; we have indeed sinned, but we will go up to the place which the LORD has promised.” 41But Moses said, “Why then are you transgressing the commandment of the LORD, when it will not succeed? 42Do not go up, or you will be struck down before your enemies, for the LORD is not among you. 43“For the Amalekites and the Canaanites will be there in front of you, and you will fall by the sword, because you have turned away from following the LORD; therefore the LORD will not be with you.” 44But [in their arrogance] they dared to go up to the ridge of the hill country; however, neither the ark of the covenant of the LORD nor Moses left the camp. 45Then the Amalekites and the Canaanites who lived in that hill country came down and struck the Israelites and scattered them as far as Hormah.\n\nNumbers 15\nLaws For Canaan\n\n1Now the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you come into the land where you are to live, which I am giving you, 3then make an offering by fire to the LORD, a burnt offering or a sacrifice to fulfill a special vow, or as a freewill offering or in your appointed feasts, to make a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD, from the herd or from the flock. 4‘The one who presents his offering shall present to the LORD a grain offering of a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a fourth of a hin of oil, 5and you shall prepare wine for the drink offering, a fourth of a hin, with the burnt offering or for the sacrifice, for each lamb. 6‘Or for a ram you shall prepare as a grain offering two-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with a third of a hin of oil. 7‘And for the drink offering you shall offer a third of a hin of wine, as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 8‘When you prepare a bull as a burnt offering or as a sacrifice, in fulfilling a special vow or peace offering to the LORD, 9then you shall offer with the bull a grain offering of three-tenths of an ephah of fine flour mixed with half a hin of oil; 10and you shall bring as the drink offering one-half a hin of wine as an offering by fire, as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD.\n\n11‘Thus shall it be done for each bull, or for each ram, or for each of the male lambs, or of the goats. 12‘According to the number that you prepare, so shall you do to everyone according to their number. 13‘All who are native-born shall do these things in this way, in presenting an offering by fire, as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. Law of the Stranger 14‘If a stranger lives as a resident alien with you, or whoever may be among you throughout your generations, and he wishes to make an offering by fire, as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD, just as you do, so shall he do. 15‘As for the assembly, there shall be one [and the same] statute for you [of the congregation] and for the stranger who is a resident alien with you, a permanent statute throughout your generations; as you are, so shall the stranger be before the LORD. 16‘There is to be one law and one ordinance for you and for the stranger who lives with you as a resident alien.’”\n\n17Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 18“Speak to the Israelites and say to them, ‘When you enter the land to which I am bringing you, 19then, when you eat the food of the land, you shall lift up an offering (heave offering) to the LORD. 20‘You shall lift up a cake made of the first of your [ground grain which has been made into] dough as an offering [to the Lord]; as an offering from the threshing floor, so shall you lift it up. 21‘From the first of your dough (ground grain) you shall give to the LORD an offering throughout your generations.\n\n22‘But when you unintentionally fail and do not observe all these commandments, which the LORD has spoken to Moses, 23even all that the LORD has commanded you through Moses, from the day that the LORD gave commandments and onward throughout your generations, 24then it shall be, if it was done unintentionally without the knowledge of the congregation, that all the congregation shall offer one young bull as a burnt offering, as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD, with its grain offering and its drink offering, according to the ordinance, and one male goat as a sin offering. 25‘Then the priest shall make atonement for all the congregation of the sons of Israel, and they will be forgiven, for it was an error and they have brought their offering, an offering by fire to the LORD, and their sin offering before the LORD, for their error. 26‘So all the congregation of the Israelites will be forgiven as well as the stranger who lives among them as a resident alien, because all the people were involved in the error.\n\n27‘Also if one person sins unintentionally, then he shall offer a female goat one year old as a sin offering. 28‘The priest shall make atonement before the LORD for the person who commits an error when he sins unintentionally, making atonement for him so that he may be forgiven. 29‘You shall have one law for him who sins unintentionally, whether he is native-born among the Israelites or a stranger who is living among them as a resident alien. 30‘But the person who does [anything wrong] willfully and defiantly, whether he is native-born or a stranger, that one is blaspheming the LORD, and that person shall be cut off from among his people [excluding him from the atonement made for them]. 31‘Because he has despised and rejected the word of the LORD, and has broken His commandment, that person shall be utterly cut off; [the responsibility for] his wickedness and guilt will be upon him.’”\n\nSabbath-breaking Punished 32Now while the Israelites were in the wilderness, they found a man who was gathering wood on the Sabbath day. 33Those who found him gathering wood brought him to Moses and Aaron and to all the congregation; 34and they put him in custody, because it had not been explained [by God] what should be done to him. 35Then the LORD said to Moses, “The man shall certainly be put to death. All the congregation shall stone him with stones outside the camp.” 36So all the congregation brought him outside the camp and stoned him to death with stones, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n37The LORD said to Moses, 38“Speak to the sons of Israel and tell them to make for themselves tassels on the hems of their garments throughout their generations, and put a cord of blue on the tassel of each hem. 39It shall be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the LORD, to do them, so that you do not follow after [the desires of] your own heart and eyes, [desires] after which you used to follow and play the prostitute, 40so that you may remember to do all My commandments and be holy (set apart) to your God. 41“I am the LORD your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt to be your God. I am the LORD your God.”\n\nNumbers 16\nKorah’s Rebellion\n\n1Now Korah the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi, with Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab, and On the son of Peleth, descendants of Reuben, took action, 2and they rose up [in rebellion] before Moses, together with some of the Israelites, two hundred and fifty leaders of the congregation chosen in the assembly, men of distinction. 3They assembled together against Moses and Aaron, and said to them, “You have gone far enough, for all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the LORD is among them. Why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the LORD?”\n\n4And when Moses heard this, he fell face downward; 5and he spoke to Korah and all his company, saying, “In the morning the LORD will show who belongs to Him, and who is holy, and will bring him near to Himself; the one whom He will choose He will bring near to Himself. 6Do this: Take censers for yourselves, Korah and all your company, 7then put fire in them and place incense on them in the presence of the LORD tomorrow; and the man whom the LORD chooses shall be the one who is holy. You have gone far enough, you sons of Levi.”\n\n8Then Moses said to Korah, “Hear now, you sons of Levi, 9does it seem but a small thing to you that the God of Israel has separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to Himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the LORD, and to stand before the congregation to minister to them; 10and that He has brought you near [to Him], Korah and all your brothers, sons of Levi with you? Would you seek the priesthood also? 11“Therefore you and all your company are gathered together against the LORD; but as for Aaron, who is he that you murmur against him?”\n\n12Then Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; but they said [defiantly], “We will not come up. 13Is it a small thing that you have brought us up out of a land [of plenty] flowing with milk and honey to kill us in the wilderness, but you would also lord it over us? 14“Indeed, you have not brought us into a land flowing with milk and honey, nor given us an inheritance of fields and vineyards. Will you gouge out the eyes of these men? We will not come up!”\n\n15Then Moses became very angry and said to the LORD, “Pay no attention to their offering! I have not taken one donkey from them, nor have I harmed any one of them.” 16Moses said to Korah, “You and all your company are to appear before the LORD tomorrow, both you and they along with Aaron. 17“Each of you take his censer and put incense on it, and each of you bring his censer before the LORD, two hundred and fifty censers; also you and Aaron shall each bring his censer.” 18So they each took his own censer and put fire on it and laid incense on it; and they stood at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), with Moses and Aaron. 19Then Korah assembled all the congregation against Moses and Aaron at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). And the glory and brilliance of the LORD appeared to all the congregation.\n\n20Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 21“Separate yourselves from among this congregation, so that I may consume them immediately.” 22But they fell on their faces [before the LORD], and said, “O God, God of the spirits of all flesh! When one man sins, will You be angry with the entire congregation?”\n\n23Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 24“Say to the congregation, ‘Get away from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.’”\n\n25Then Moses arose and went to Dathan and Abiram, and the elders of Israel followed him. 26And he said to the congregation, “Get away from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, or you will be swept away in all their sin.” 27So they got back from around the tents of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; and Dathan and Abiram came out and stood at the doorway of their tents with their wives and their sons and their little children. 28Then Moses said, “By this you shall know that the LORD has sent me to do all these works; for I do not act of my own accord. 29If these men die the common death of all mankind or if what happens to everyone happens to them, then [you will know for sure that] the LORD has not sent me. 30“But if the LORD creates an entirely new thing, and the ground opens its mouth and swallows them up, along with all that belongs to them, and they descend alive into Sheol (the nether world, the place of the dead), then you will understand that these men have spurned and rejected the LORD!”\n\n31As soon as Moses finished speaking all these words, the ground under them split open; 32and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them and their households, and all the men who supported Korah, with all their possessions. 33So they and all that belonged to them went down alive to Sheol; and the earth closed over them, and they perished from among the assembly. 34All Israel who were around them fled at their outcry, for they said, “The earth may swallow us also.” 35Fire also came forth from the LORD and consumed the two hundred and fifty men who were offering the incense.\n\n36Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 37“Tell Eleazar the son of Aaron, the priest, that he is to pick up the censers from the midst of the blaze for they are holy; and you scatter the burning coals abroad. 38“As for the censers of these people who have sinned at the cost of their lives, have the censers made into hammered sheets as a plating for the altar [of burnt offering], for they were presented before the LORD and they are sacred. They shall be a [warning] sign to the sons of Israel.” 39So Eleazar the priest took the bronze censers which the Levites who were burned had offered, and they were hammered out [into broad sheets] as a plating for the [bronze] altar [of burnt offering], 40as a reminder to the sons of Israel so that no layman—that is, one who is not of the descendants of Aaron should approach to offer incense before the LORD; so that he will not become like Korah and as his company—just as the LORD had said to him through Moses.\n\nMurmuring and Plague 41But on the next day the entire congregation of the Israelites murmured against Moses and Aaron, saying, “You have caused the death of the people of the LORD.” 42When the congregation was assembled against Moses and Aaron, they turned and looked at the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), and behold, the cloud covered it and the glory and brilliance of the LORD appeared. 43Then Moses and Aaron came to the front of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), 44and the LORD spoke to Moses saying, 45“Get away from among this congregation, so that I may consume them immediately.” Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces [in silence before the LORD]. 46Moses said to Aaron, “Take a censer and put fire in it from the altar and lay incense on it; then bring it quickly to the congregation and make atonement for them, for wrath has gone forth from the LORD; the plague has begun!” 47So Aaron took the burning censer as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the assembly; and behold, the plague had [already] begun among the people; and he put on the incense and made atonement for the people. 48He stood between the dead and the living, so that the plague was brought to an end. 49But those who died in the plague were 14,700, besides those who died because of Korah. 50Then Aaron returned to Moses at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), for the plague had been brought to an end.\n\nNumbers 17\nAaron’s Rod Buds\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Speak to the sons of Israel and get rods from them, a rod for each father’s household, from all their leaders according to their fathers’ households, twelve rods. Write every man’s name on his rod, 3and write Aaron’s name on the rod of Levi [his ancestor]; for there is one rod for the head of each of their fathers’ households. 4You shall then deposit them in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) in front of [the ark of] the Testimony, where I meet with you. 5“It shall be that the rod of the man whom I choose will bud, and I will no longer hear the constant grumblings of the Israelites, who are grumbling against you.” 6So Moses spoke to the Israelites, and each of their leaders gave him a rod, one for each leader according to their fathers’ households, twelve rods, and the rod of Aaron was among their rods. 7So Moses deposited the rods before the LORD in the Tent of the Testimony (tabernacle).\n\n8Now on the next day Moses went into the Tent of the Testimony, and the rod of Aaron of the tribe of Levi had sprouted and put out buds and produced blossoms and yielded [ripe] almonds. 9Moses brought out all the rods from the presence of LORD to all the Israelites; and they looked, and each man took his rod. 10But the LORD said to Moses, “Put Aaron’s rod back before the Testimony [in the ark], to be kept as a [warning] sign for the rebellious and contentious, so that you may put an end to their murmurings [of discontent] against Me, so that they do not die.” 11And Moses did so; just as the LORD had commanded him, so he did.\n\n12The sons of Israel said to Moses, “Look, we perish, we are doomed, all doomed! 13“Everyone who approaches, who approaches the tabernacle of the LORD, must die. Are we to perish completely?”\n\nNumbers 18\nDuties Of Levites\n\n1So the LORD said to Aaron, “You and your sons and your father’s household (family) with you shall bear the guilt in connection with the sanctuary [that is, through your service as priests you will atone for the offenses which the people unknowingly commit when brought into contact with the manifestations of God’s presence]; and you and your sons with you shall bear the guilt in connection with your priesthood [that is, your own unintentional offenses]. 2But bring with you also your brothers, the tribe of Levi, the tribe of your father (ancestor), so that they may join with you and serve you [as assistants], while you and your sons with you are before the Tent of the Testimony [the Holy Place where only priests may go, and the Most Holy Place which only the high priest may enter]. 3And the Levites shall attend to your duty [as assistants] and to the duties of all the tent (tabernacle); only they shall not approach the articles of the sanctuary and the altar, or both they and you will die. 4They shall join you and attend to the duties of the Tent of Meeting—all the service of the tent—and no stranger [no layman, anyone who is not a Levite] may approach you [and your sons]. 5So you shall attend to the duties of the sanctuary and the duties of the altar [of burnt offering and the altar of incense], so that there will no longer be wrath on the Israelites [as with Korah, Dathan, and Abiram]. 6Behold, I Myself have taken your fellow Levites from among the sons of Israel; they are a gift to you, given (dedicated) to the LORD, to do the service for the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 7“Therefore you and your sons with you shall attend to your priesthood for everything concerning the altar [of burnt offering and the altar of incense] and [of the Holy of Holies] within the veil, and you are to serve. I am giving you the priesthood as a bestowed service, but the stranger (outsider, layman) who approaches shall be put to death.”\n\nThe Priests’ Portion 8Then the LORD spoke to Aaron, “Now behold, I [the LORD] have entrusted you with My heave offerings, even all the holy gifts of the Israelites, I have given them to you as a portion, and to your sons as a continual allotment. 9This shall be yours of the most holy things, [reserved] from the fire: every offering of the people, every grain offering and sin offering and guilt offering, which they shall render (give) to Me, shall be most holy for you and for your sons. 10You shall eat it as the most holy thing; every male [of your family] shall eat it. It shall be holy to you. 11This also is yours: the heave offering of their gift, including all the wave offerings of the Israelites. I have given them to you and to your sons and to your daughters with you as a continual allotment; everyone in your household who is [ceremonially] clean may eat it. 12All the best of the fresh [olive] oil, and all the best of the new wine and of the grain, the first fruits of those which they give to the LORD, I give them to you. 13The first ripe fruits of all that is in the land, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; everyone in your household who is [ceremonially] clean may eat it. 14Every devoted thing in Israel [everything that has been promised to the Lord with an oath] shall be yours. 15Every firstborn of the womb of all flesh, whether it is man or animal, which they bring to the LORD, shall be yours; nevertheless, the firstborn of man you shall most certainly redeem, and the firstborn of unclean animals you shall redeem. 16And their redemption price, from a month old you shall redeem, according to your valuation, for the [fixed] price of five shekels in silver, in accordance with the shekel of the sanctuary, which is twenty gerahs. 17But the firstborn of a cow or of a sheep or of a goat you shall not redeem; they are holy [and belong to the LORD]. You shall sprinkle their blood on the altar and shall offer up their fat in smoke as an offering by fire, for a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD. 18Their meat shall be yours, like the breast of a wave offering and like the right thigh. 19“All the offerings of the holy things, which the Israelites offer to the LORD I have given to you and to your sons and your daughters with you as a continual allotment. It is an everlasting covenant of salt [that cannot be dissolved or violated] before the LORD to you and to your descendants with you.” 20Then the LORD said to Aaron, “You shall have no inheritance in the land [of the Israelites], nor have any portion [of land] among them. I am your portion and your inheritance among the children of Israel.\n\n21“Behold, I have given the Levites all the tithe in Israel as an inheritance, in return for their service which they perform, the service of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 22The Israelites shall never again approach the Tent of Meeting [the covered sanctuary, the Holy Place, and the Holy of Holies], or they [who do] will incur sin and die. 23Only the Levites shall perform the service of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), and they shall bear their iniquity; it shall be a statute forever throughout your generations, that the Levites shall have no inheritance [of land] among the children of Israel. 24“But the tithe of the Israelites, which they present as an offering to the LORD, I have given to the Levites as an inheritance; therefore I have said to them, ‘They shall have no inheritance among the children of Israel.’”\n\n25Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 26“Moreover, you shall speak to the Levites and say to them, ‘When you take from the Israelites the tithe which I have given to you from them as your inheritance, then you shall present an offering from it to the LORD, a tithe of the tithe [paid by the people]. 27‘Your offering shall be credited to you as the grain from the threshing floor or as the full produce from the wine vat. 28‘Likewise you shall also present an offering to the LORD from all your tithes, which you receive from the Israelites; and from it you shall give the LORD’S offering to Aaron the priest. 29‘Out of all your gifts, you shall present every offering due to the LORD, from all the best of it, even the sacred part from them.’ 30Therefore you shall say to them, ‘When you have offered the best from it, then the rest shall be credited to the Levites as the product of the threshing floor, and as the product of the wine vat. 31‘You may eat it anywhere, you and [the members of] your households, for it is your compensation in return for your service in the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 32‘You will bear no sin because of it when you have offered the best of it; but you shall not profane the sacred gifts of the children of Israel, or you will die [because of it].’”\n\nNumbers 19\nOrdinance Of The Red Heifer\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron, saying, 2“This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded: ‘Tell the Israelites to bring you an unblemished red heifer in which there is no defect and on which a yoke has never been placed. 3‘You shall give it to Eleazar the priest, and it shall be brought outside the camp and be slaughtered in his presence. 4‘Next Eleazar the priest shall take some of its blood with his finger and sprinkle some of it toward the front of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) seven times. 5‘Then the heifer shall be burned in his sight; its skin, its flesh, its blood, and its waste, shall be burned (reduced to ash). 6‘The priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet [material] and cast them into the midst of the burning heifer. 7‘Then the priest shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water; and afterward come into the camp, but he shall be [ceremonially] unclean until evening. 8‘The one who burns the heifer shall wash his clothes and bathe his body in water, and shall be unclean until evening. 9‘Now a man who is [ceremonially] clean shall collect the ashes of the heifer and deposit them outside the camp in a clean place, and the congregation of the Israelites shall keep it for water to remove impurity; it is [to be used for] purification from sin. 10‘The one who gathers the ashes of the heifer shall wash his clothes, and be unclean until evening. This shall be a perpetual statute to the Israelites and to the stranger who lives as a resident alien among them.\n\n11‘The one who touches the dead body of any person shall be unclean for seven days. 12‘That one shall purify himself from uncleanness with the water [made with the ashes of the burned heifer] on the third day and on the seventh day, and then he will be clean; but if he does not purify himself on the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean. 13‘Whoever touches a corpse, the body of anyone who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of the LORD; and that person shall be cut off from Israel [that is, excluded from the atonement made for them]. Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled on him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him.\n\n14‘This is the law when a man dies in a tent: everyone who comes into the tent and everyone who is in the tent shall be [ceremonially] unclean for seven days. 15‘Every open container [in the tent], which has no covering tied down on it, is unclean. 16‘Also, anyone in the open field who touches one who has been killed with a sword or who has died [of natural causes], or a human bone or a grave, shall be unclean for seven days. 17‘Then for the unclean person they shall take some of the ashes of the heifer burnt for the purification from sin, and running water shall be added to them in a container. 18‘A clean person shall take hyssop and dip it in the water and sprinkle it on the tent and on all the furnishings and on the people who were there, and on the one who touched the bone or the one who was killed or the one who died [naturally] or the grave. 19‘Then the clean person shall sprinkle [the water for purification] on the unclean person on the third day and on the seventh day, and on the seventh day the unclean man shall purify himself, and wash his clothes and bathe himself in water, and shall be [ceremonially] clean at evening.\n\n20‘But the man who is unclean and does not purify himself, that person shall be cut off from among the assembly, because he has defiled the sanctuary of the LORD. The water for purification has not been sprinkled on him; he is unclean. 21‘So it shall be a perpetual statute to them. He who sprinkles the water for impurity [on another] shall wash his clothes, and he who touches the water for impurity shall be unclean until evening. 22‘Furthermore, anything the unclean person touches shall be unclean, and anyone who touches it shall be [ceremonially] unclean until evening.’”\n\nNumbers 20\nDeath Of Miriam\n\n1Then the Israelites, the whole congregation, came into the Wilderness of Zin in the first month [in the fortieth year after leaving Egypt]. And the people lived in Kadesh. Miriam died there and was buried there.\n\n2Now there was no water for the congregation, and they gathered together against Moses and Aaron. 3The people contended with Moses, and said, “If only we had perished when our brothers perished [in the plague] before the LORD! 4Why have you brought up the assembly of the LORD into this wilderness to die here, we and our livestock? 5“Why have you made us come up from Egypt, to bring us to this wretched place? It is not a place of grain or of figs or of vines or of pomegranates, and there is no water to drink.” 6Then Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly to the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) and fell on their faces [before the LORD in prayer]. Then the glory and brilliance of the LORD appeared to them; 7and the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, The Water of Meribah 8“Take the rod; and you and your brother Aaron assemble the congregation and speak to the rock in front of them, so that it will pour out its water. In this way you shall bring water for them out of the rock and let the congregation and their livestock drink [fresh water].”\n\n9So Moses took the rod from before the LORD, just as He had commanded him; 10and Moses and Aaron gathered the assembly before the rock. Moses said to them, “Listen now, you rebels; must we bring you water out of this rock?” 11Then Moses raised his hand [in anger] and with his rod he struck the rock twice [instead of speaking to the rock as the LORD had commanded]. And the water poured out abundantly, and the congregation and their livestock drank [fresh water]. 12But the LORD said to Moses and Aaron, “Because you have not believed (trusted) Me, to treat Me as holy in the sight of the sons of Israel, you therefore shall not bring this assembly into the land which I have given them.” 13These are the waters of Meribah (contention, strife), where the sons of Israel contended with the LORD, and He showed Himself holy among them.\n\n14Moses sent messengers from Kadesh to the king of Edom: “Thus says your brother Israel, ‘You know all the hardship that has come upon us [as a nation]; 15that our fathers (ancestors) went down to Egypt, and we lived there for a long time, and the Egyptians treated [both] us and our fathers badly. 16‘But when we cried out to the LORD [for help], He heard us and sent an angel and brought us out of Egypt. Now look, we are in Kadesh, a city on the edge of your territory. 17‘Please let us pass through your land. We will not pass through a field or through a vineyard; we will not even drink water from a well. We will go along the king’s highway, not turning [off-course] to the right or to the left until we have passed through your territory.’”\n\n18But [the king of] Edom said to him, “You shall not pass through my territory, or I will come out against you with the sword.” 19Again, the Israelites said to him, “We will go by the highway [trade route], and if I and my livestock drink any of your water, then I will pay for it. Only let me pass through on foot, nothing else.” 20But the king of Edom said, “You shall not pass through [my territory].” And Edom came out against Israel with many people and a strong hand. 21Thus [the king of] Edom refused to give Israel passage through his territory, so Israel turned away from him.\n\n22Now when they set out from Kadesh, the Israelites, the whole congregation, came to Mount Hor. Death of Aaron 23Then the LORD spoke to Moses and Aaron at Mount Hor, by the border of the land of Edom, saying, 24“Aaron will be gathered to his people [in death]; for he shall not enter the land which I have given to the children of Israel, because you [both] rebelled against My command at the waters of Meribah. 25Take Aaron and Eleazar his son and bring them up to Mount Hor; 26and strip Aaron of his garments and put them on Eleazar his son. So Aaron will be gathered to his fathers, and will die there.” 27So Moses did just as the LORD had commanded; and they went up Mount Hor in the sight of all the congregation. 28After Moses stripped Aaron of his [priestly] garments and put them on Eleazar his son, Aaron died there on the mountain top. Then Moses and Eleazar came down from the mountain. 29When all the congregation saw that Aaron had died, all the house of Israel wept (mourned) for him thirty days.\n\nNumbers 21\nArad Conquered\n\n1When the Canaanite, the king of Arad, who lived in the Negev (the South country) heard that Israel was coming by the way of Atharim [the route traveled by the spies sent out by Moses], he fought against Israel and took some of them captive. 2So Israel made a vow to the LORD, and said, “If You will indeed hand over these people to me, then I will utterly destroy their cities.” 3The LORD heard the voice of Israel and handed over the Canaanites; then they utterly destroyed them and their cities. So the name of the place was called Hormah (dedicate to destruction).\n\n4Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the [branch of the] Red Sea [called the Gulf of Aqabah], to go around the land of Edom; and the people became impatient, because [of the challenges] of the journey. 5So the people spoke against God and against Moses, “Why have you brought us out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? For there is no bread, nor is there any water, and we loathe this miserable food.” The Bronze Serpent 6Then the LORD sent fiery (burning) serpents among the people; and they bit the people, and many Israelites died. 7So the people came to Moses, and said, “We have sinned, for we have spoken against the LORD and against you; pray to the LORD, so that He will remove the serpents from us.” So Moses prayed for the people. 8Then the LORD said to Moses, “Make a fiery serpent [of bronze] and set it on a pole; and everyone who is bitten will live when he looks at it.” 9So Moses made a serpent of bronze and put it on the pole, and it happened that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he looked to the bronze serpent, he lived.\n\n10Now the sons of Israel moved out and camped at Oboth. 11They journeyed on from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, in the wilderness facing Moab, toward the sunrise. 12From there they set out and camped in the Wadi Zered. 13From there they journeyed on and camped on the other side of [the river] Arnon, which is in the wilderness that extends from the boundary of the Amorites; for [the river] Arnon is the boundary of Moab, between Moab and the Amorites. 14That is why it is said in the Book of the Wars of the LORD:\n“Waheb in Suphah,\nAnd the wadis of the Arnon [River],\n15And the slope of the wadis\nThat stretches toward the site of Ar\nAnd leans to the border of Moab.”\n\n16From there the Israelites went on to Beer, that is the well where the LORD said to Moses, “Gather the people together and I will give them water.”\n\n17Then Israel sang this song,\n“Spring up, O well! Sing to it,\n18The well which the leaders dug,\nWhich the nobles of the people hollowed out\nWith the scepter and with their staffs.”\nAnd from the wilderness Israel journeyed to Mattanah, 19and from Mattanah to Nahaliel, and from Nahaliel to Bamoth, 20and from Bamoth to the valley that is in the field of Moab, to the top of Pisgah which looks down on the wasteland.\n\nTwo Victories 21Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon, king of the Amorites, saying, 22“Let me pass through your land; we will not turn away [from the road] into field or vineyard; we will not drink the water of the wells. We will go by the king’s highway until we have crossed your border.” 23But Sihon would not allow Israel to pass through his border. Instead Sihon gathered all his people together and went out against Israel into the wilderness, and came to Jahaz, and he fought against Israel. 24Then Israel struck the king of the Amorites with the edge of the sword and took possession of his land from the Arnon to the Jabbok, as far as the Ammonites, for the boundary of the Ammonites was strong. 25Israel took all these cities, and settled in all the cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon and in all its towns. 26For Heshbon was the city of Sihon, king of the Amorites, who had fought against the former king of Moab and had taken all his land out of his hand, as far as the Arnon. 27That is why those who use proverbs say,\n“Come to Heshbon,\nLet the city of Sihon be built and established.\n28“For fire has gone out of Heshbon,\nA flame from the city of Sihon;\nIt devoured Ar of Moab\nAnd the lords of the heights of the Arnon.\n29“Woe (judgment is coming) to you, Moab!\nYou are destroyed, O people of [the god] Chemosh!\nMoab has given his sons as fugitives [that is, survivors of battle],\nAnd his daughters into captivity\nTo Sihon king of the Amorites.\n30“We have shot them down [with arrows];\nHeshbon is destroyed as far as Dibon,\nAnd we have laid them waste as far as Nophah,\nWhich reaches to Medeba.”\n\n31Thus Israel settled in the land of the Amorites. 32Now Moses sent men to spy out Jazer, and they overthrew its villages and dispossessed the Amorites who were there.\n\n33Then they turned and went up by the way of Bashan; and Og the king of Bashan went out against them, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei. 34But the LORD said to Moses, “Do not fear him, for I have handed over him and all his people and his land to you; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.” 35So the sons of Israel killed Og and his sons and all his people, until there was no survivor left to him; and they took possession of his land.\n\nNumbers 22\nBalak Sends For Balaam\n\n1The Israelites journeyed, and camped in the plains of Moab, on the east side of the Jordan [River] across from Jericho.\n\n2And Balak [the king of Moab] the son of Zippor saw all that Israel had done to the Amorites. 3So Moab was terrified because of the people, for they were numerous. Moab was overcome with fear because of the sons of Israel. 4Moab said to the elders of Midian, “Now this horde will lick up all that is around us, just as the ox licks up the grass of the field.” And Balak the son of Zippor was the king of Moab at that time. 5So he sent messengers to Balaam [a famous prophet-diviner] the son of Beor at Pethor, which is by the [Euphrates] River, in the land of the descendants of his people, to call for him, saying, “There is a people who have come out of Egypt; behold, they cover the surface of the land, and they are living opposite me. 6“Now please come, curse these people for me, for they are too powerful for me; perhaps I will be able to defeat them and drive them out of the land. For I know [your reputation] that he whom you bless is blessed, and he whom you curse is cursed.”\n\n7So the elders of Moab and of Midian departed with fees for divination (foretelling) in hand; and they came to Balaam and told him the words of Balak. 8Balaam said to them, “Spend the night here and I will bring word back to you as the LORD may speak to me.” So the leaders of Moab stayed with Balaam [that night]. 9God came to Balaam, and said, “Who are these men with you?” 10Balaam said to God, “Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, has sent word to me: 11‘Hear this, the people who came out of Egypt cover the surface of the land; come now, curse them for me. Perhaps I may be able to fight against them and drive them out.’” 12God said to Balaam, “Do not go with them; you shall not curse the people [of Israel], for they are blessed.” 13Balaam got up in the morning, and said to the leaders of Balak, “Go back to your own land [of Moab], for the LORD has refused to let me go with you.” 14The leaders of Moab arose and went to Balak, and said, “Balaam refused to come with us.”\n\n15Then Balak again sent leaders, more numerous and [men who were] more distinguished than the first ones. 16They came to Balaam, and said to him, “Thus says Balak the son of Zippor, ‘I beg you, let nothing hinder you from coming to me. 17‘For I will give you a very great honor and I will do whatever you tell me; so please come, curse these people [of Israel] for me.’” 18Balaam answered the servants of Balak, “Even if Balak were to give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not do anything, either small or great, contrary to the command of the LORD my God. 19“Now please, you also stay here tonight, and I will find out what else the LORD will say to me.” 20God came to Balaam at night and said to him, “If the men have come to call you, get up and go with them, but you shall still do only what I tell you.”\n\n21So Balaam got up in the morning and saddled his donkey and went with the leaders of Moab. The Angel and Balaam 22But God’s anger was kindled because he was going, and the Angel of the LORD took His stand in the way as an adversary against him. Now he was riding on his donkey, and his two servants were with him. 23When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way and His drawn sword in His hand, the donkey turned off the path and went into the field; but Balaam struck the donkey to turn her back toward the path. 24But the Angel of the LORD stood in a narrow path of the vineyards, with a [stone] wall on this side and a [stone] wall on that side. 25When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she pressed herself against the wall and crushed Balaam’s foot against it, and he struck her again. 26The Angel of the LORD went further, and stood in a narrow place where there was no room to turn, either to the right or to the left. 27When the donkey saw the Angel of the LORD, she lay down under Balaam, so Balaam was angry and he struck the donkey [a third time] with his staff. 28And the LORD opened the mouth of the donkey, and she said to Balaam, “What have I done to you that you have struck me these three times?” 29Then Balaam said to the donkey, “Because you have made a mockery of me! If there had been a sword in my hand, I would have killed you by now!” 30The donkey said to Balaam, “Am I not your donkey on which you have ridden all your life until this day? Have I ever been accustomed to do so to you?” And he said, “No.”\n\n31Then the LORD opened Balaam’s eyes, and he saw the Angel of the LORD standing in the way with His drawn sword in His hand; and he bowed his head and lay himself face down. 32The Angel of the LORD said to him, “Why have you struck your donkey these three times? Behold, I have come out to stand against you, because your behavior was obstinate and contrary to Me. 33“The donkey saw Me and turned away from Me these three times. If she had not turned away from Me, I would have certainly killed you now, and let her live.” 34Balaam said to the Angel of the LORD, “I have sinned, for I did not know that You were standing in the way against me. But now, if my going displeases You, I will turn back.” 35The Angel of the LORD said to Balaam, “Go with the men, but you shall speak only what I tell you.” So Balaam went along with the leaders of Balak.\n\n36When Balak heard that Balaam was coming, he went out to meet him at the city of Moab, which is on the border at the Arnon [River], at the farthest end of the border. 37Balak said to Balaam, “Did I not urgently send word to you to call you? Why did you not come to me [immediately]? Am I really unable to honor (pay) you?” 38So Balaam said to Balak, “Indeed I have come to you now, but am I able to say anything at all? The word that God puts in my mouth, that I shall speak.” 39And Balaam went with Balak, and they came to Kiriath-huzoth. 40Balak sacrificed oxen and sheep, and sent some to Balaam and to the leaders who were with him.\n\n41Then it came about in the morning that Balak took Balaam and brought him up to the high places of Baal; from there he saw a portion of the Israelites.\n\nNumbers 23\nThe Prophecies Of Balaam\n\n1Then Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams here.” 2Balak did just as Balaam had said, and Balak and Balaam offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 3Then Balaam said to Balak, “Stand beside your burnt offering and I will go. Perhaps the LORD will come to meet me; and whatever He shows me I will tell you.” So he went to a desolate hill.\n\n4Now God met Balaam, who said to Him, “I have prepared seven altars, and I have offered a bull and a ram on each altar.” 5Then the LORD put a speech in Balaam’s mouth, and said, “Return to Balak, and you shall speak thus.” 6Balaam returned to Balak, and behold, he was standing by his burnt sacrifice, he and all the leaders of Moab. 7Balaam took up his [first] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“Balak, the king of Moab, has brought me from Aram (Syria),\nfrom the mountains of the east, [saying,]\n‘Come, curse [the descendants of] Jacob for me;\nAnd come, [violently] denounce Israel.’\n8“How shall I curse those whom God has not cursed?\nOr how can I [violently] denounce those the LORD has not denounced?\n9“For from the top of the rocks I see Israel,\nAnd from the hills I look at him.\nBehold, the people [of Israel] shall dwell alone\nAnd will not be reckoned among the nations.\n10“Who can count the dust (the descendants) of Jacob\nAnd the number of even the fourth part of Israel?\nLet me die the death of the righteous [those who are upright and in right standing with God],\nAnd let my end be like his!”\n\n11Then Balak said to Balaam, “What have you done to me? I brought you to curse my enemies, but here you have [thoroughly] blessed them instead!” 12Balaam answered, “Must I not be obedient and careful to speak what the LORD has put in my mouth?”\n\n13Balak said to him, “Come with me, I implore you, to another place from where you can see them, although you will see only the nearest and not all of them; and curse them for me from there.” 14So he took Balaam to the field of Zophim to the top of [Mount] Pisgah, and built seven altars, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar. 15Balaam said to Balak, “Stand here beside your burnt offering while I go to meet the LORD over there.” 16Then the LORD met Balaam and put a speech in his mouth, and said, “Go back to Balak and you shall speak thus.” 17When Balaam returned to Balak, he was standing beside his burnt offering, and the leaders of Moab were with him. And Balak said to him, “What has the LORD spoken?” 18Balaam took up his [second] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“Rise up, O Balak, and hear;\nListen [closely] to me, son of Zippor.\n19“God is not a man, that He should lie,\nNor a son of man, that He should repent.\nHas He said, and will He not do it?\nOr has He spoken and will He not make it good and fulfill it?\n20“Behold, I have received His command to bless [Israel].\nHe has blessed, and I cannot reverse it.\n21“God has not observed wickedness in Jacob [for he is forgiven],\nNor has He seen trouble in Israel.\nThe LORD their God is with Israel,\nAnd the shout of their King is among the people.\n22“God brought them out of Egypt;\nThey have the strength of a wild ox.\n23“For there is no enchantment or omen against Jacob,\nNor is there any divination against Israel.\nAt the proper time it shall be said to Jacob\nAnd to Israel, what has God done!\n24“Behold, a people rises up like a lioness\nAnd lifts itself up like a lion;\nHe will not lie down until he devours the prey\nAnd drinks the blood of the slain.”\n\n25Then Balak said to Balaam, “Neither curse them at all nor bless them at all!” 26But Balaam answered Balak, “Did I not say to you, ‘All that the LORD speaks, that I must do?’”\n\n27Then Balak said to Balaam, “Please come; I will take you to another place. Perhaps it will please God to let you curse them for me from there.” 28So Balak brought Balaam to the top of [Mount] Peor, that overlooks the wasteland. 29And Balaam said to Balak, “Build seven altars for me here, and prepare for me seven bulls and seven rams here.” 30Balak did just as Balaam had said, and offered a bull and a ram on each altar.\n\nNumbers 24\nThe Prophecy From Peor\n\n1When Balaam saw that it pleased the LORD to bless Israel, he did not go as he had done each time before [superstitiously] to seek omens and signs [in the natural world], but he set his face toward the wilderness (desert). 2And Balaam raised his eyes and he saw Israel living in their tents tribe by tribe; and the Spirit of God came on him. 3He took up his [third] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,\nAnd the oracle of the man whose eye is opened [at last, to see clearly the purpose and will of God],\n4The oracle of one who hears the words of God,\nWho sees the vision of the Almighty,\nFalling down, but having his eyes open and uncovered,\n5How fair are your tents, O Jacob,\nAnd your tabernacles, O Israel!\n6“Like valleys that stretch out,\nLike gardens beside the river,\nLike aloes planted by the LORD,\nLike cedars beside the waters.\n7“Water [that is, great blessings] will flow from his buckets,\nAnd his offspring will live by many waters,\nAnd his king will be higher than Agag,\nAnd his kingdom shall be exalted.\n8“God brought Israel out of Egypt;\nIsrael has strength like the wild ox;\nHe will devour [Gentile] nations, his adversaries (enemies),\nAnd will crush their bones in pieces,\nAnd shatter them with his arrows.\n9“He bowed down [to rest], he lies down as a lion;\nAnd as a lioness, who dares to rouse him?\nBlessed [of God] is he who blesses you,\nAnd cursed [of God] is he who curses you.”\n\n10Then Balak’s anger was kindled against Balaam, and he struck his hands together; and Balak said to Balaam, “I called you to curse my enemies, but behold, you have done nothing but bless them these three times. 11“Therefore now flee to your place! I had intended to honor you greatly, but behold, the LORD has held you back from honor.” 12Balaam said to Balak, “Did I not tell your messengers whom you had sent to me, 13‘Even if Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I could not go beyond the command of the LORD, to do either good or bad of my own accord. What the LORD speaks, that I will speak?’ 14“And now, look, I am going to my people; come, I will advise you as to what this people [Israel] will do to your people [Moab] in the days to come.”\n\n15He took up his [fourth] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“The oracle of Balaam the son of Beor,\nThe oracle of the man whose eye is opened,\n16The oracle of him who hears the words of God\nAnd knows the knowledge of the Most High,\nWho sees the vision of the Almighty,\nFalling down, but having his eyes open and uncovered:\n17“I see Him, but not now;\nI behold Him, but not near.\nA star shall come forth from [the descendants of] Jacob,\nA scepter shall rise out of [the descendants of] Israel\nAnd shall crush the forehead of Moab\nAnd destroy all the sons of Sheth.\n18“Edom shall be [taken as] a possession,\n[Mount] Seir, Israel’s enemies, also will be a possession,\nWhile Israel performs valiantly.\n19“One from [the descendants of] Jacob shall have dominion\nAnd will destroy the remnant from the city.”\n\n20Balaam looked at Amalek and took up his [fifth] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“Amalek was the first of the [neighboring] nations [to oppose the Israelites after they left Egypt],\nBut his end shall be destruction.”\n\n21And Balaam looked at the Kenites and took up his [sixth] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“Strong is your dwelling place,\nAnd you set your nest in the cliff.\n22“Nevertheless the Kenites will be consumed.\nHow long will Asshur (Assyria) keep you (Israel) captive?”\n\n23Then he took up his [seventh] discourse (oracle) and said:\n“Alas, who can live unless God has ordained it?\n24“But ships shall come from the coast of Kittim,\nAnd shall afflict Asshur (Assyria) and Eber;\nSo they (the victors) also will come to destruction.”\n\n25Then Balaam arose and departed and returned to his place, and Balak also went on his way.\n\nNumbers 25\nThe Sin Of Peor\n\n1Israel settled and remained in Shittim, and the people began to play the prostitute with the women of Moab [by being unfaithful to God]. 2For they invited the Israelites to the sacrifices of their gods, and the Israelites ate [food offered to idols] and bowed down to Moab’s gods. 3So Israel joined themselves to Baal of Peor [in worship]. And the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel. 4The LORD said to Moses, “Take all the leaders of the people [who have committed sin with the Moabites], and execute them in broad daylight before the LORD, so that the fierce anger of the LORD may turn away from Israel.” 5So Moses said to the judges of Israel, “Each one of you must kill his men who have joined themselves to Baal of Peor [in worship].”\n\n6Then one of the Israelites came and presented to his relatives a Midianite woman, in the sight of Moses and the whole congregation of the Israelites, while they were weeping [over God’s judgment] at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 7When Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, saw this, he left the congregation and took a spear in his hand, 8and he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and pierced both of them through the body, the man of Israel and the woman. Then the plague on the Israelites stopped. 9Nevertheless, those [Israelites] who died in the plague numbered 24,000.\n\nThe Zeal of Phinehas 10Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 11“Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, has turned my wrath away from the Israelites because he was jealous with My jealousy among them, so that I did not destroy the Israelites in My jealousy. 12Therefore say, ‘Behold, I give to Phinehas My covenant of peace. 13‘And it shall be for him and his descendants after him, a covenant of an everlasting priesthood, because he was jealous (impassioned) for [the unique honor and respect owed to] his God and made atonement for the sons of Israel.’”\n\n14Now the name of the man of Israel who was killed with the Midianite woman was Zimri the son of Salu, a leader of a father’s household among the Simeonites. 15The name of the Midianite woman who was killed was Cozbi the daughter of Zur, who was the tribal head of a father’s household in Midian.\n\n16Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 17“Provoke hostilities with the Midianites and attack them, 18for they harass you with their tricks, the tricks with which they have deceived you in the matter [of the Baal] of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of the leader of Midian, their sister, who was killed on the day of the plague because [of the Baal] of Peor.”\n\nNumbers 26\nCensus Of A New Generation\n\n1Then it happened after the plague that the LORD said to Moses and Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, 2“Take a census of all the [males in the] congregation of the sons of Israel from twenty years old and upward, by their fathers’ households, all in Israel who are able to go to war.” 3So Moses and Eleazar the priest spoke with the people in the plains of Moab by the Jordan at Jericho, saying, 4“A census of the people shall be taken from twenty years old and upward, just as the LORD has commanded Moses.”\n\nNow the Israelites who came out of the land of Egypt were:\n\n5Reuben, the firstborn of Israel (Jacob), the sons of Reuben: of Hanoch, the family of the Hanochites; of Pallu, the family of the Palluites; 6of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Carmi, the family of the Carmites. 7These are the families (clans) of the Reubenites; and those who were numbered of them were 43,730. 8The son of Pallu: Eliab. 9The sons of Eliab: Nemuel and Dathan and Abiram. These are the Dathan and Abiram who were called by the congregation, who contended against Moses and Aaron in the company of Korah, when they contended against the LORD, 10and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them up along with Korah, when that company died, when the fire devoured two hundred and fifty men, so that they became a [warning] sign. 11But Korah’s sons did not die [because they did not participate in the rebellion].\n\n12The sons of Simeon according to their families: of Nemuel, the family of the Nemuelites; of Jamin, the family of the Jaminites; of Jachin, the family of the Jachinites; 13of Zerah, the family of the Zerahites; of Shaul, the family of the Shaulites. 14These are the families (clans) of the Simeonites, 22,200.\n\n15The sons of Gad according to their families: of Zephon, the family of the Zephonites; of Haggi, the family of the Haggites; of Shuni, the family of the Shunites; 16of Ozni, the family of the Oznites; of Eri, the family of the Erites; 17of Arod, the family of the Arodites; of Areli, the family of the Arelites. 18These are the families (clans) of the sons of Gad according to those who were numbered, 40,500.\n\n19The sons of Judah were Er and Onan, but Er and Onan [were judged by God and] died in the land of Canaan. 20The sons of Judah according to their families: of Shelah, the family of the Shelanites; of Perez, the family of the Perezites; of Zerah, the family of the Zerahites. 21The sons of Perez: of Hezron, the family of the Hezronites; of Hamul, the family of the Hamulites. 22These are the families (clans) of Judah according to those who were numbered, 76,500.\n\n23The sons of Issachar according to their families: of Tola, the family of the Tolaites; of Puvah, the family of the Punites; 24of Jashub, the family of the Jashubites; of Shimron, the family of the Shimronites. 25These are the families (clans) of Issachar according to those who were numbered, 64,300.\n\n26The sons of Zebulun according to their families: of Sered, the family of the Seredites; of Elon, the family of the Elonites; of Jahleel, the family of the Jahleelites. 27These are the families (clans) of the Zebulunites according to those who were numbered, 60,500.\n\n28The sons of Joseph according to their families were Manasseh and Ephraim. 29The sons of Manasseh: of Machir, the family of the Machirites; and Machir was the father of Gilead; of Gilead, the family of the Gileadites. 30These are the sons of Gilead: of Iezer, the family of the Iezerites; of Helek, the family of the Helekites; 31of Asriel, the family of the Asrielites; of Shechem, the family of the Shechemites; 32of Shemida, the family of the Shemidaites; and of Hepher, the family of the Hepherites. 33Zelophehad the son of Hepher had no sons, but only daughters, and the names of Zelophehad’s daughters were Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 34These are the families (clans) of Manasseh; and those who were numbered of them were 52,700.\n\n35These are the sons of Ephraim according to their families: of Shuthelah, the family of the Shuthelahites; of Becher, the family of the Becherites; of Tahan, the family of the Tahanites. 36And these are the sons of Shuthelah: of Eran, the family of the Eranites. 37These are the families (clans) of the sons of Ephraim according to those who were numbered, 32,500. These are the descendants of Joseph according to their families (clans).\n\n38The sons of Benjamin according to their families: of Bela, the family of the Belaites; of Ashbel, the family of the Ashbelites; of Ahiram, the family of the Ahiramites; 39of Shephupham, the family of the Shuphamites; of Hupham, the family of the Huphamites. 40The sons of Bela were Ard and Naaman: of Ard, the family of the Ardites; of Naaman, the family of the Naamites. 41These are the sons of Benjamin according to their families (clans); and those who were numbered, 45,600.\n\n42These are the sons of Dan according to their families: of Shuham, the family of the Shuhamites. These are the families of Dan according to their families. 43All the families (clans) of the Shuhamites according to those who were numbered, 64,400.\n\n44Of the sons of Asher according to their families: of Imnah, the family of the Imnites; of Ishvi, the family of the Ishvites; of Beriah, the family of the Beriites. 45Of the sons of Beriah: of Heber, the family of the Heberites; of Malchiel, the family of the Malchielites. 46And the name of the daughter of Asher was Serah. 47These are the families (clans) of the sons of Asher according to those who were numbered, 53,400.\n\n48Of the sons of Naphtali according to their families: of Jahzeel, the family of the Jahzeelites; of Guni, the family of the Gunites; 49of Jezer, the family of the Jezerites; of Shillem, the family of the Shillemites. 50These are the families (clans) of Naphtali according to their families; and those who were numbered of them were 45,400.\n\n51This was the [total] number of the [male] Israelites, 601,730 [twenty years old and upward who were able to go to war].\n\n52And the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 53“Among these the land shall be divided as an inheritance according to the number of names. 54To the larger tribe you shall give the larger inheritance, and to the smaller tribe the smaller inheritance; each tribe shall be given its inheritance according to its numbers. 55But the land shall be divided by lot. They shall receive their inheritance according to the names of the tribes of their fathers (tribal ancestors). 56“According to the [location selected by] lot, their inheritance shall be divided between the larger and the smaller [groups].”\n\n57These are those who were numbered of the Levites according to their families: of Gershon, the family of the Gershonites; of Kohath, the family of the Kohathites; of Merari, the family of the Merarites. 58These are the families of Levi: the family of the Libnites, the family of the Hebronites, the family of the Mahlites, the family of the Mushites, the family of the Korahites. And Kohath was the father of Amram. 59The name of Amram’s wife was Jochebed, the daughter of Levi, who was born to Levi in Egypt; and to Amram she bore Aaron, Moses, and Miriam their sister. 60To Aaron were born Nadab, Abihu, Eleazar, and Ithamar. 61But Nadab and Abihu died [in the presence of God] when they offered [in their ceremonial censers] strange [unholy, unacceptable, unauthorized] fire before the LORD. 62Those numbered of the Levites were 23,000, every male from a month old and upward; for they were not numbered among the sons of Israel, since no inheritance [of land] was given to them among the Israelites.\n\n63These are those numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel [for the second time] in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [River] at Jericho. 64But among these there was not a man [left] of those numbered by Moses and Aaron the priest, who numbered the sons of Israel [for the first time] in the Wilderness of Sinai. 65For the LORD had said of them, “They shall certainly die in the wilderness.” And not a man was left of them except Caleb the son of Jephunneh and Joshua the son of Nun.\n\nNumbers 27\nA Law Of Inheritance\n\n1Then the [five] daughters of Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, from the tribes of Manasseh [who was] the son of Joseph, approached [with a request]. These are the names of his daughters: Mahlah, Noah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Tirzah. 2They stood before Moses, Eleazar the priest, the leaders, and all the congregation at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle), saying, 3“Our father died in the wilderness. He was not among those who assembled together against the LORD in the company of Korah, but he died for his own sin [as did all those who rebelled at Kadesh], and he had no sons. 4“Why should the name of our father be removed from his family because he had no son? Give to us a possession (land) among our father’s brothers.” 5So Moses brought their case before the LORD.\n\n6Then the LORD said to Moses, 7“The request of the daughters of Zelophehad is justified. You shall certainly give them a possession as an inheritance among their father’s brothers, and you shall transfer their father’s inheritance to them. 8Further, you shall say to the Israelites, ‘If a man dies and has no son, you shall transfer his inheritance to his daughter. 9‘If a man has no daughter, then you shall give his inheritance to his brothers. 10‘If a man has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his father’s brothers. 11‘If his father has no brothers, then you shall give his inheritance to his nearest relative in his own family, and he shall take possession of it. It shall be a statute and ordinance to the Israelites, just as the LORD has commanded Moses.’”\n\n12Then the LORD said to Moses, “Go up to this mountain (Nebo) [in the] Abarim [range] and look at the land I have given to the sons of Israel. 13When you have seen it, you too will be gathered to your people [in death], just as Aaron your brother was gathered; 14because in the Wilderness of Zin, during the strife of the congregation, you rebelled against My command to treat me as holy [by following My instruction] before their eyes at the water.” (These are the waters of Meribah in Kadesh in the Wilderness of Zin.)\n\nJoshua to Succeed Moses 15Then Moses spoke to the LORD, saying, 16“Let the LORD, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the congregation 17who will go out and come in before them, and will lead them out and bring them in, so that the congregation of the LORD will not be as sheep without a shepherd.” 18The LORD said to Moses, “Take Joshua the son of Nun, a man in whom is the Spirit, and lay your hand on him; 19and have him stand before Eleazar the priest and before the whole congregation, and give him a commission in their sight. 20You shall put some of your authority and honor on him, so that all the congregation of the Israelites will obey him. 21“He shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall inquire before the LORD for him by the judgment (decision) of the Urim. At Joshua’s command the people shall go out and at his command they shall come in, he and all the congregation of Israel with him.” 22Moses did as the LORD commanded him. He took Joshua and had him stand before Eleazar the priest and the whole congregation, 23and Moses laid his hands on Joshua and commissioned him, just as the LORD had commanded through Moses.\n\nNumbers 28\nLaws For Offerings\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Command the Israelites and say to them, ‘You shall be careful to present at its appointed time [during the year] My offering, My food for My offerings by fire as a sweet and soothing aroma to Me.’ 3You shall say to the people, ‘This is the offering by fire which you shall present to the LORD every day: two male lambs one year old without blemish as a continual burnt offering. 4‘You shall offer one lamb in the morning and you shall offer the other lamb at twilight, 5also a tenth of an ephah of finely-milled flour as a grain offering, mixed with a fourth of a hin of pressed oil. 6‘It is a continual burnt offering which was ordained on Mount Sinai as a sweet and soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 7‘Its drink offering shall be a fourth of a hin for each lamb, in the holy place you shall pour out a strong drink offering to the LORD. 8‘The other lamb you shall offer at twilight; as the grain offering of the morning and as its drink offering, you shall offer it, an offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD.\n\n9‘Then on the Sabbath day two male lambs one year old without blemish, and two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, and its drink offering. 10‘This is the burnt offering of every Sabbath, in addition to the continual burnt offering and its drink offering.\n\n11‘Then at the beginning of [each of] your months you shall present a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls, one ram, seven male lambs one year old without blemish; 12and three-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for each bull; and two-tenths [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering, for the one ram; 13and a tenth [of an ephah] of fine flour mixed with oil as a grain offering for each lamb, as a burnt offering of a sweet and soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD. 14‘Their drink offerings shall be half a hin of wine for a bull, and a third of a hin for a ram, and a fourth of a hin for a lamb. This is the burnt offering of each month throughout the months of the year. 15‘And one male goat as a sin offering to the LORD; it shall be offered with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering.\n\n16‘The LORD’S Passover shall be on the fourteenth day of the first month [of each year]. 17‘There shall be a feast on the fifteenth day of this month; unleavened bread shall be eaten for seven days. 18‘On the first day there shall be a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work that day. 19‘But you shall present an offering by fire, a burnt offering to the LORD: two bulls, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old, without blemish. 20‘For their grain offering you shall offer fine flour mixed with oil; three-tenths [of an ephah] for the bull, and two-tenths for the ram; 21you shall offer a tenth [of an ephah] for each of the seven male lambs; 22and one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 23‘You shall present these in addition to the burnt offering of the morning, which is for a continual burnt offering. 24‘In this way you shall present daily, for seven days, the food of the offering by fire, a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD; it shall be presented with its drink offering in addition to the continual burnt offering. 25‘On the seventh day you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work.\n\n26‘Also on the day of the first fruits, when you offer a new grain offering to the LORD at your Feast of Weeks, you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work. 27‘You shall present the burnt offering as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD: two young bulls, one ram, seven male lambs one year old; 28and their grain offering of fine flour mixed with oil; three-tenths [of an ephah] for each bull, two-tenths for the one ram, 29a tenth for each of the seven male lambs, 30and one male goat to make atonement for you. 31‘In addition to the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, you shall present them with their drink offerings. They shall be without blemish.\n\nNumbers 29\nOfferings Of The Seventh Month\n\n1‘On the first day of the seventh month, you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work. It will be for you a day of blowing the trumpets (the shophar, ram’s horn). 2‘You shall offer a burnt offering as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD: one bull, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old without blemish; 3also their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three-tenths [of an ephah] for the bull, two-tenths for the ram, 4and one-tenth [of an ephah] for each of the seven lambs, 5and one male goat as a sin offering to make atonement for you. 6‘These are in addition to the burnt offering of the New Moon and its grain offering, and the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings, according to the ordinance for them, as a sweet and soothing aroma, an offering by fire to the LORD.\n\n7‘Then on the tenth day of this seventh month you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly [for the Day of Atonement]; and you shall humble yourselves; you shall not do any work. 8‘You shall present a burnt offering to the LORD as a sweet and soothing aroma: one bull, one ram, and seven male lambs one year old, which are without blemish; 9and their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three-tenths [of an ephah] for the bull, two-tenths for the one ram, 10a tenth [of an ephah] for each of the seven lambs, 11one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the sin offering of atonement, and the continual burnt offering and its grain offering, and their drink offerings.\n\n12‘Then on the fifteenth day of the seventh month you shall have a holy [summoned] assembly; you shall do no laborious work, and you shall observe a Feast [of Booths] to the LORD for seven days. 13‘You shall present a burnt offering, an offering by fire as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD: thirteen bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs one year old, which are without blemish; 14and their grain offering, fine flour mixed with oil, three-tenths [of an ephah] for each of the thirteen bulls, two-tenths for each of the two rams, 15and a tenth [of an ephah] for each of the fourteen lambs; 16also one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, its grain offering and its drink offering.\n\n17‘Then on the second day [of the Feast of Booths]: twelve bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish, 18with their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance, 19also one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, its grain offering, and their drink offerings.\n\n20‘Then on the third day [of the Feast of Booths]: eleven bulls, two rams, fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish, 21with their grain offering and drink offerings for the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance, 22and one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering.\n\n23‘Then on the fourth day [of the Feast of Booths]: ten bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish; 24their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance, 25and one male goat as a sin offering, besides the continual burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offering.\n\n26‘Then on the fifth day [of the Feast of Booths]: nine bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish, 27and their grain offering and drink offerings for the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance; 28and one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, and its grain offering, and its drink offering.\n\n29‘Then on the sixth day [of the Feast of Booths]: eight bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish; 30and their grain offering and their drink offerings for the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance, 31and one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, its grain offering, and its drink offerings.\n\n32‘Then on the seventh day [of the Feast of Booths]: seven bulls, two rams, and fourteen male lambs one year old without blemish, 33and their grain offering and drink offerings for the bulls, the rams, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance; 34and one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, and its grain offering, and its drink offering.\n\n35‘On the eighth day you shall have a solemn assembly [to mark the end of the feast]; you shall do no laborious work. 36‘You shall present a burnt offering, an offering by fire, as a sweet and soothing aroma to the LORD: one bull, one ram, seven male lambs one year old without blemish; 37their grain offering and drink offerings for the bull, the ram, and the lambs, by their number according to the ordinance, 38and one male goat as a sin offering, in addition to the continual burnt offering, and its grain offering, and its drink offering.\n\n39‘You shall present these to the LORD at your appointed times, in addition the offerings you have vowed and your freewill offerings, as your burnt offerings, grain offerings, drink offerings, and as your peace offerings.’” 40So Moses spoke to the Israelites in accordance with everything that the LORD had commanded him.\n\nNumbers 30\nThe Law Of Vows\n\n1Then Moses spoke to the leaders of the tribes of the Israelites, saying, “This is the thing which the LORD has commanded: 2If a man makes a vow to the LORD or swears an oath to bind himself with a pledge [of abstinence], he shall not break (violate, profane) his word; he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth.\n\n3“Also if a woman makes a vow to the LORD and binds herself by a pledge [of abstinence], while living in her father’s house in her youth, 4and her father hears her vow and her pledge by which she has bound herself, and he offers no objection, then all her vows shall stand and every pledge by which she has bound herself shall stand. 5But if her father disapproves of her [making her vow] on the day that he hears about it, none of her vows or her pledges by which she has bound herself shall stand; and the LORD will forgive her because her father has disapproved of her [making the vow].\n\n6“But if she marries while under her vows or if she has bound herself by a rash statement, 7and her husband hears of it and says nothing about it on the day he hears it, then her vows shall stand and her pledge by which she bound herself shall stand. 8But if her husband disapproves of her [making her vow or pledge] on the day that he hears of it, then he shall annul her vow which she is under and the rash statement of her lips by which she bound herself; and the LORD will forgive her.\n\n9“But the vow of a widow or of a divorced woman, everything by which she has bound herself, shall stand against her. 10However, if she vowed in her husband’s house or bound herself by a pledge with an oath, 11and her husband heard it, but said nothing to her and did not disapprove of her [making the vow], then all her vows and every pledge by which she bound herself shall stand. 12But if her husband absolutely annuls them on the day he heard them, then whatever proceeds from her lips concerning her vows or concerning her pledge shall not stand. Her husband has annulled them, and the LORD will forgive her.\n\n13“Every vow and every binding oath to humble herself, her husband may confirm it or her husband may annul it. 14But if her husband says nothing to her [concerning the matter] from day to day, then he confirms all her vows or all her pledges which are on her. He has confirmed them because he said nothing to her on the day he heard them. 15“But if he indeed nullifies them after he hears of them, then he shall be responsible for and bear her guilt [for breaking her promise].”\n\n16These are the statutes which the LORD commanded Moses, between a man and his wife, and between a father and his daughter while she is a youth in her father’s house.\n\nNumbers 31\nThe Slaughter Of Midian\n\n1The LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Take vengeance for the Israelites on the Midianites; afterward you will be gathered to your people [in death].” 3Moses spoke to the people, saying, “Arm men from among you for war, so that they may go against Midian to execute the LORD’S vengeance on Midian [for seducing Israel to participate in idolatry]. 4“A thousand [fighting men] from each tribe of all the tribes of Israel you shall send to the war.” 5So out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand from each tribe were selected, twelve thousand armed for war. 6Moses sent them, a thousand from each tribe, to the war, and Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to war with them, and the sacred vessels [of the sanctuary] and the trumpets to blow the alarm in his hand. 7They made war against Midian, just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they killed every male. 8They killed the kings of Midian along with the rest of their slain: Evi and Rekem and Zur [the father of Cozbi] and Hur and Reba, the five kings of Midian; also Balaam the son of Beor they killed with the sword. 9The sons of Israel captured the women of Midian and their children; and all their cattle, all their livestock, and all their property they took as spoil [of war]. 10They burned all the cities where they lived, and all their encampments with fire. 11They took all the plunder and all the spoils of war, both people and livestock. 12Then they brought the captives, the spoils, and the plunder to Moses and to Eleazar the priest and to the congregation of the Israelites at the camp on the plains of Moab by the Jordan [River] across from Jericho.\n\n13Moses and Eleazar the priest and all the leaders of the congregation went out to meet them outside the camp. 14But Moses was angry with the officers of the army, the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, who served in the war. 15And Moses said to them, “Have you let all the women live? 16Look, these [are the women who] caused the Israelites, by the counsel of Balaam, to trespass against the LORD in the matter of Peor, and so a plague came among the congregation of the LORD. 17Now therefore, kill every male among the children, and kill every woman who is not a virgin. 18But all the young girls who have not known a man intimately, keep alive for yourselves [to marry]. 19Camp outside the camp for seven days; whoever has killed any person and whoever has touched any dead body, purify yourselves and your captives, on the third day and on the seventh day. 20“You shall purify every garment and every article made of leather and all the things made of goats’ hair, and every article made of wood.”\n\n21Then Eleazar the priest said to the men of war who had gone to battle, “This is the statute of the law which the LORD has commanded Moses: 22only the gold, the silver, the bronze, the iron, the tin, and the lead, 23everything that can stand fire, you shall pass through fire, and it shall be clean. Nevertheless, it shall also be purified with the water of purification [to remove its impurity]; and all that cannot stand fire [such as fabrics] you shall pass through water. 24“And you shall wash your clothes on the seventh day and be clean, and afterward you may come into the camp.”\n\nDivision of the Spoil of War 25Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 26“You and Eleazar the priest and the leaders of the fathers’ households of the congregation are to take a count of the spoil of war that was captured, both people and livestock. 27Divide the spoil into two [equal] parts between those who were involved in the war, that is, those who went out to battle and all [the rest of] the congregation. 28Levy a tax for the LORD from the warriors who went to battle, one in five hundred of the persons, the oxen, the donkeys, and the flocks. 29Take this tribute from the warriors’ half and give it to Eleazar the priest as an offering to the LORD. 30“From the Israelites’ half [of the spoil] you shall take one out of every fifty of the persons, the oxen, the donkeys, the flocks, and of all the livestock, and give them to the Levites who are in charge of the tabernacle of the LORD.” 31Moses and Eleazar the priest did just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n32The plunder that remained from the spoil of war which the warriors had taken, was 675,000 sheep, 33and 72,000 cattle, 34and 61,000 donkeys, 35and 32,000 persons in all, of the [Midianite] women who were virgins.\n\n36The half share, the portion of those who went to war, was 337,500 sheep in number, 37and the LORD’S levy (tax) of the sheep was 675; 38the cattle were 36,000, from which the LORD’S levy was 72; 39the donkeys were 30,500, from which the LORD’S levy was 61; 40the persons were 16,000, from whom the LORD’S levy was 32 persons. 41Moses gave the levy which was the LORD’S offering to Eleazar the priest, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n42As for the Israelites’ half, which Moses separated from that of the warriors— 43now the congregation’s half was 337,500 sheep, 44and 36,000 cattle, 45and 30,500 donkeys, 46and 16,000 people— 47and from the Israelites’ half, Moses took one out of every fifty, both of persons and animals, and gave them to the Levites, who were in charge of the tabernacle of the LORD, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n48Then the officers who were over the thousands of the army, the commanders of thousands and hundreds, approached Moses, 49and they said to him, “Your servants have counted the warriors under our command, and not one man of us is missing. 50“So we have brought as an offering to the LORD what each man obtained—articles of gold, armlets, bracelets, signet rings, earrings, necklaces—to make atonement for ourselves before the LORD.” 51Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold from them, all the handmade articles. 52All the gold of the offering which they presented to the LORD from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds was 16,750 shekels. 53For the men of war had taken plunder, every man for himself. 54So Moses and Eleazar the priest received the gold from the commanders of thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle) as a memorial for the sons of Israel before the LORD.\n\nNumbers 32\nReuben And Gad Settle In Gilead\n\n1Now the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad had very large herds of cattle, and they saw the land of Jazer and the land of Gilead [on the east side of the Jordan River], and indeed, the place was suitable for raising livestock. 2So the sons of Gad and of Reuben came and spoke to Moses, to Eleazar the priest, and to the leaders of the congregation, saying, 3“[The country around] Ataroth, Dibon, Jazer, Nimrah, Heshbon, Elealeh, Sebam, Nebo, and Beon, 4the land which the LORD conquered before the congregation of Israel, is a land [suitable] for livestock, and your servants have [very large herds of] livestock.” 5They said, “If we have found favor in your sight, let this land be given to your servants as a possession. Do not take us across the Jordan [River].”\n\n6But Moses said to the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben, “Shall your brothers go to war while you sit here? 7Now why are you discouraging the hearts of the Israelites from crossing over into the land which the LORD has given them? 8This is what your fathers did when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see the land! 9For when they went up to the Valley of Eshcol and saw the land, they discouraged the hearts of the Israelites so that they did not go into the land which the LORD had given them. 10And the LORD’S anger was kindled on that day and He swore an oath, saying, 11‘None of the men who came up from Egypt, from twenty years old and upward, shall see the land which I promised to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, because they have not followed Me completely, 12except Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite and Joshua the son of Nun, for they have followed the LORD completely.’ 13So the LORD’S anger was kindled against the sons of Israel (Jacob) and He made them wander in the wilderness forty years, until the entire generation of those who had done evil in the sight of the LORD was destroyed. 14Now look, you [the tribes of Reuben and Gad] have risen up in your fathers’ place, a brood of sinful men, to add still more to the fierce anger of the LORD against Israel. 15“For if you turn back from following Him [completely], He will once again leave them in the wilderness, and you will destroy all these people.”\n\n16But the people of Reuben and Gad approached Moses and said, “We will build sheepfolds here for our flocks and [walled] cities for our children, 17but we will be armed and ready to go to war before the [other tribes of the] Israelites, until we have brought them to their place, while our children live in the fortified cities because of the inhabitants of the land. 18We will not return to our homes until every one of the [other] sons of Israel has taken possession of his inheritance. 19“For we will not inherit with them on the west side of the Jordan and beyond, because our inheritance has come to us on this side of the Jordan [River] toward the east.”\n\n20Moses replied, “If you will do as you say, if you will arm yourselves before the LORD for war, 21and every armed man of yours will cross the Jordan before the LORD until He has driven out His enemies before Him, 22and the land [west of the Jordan] is subdued before the LORD, then afterward you shall return and be blameless [in this matter] before the LORD and before Israel, and this land [east of the Jordan] shall be yours as a possession before the LORD. 23But if you do not do this, behold, you will have sinned against the LORD; and be sure that your sin will find you out. 24“Build yourselves cities for your children, and folds for your sheep, and do that of which you have spoken.”\n\n25Then the descendants of Gad and of Reuben said to Moses, “Your servants will do just as my lord commands. 26Our children, our wives, our livestock, and all our cattle shall be there in the cities of Gilead. 27“But your servants will cross over, every man armed for war, before the LORD to the battle, just as my lord says.”\n\n28So Moses gave the command concerning them to Eleazar the priest, and to Joshua the son of Nun, and to the leaders of the fathers’ households of the tribes of the Israelites. 29Moses said to them, “If the sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben will cross over the Jordan with you, every man armed for battle before the LORD, and the land is subdued before you, then you shall give them the land of Gilead [east of the Jordan River] as a possession; 30but if they will not cross over with you armed, they shall have possessions among you in the land of Canaan [and surrender their right to their land east of the Jordan River].” 31The sons of Gad and the sons of Reuben answered, “As the LORD has said to your servants, so will we do. 32“We will cross over armed before the LORD into the land of Canaan, so that the possession of our inheritance on [the east] side of the Jordan may be ours.”\n\n33So Moses gave to them, to the sons of Gad and to the sons of Reuben and to the half-tribe of Manasseh the son of Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon, the king of the Amorites and the kingdom of Og, the king of Bashan, the land with its cities and territories, the cities of the surrounding land. 34The sons of Gad built Dibon, Ataroth, Aroer, 35Atroth-shophan, Jazer, Jogbehah, 36Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fortified (walled) cities, and sheepfolds for sheep. 37The sons of Reuben built Heshbon, Elealeh, Kiriathaim, 38Nebo, and Baal-meon (their names being changed) and Sibmah; and they gave other names to the cities which they built. 39The sons of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead and took it, and drove out the Amorites who were in it. 40So Moses gave Gilead to [the tribe of] Machir the son of Manasseh, and they settled in it. 41[The sons of] Jair the son of Manasseh went and took its towns (tent villages) and called them Havvoth-jair. 42Nobah went and took Kenath and its villages, and called it Nobah after his own name.\n\nNumbers 33\nReview Of The Journey From Egypt To Jordan\n\n1These are the stages of the journeys of the Israelites, by which they came out of the land of Egypt by their [tribal] armies, under the leadership of Moses and Aaron. 2Moses recorded their points of departure, as the LORD commanded, stage by stage; and these are their journeys according to their points of departure: 3They set out from Rameses on the fifteenth day of the first month; on the day after the Passover the Israelites moved out triumphantly in the sight of all the Egyptians, 4while the Egyptians were burying all their firstborn whom the LORD had struck down among them. Upon their gods the LORD also executed judgments.\n\n5Then the Israelites moved out from Rameses [where they had all joined together], and camped in Succoth. 6They moved out from Succoth and camped in Etham, which is on the edge of the wilderness. 7They moved out from Etham and turned back to Pi-hahiroth, east of Baal-zephon, and they camped before Migdol. 8They moved out from before Pi-hahiroth and passed through the midst of the [Red] Sea into the wilderness; and they went a three days’ journey in the Wilderness of Etham and camped at Marah. 9They moved out from Marah and came to Elim; in Elim there were twelve springs of water and seventy palm trees, and they camped there. 10They moved out from Elim and camped by the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds). 11They moved out from the Red Sea and camped in the Wilderness of Sin. 12They moved out from the Wilderness of Sin and camped at Dophkah. 13They moved out from Dophkah and camped at Alush. 14They moved out from Alush and camped at Rephidim; now it was there that the people had no water to drink. 15They moved out from Rephidim and camped in the Wilderness of Sinai [where they remained for about a year]. 16They moved out from the Wilderness of Sinai and camped at Kibroth-hattaavah.\n\n17They moved out from Kibroth-hattaavah and camped at Hazeroth. 18They moved out from Hazeroth and camped at Rithmah [near Kadesh, the place from which the twelve spies were sent to spy out the land of Canaan]. 19They moved out from Rithmah and camped at Rimmon-perez. 20They moved out from Rimmon-perez and camped at Libnah. 21They moved out from Libnah and camped at Rissah. 22They moved out from Rissah and camped at Kehelathah. 23They moved out from Kehelathah and camped at Mount Shepher. 24They moved out from Mount Shepher and camped at Haradah. 25They moved out from Haradah and camped at Makheloth. 26They moved out from Makheloth and camped at Tahath. 27They moved out from Tahath and camped at Terah. 28They moved out from Terah and camped at Mithkah. 29They moved out from Mithkah and camped at Hashmonah. 30They moved out from Hashmonah and camped at Moseroth. 31They moved out from Moseroth and camped at Bene-jaakan. 32They moved out from Bene-jaakan and camped at Hor-haggidgad. 33They moved out from Hor-haggidgad and camped at Jotbathah. 34They moved out from Jotbathah and camped at Abronah. 35They moved out from Abronah and camped at Ezion-geber [or Elath on the gulf of Aqabah]. 36They moved out from Ezion-geber and camped in the Wilderness of Zin, which is Kadesh. 37They moved out from Kadesh and camped at Mount Hor, on the edge of the land of Edom.\n\n38Aaron the priest went up on Mount Hor at the command of the LORD, and died there in the fortieth year after the Israelites came out of the land of Egypt, on the first day of the fifth month. 39Aaron was a hundred and twenty-three years old when he died on Mount Hor.\n\n40The Canaanite king of Arad, who lived in the Negev (the South country) in the land of Canaan, heard that the sons of Israel were coming.\n\n41They moved out from Mount Hor and camped at Zalmonah. 42Then they moved out from Zalmonah and camped at Punon. 43They moved out from Punon and camped at Oboth. 44They moved out from Oboth and camped at Iye-abarim, on the border of Moab. 45They moved out from Iyim (Iye-abarim) and camped at Dibon-gad. 46They moved out from Dibon-gad and camped at Almon-diblathaim. 47They moved out from Almon-diblathaim and camped in the mountains of Abarim, before [Mount] Nebo. 48They moved out from the mountains of Abarim and camped in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho [their last stop on the journey to Canaan]. 49They camped by the Jordan from Beth-jeshimoth as far as Abel-shittim in the plains of Moab.\n\nLaw of Possessing the Land 50Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan across from Jericho, saying, 51“Say to the children of Israel, ‘When you cross the Jordan into the land of Canaan, 52then you shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land before you and destroy all their sculpted images, and destroy all their cast idols and completely eliminate all their [idolatrous] high places, 53and you shall take possession of the land and live in it, for I have given the land to you to possess. 54‘You shall inherit the land by lot according to your families; to the large tribe you shall give a larger inheritance, and to the small tribe you shall give a smaller inheritance. Wherever the lot falls to any man, that shall be [the location of] his [inheritance]. According to the tribes of your fathers (ancestors) you shall inherit. 55‘But if you do not drive out the inhabitants of the land from before you, then those you let remain of them will be like pricks in your eyes and like thorns in your sides, and they will attack you in the land in which you live. 56‘And as I [the LORD] planned to do to them, so I will do to you.’”\n\nNumbers 34\nInstruction For Apportioning Canaan\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 2“Command the Israelites, ‘When you enter the land of Canaan, this is the land that shall be yours as an inheritance, the land of Canaan according to its boundaries, 3your southern region shall be from the Wilderness of Zin along the side of Edom, and your southern boundary from the end of the Salt (Dead) Sea eastward. 4‘Your boundary shall turn from the south to the ascent of Akrabbim, and continue on to Zin, and its limit shall be south of Kadesh-barnea. Then it shall go on to Hazar-addar and pass on to Azmon. 5‘Then the boundary shall turn from Azmon to the Brook of Egypt (Wadi el-arish), and its limit shall be at the [Mediterranean] Sea.\n\n6‘As the western boundary you shall have the Great [Mediterranean] Sea and its coastline. This shall be your western boundary.\n\n7‘And this shall be your north border: from the Great [Mediterranean] Sea mark out your boundary line to Mount Hor; 8from Mount Hor you shall mark out your boundary to the entrance of Hamath, and the limit of the border shall be at Zedad; 9then the [northern] boundary shall go on to Ziphron, and its limit shall be at Hazar-enan. This shall be your northern boundary.\n\n10‘You shall mark out your eastern boundary from Hazar-enan to Shepham; 11the [eastern] boundary shall go down from Shepham to Riblah on the east side of Ain and shall descend and reach to the slope on the east of the Sea of Chinnereth [the Sea of Galilee]; 12and the [eastern] boundary shall go down to the Jordan [River], and its limit shall be at the Salt (Dead) Sea. This shall be your land according to its boundaries all around.’”\n\n13So Moses commanded the Israelites, saying, “This is the land you are to inherit by lot, which the LORD has commanded to be given to the nine tribes and the half-tribe [of Manasseh], 14for the tribe of the sons of Reuben and the tribe of the sons of Gad have received their inheritance by their fathers’ households, and the half-tribe of Manasseh have received their possession. 15“The two and a half tribes have received their inheritance across the Jordan [River] opposite Jericho, eastward toward the sunrise.”\n\n16Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 17“These are the names of the men who shall divide the land among you as an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun. 18You shall take one leader from every tribe to divide the land for the inheritance. 19These are the names of the men: From the tribe of Judah, Caleb the son of Jephunneh; 20from the tribe of the sons of Simeon, Samuel the son of Ammihud; 21from the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon; 22from the tribe of the sons of Dan a leader, Bukki the son of Jogli; 23of the sons of Joseph: from the tribe of the sons of Manasseh a leader, Hanniel the son of Ephod; 24from the tribe of the sons of Ephraim a leader, Kemuel the son of Shiphtan; 25from the tribe of the sons of Zebulun a leader, Elizaphan the son of Parnach; 26from the tribe of the sons of Issachar a leader, Paltiel the son of Azzan; 27from the tribe of the sons of Asher a leader, Ahihud the son of Shelomi; 28from the tribe of the sons of Naphtali a leader, Pedahel the son of Ammihud.” 29These are the [twelve] men whom the LORD commanded [to work with Joshua and Eleazar] to divide the inheritance to the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan.\n\nNumbers 35\nCities For The Levites\n\n1Then the LORD spoke to Moses in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho, saying, 2“Command the Israelites to give to the Levites cities to live in from the inheritance of their possession; and you shall give to the Levites pasture lands around the cities. 3The cities shall be theirs to live in; and their pasture lands shall be for their cattle and for their herds and for all their livestock.\n\n4“The pasture lands around the cities which you shall give to the Levites shall reach from the wall of the city and outward a thousand cubits (1,500 ft.) around. 5You shall also measure outside the city on the east, south, west, and north sides two thousand cubits (3,000 ft.), with the city in the center. This shall belong to the Levites as pasture lands for the cities. Cities of Refuge 6[Among] the cities which you give to the Levites shall be the six cities of refuge, which you shall provide for the one who commits manslaughter to flee to; and in addition to them you shall give forty-two cities [to the Levites]. 7So you shall give to the Levites forty-eight cities in all, together with their pasture lands. 8“As for the cities which you shall give from the possession of the Israelites, from the larger tribes you shall take many and from the smaller tribes few; each tribe shall give [at least some] of its cities to the Levites in proportion to [the size of] its inheritance which it possesses.”\n\n9Then the LORD spoke to Moses, saying, 10“Tell the Israelites, ‘When you cross the Jordan [River] into the land of Canaan, 11then you shall select for yourselves cities to be cities of refuge, so that the one who kills any person unintentionally may escape there. 12‘The cities shall be to you as a refuge from the avenger, so that the one who has caused the death of another will not be killed until he has had a [fair] trial before the congregation. 13‘The cities which you are to provide shall be your six cities of refuge. 14‘You shall provide three cities on this [east] side of the Jordan [River], and three [more] cities in the land of Canaan; they are to be the cities of refuge. 15‘These six cities shall be a refuge for the Israelites and for the stranger and the resident alien among them; so that anyone who kills a person unintentionally may escape there.\n\n16‘But if he struck his victim down [intentionally] with an iron object so that he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall certainly be put to death. 17‘If he struck his victim down [intentionally] with a stone in hand, which may cause a person to die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall certainly be put to death. 18‘Or if he struck his victim down [intentionally] with a wooden object in hand, which may cause a person to die, and he died, he is a murderer; the murderer shall certainly be put to death. 19‘The blood avenger shall himself put the murderer to death; he shall put him to death when he meets him. 20‘But if he pushed his victim out of hatred or threw something at him with malicious intent, and he died, 21or if, in enmity, he struck the victim down with his hand, and he died, the one that struck the victim shall certainly be put to death; he is a murderer. The blood avenger shall put the murderer to death when he meets him.\n\n22‘But if he pushed the victim suddenly, not in enmity, or threw anything at him without malicious intent, 23or without seeing him hit him [accidentally] with a stone object that could kill him, and he died, and [the offender] was not his enemy nor intending to harm him, 24then the congregation shall judge between the offender and the blood avenger according to these ordinances. 25‘The congregation shall rescue the offender from the hand of the blood avenger and return him to his city of refuge, [the place] to which he had escaped; and he shall live there until the death of the high priest who was anointed with the sacred oil. 26‘But if at any time the one guilty of manslaughter comes outside the border of his city of refuge to which he fled, 27and the blood avenger finds him outside the border of his city of refuge and kills the offender, the blood avenger will not be guilty of murder, 28because the offender should have remained in his city of refuge until the death of the high priest. But after the high priest’s death the offender shall return to the land of his possession.\n\n29‘These things shall be a statute for you throughout your generations wherever you may be.\n\n30‘If anyone kills a person [intentionally], the murderer shall be put to death on the testimony of [two or more] witnesses; but no one shall be put to death on the testimony of [only] one witness. 31‘Moreover, you shall not accept a ransom [in exchange] for the life of a murderer guilty and sentenced to death; but he shall certainly be put to death. 32‘You shall not accept a ransom for him who has escaped to his city of refuge, so that he may return to live in his [own] land before the death of the high priest. 33‘So you shall not pollute and defile the land in which you live; for [the shedding of innocent] blood pollutes and defiles the land. No atonement (expiation) can be made for the land for the [innocent] blood shed in it, except by the blood (execution) of him who shed it. 34‘You shall not defile the land in which you live, in the midst of which I live, for I, the LORD, live among the people of Israel.’”\n\nNumbers 36\nInheritance By Marriage\n\n1The leaders of the fathers’ households of the family of the sons of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of Joseph, approached and spoke before Moses and before the leaders, the heads of the fathers’ households of the Israelites, 2and they said, “The LORD commanded my lord [Moses] to give the land by lot to the sons of Israel as an inheritance, and my lord was commanded by the LORD to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother to his daughters. 3But if the daughters marry any of the men from any of the other tribes of Israel, then their inheritance will be taken away from that of our fathers (tribal ancestors) and will be added to the inheritance of the tribe to which they belong; so it will be taken away from our allotted inheritance. 4“When the [year of] Jubilee of the Israelites comes, then their inheritance will be added [permanently] to that of the tribe to which they belong; so their inheritance will be taken away from that of the tribe of our fathers (tribal ancestors).”\n\n5Then Moses commanded the Israelites in accordance with the word of the LORD, saying, “The statement of the tribe of the sons of Joseph is correct. 6This is what the LORD commands regarding the daughters of Zelophehad: ‘Let them marry whom they wish; only they must marry within the family of the tribe of their father.’ 7So no inheritance of the Israelites shall be transferred from tribe to tribe, for every one of the Israelites shall hold to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers (tribal ancestors). 8Every daughter who possesses an inheritance [of land] in any one of the tribes of the Israelites shall marry [only] a man whose family is of her father’s tribe, so that the Israelites may each possess the inheritance of his fathers (tribal ancestors). 9“So no inheritance shall be transferred from one tribe to another, but each of the tribes of the Israelites shall hold to its own inheritance.”\n\n10The daughters of Zelophehad did as the LORD commanded Moses. 11For Mahlah, Tirzah, Hoglah, Milcah, and Noah, the daughters of Zelophehad, were married to sons of their father’s brothers. 12They married into the families of the descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph, and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the family of their father.\n\n13These are the commandments and the ordinances (judgments) which the LORD commanded through Moses to the sons of Israel in the plains of Moab by the Jordan [across from] Jericho."

          "content": "Deuteronomy 1\nIsrael’s History After The Exodus\n\n1These are the words which Moses spoke to all Israel [while they were still] beyond [that is, on the east side of] the Jordan [River] in the wilderness [across from Jerusalem], in the Arabah [the long, deep valley running north and south from the eastern arm of the Red Sea to beyond the Dead Sea] opposite Suph, between Paran and Tophel and Laban and Hazeroth and Dizahab (place of gold). 2It is [only] eleven days’ journey from Horeb (Mount Sinai) by way of Mount Seir to Kadesh-barnea [on Canaan’s border; yet Israel wandered in the wilderness for forty years before crossing the border and entering Canaan, the promised land]. 3In the fortieth year, on the first day of the eleventh month, Moses spoke to the children of Israel in accordance with all that the LORD had commanded him to say to them, 4after he had defeated Sihon the king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and Og the king of Bashan, who lived at Ashtaroth in Edrei. 5Beyond (east of) the Jordan in the land of Moab, Moses began to explain this law, saying,\n\n6“The LORD our God spoke to us at Horeb, saying, ‘You have stayed long enough on this mountain. 7‘Turn and resume your journey, and go to the hill country of the Amorites, and to all their neighbors in the Arabah, in the hill country and in the lowland (the Shephelah), in the Negev (South country) and on the coast of the [Mediterranean] Sea, the land of the Canaanites, and Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates. 8‘Look, I have set the land before you; go in and take possession of the land which the LORD swore (solemnly promised) to your fathers, to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob, to give to them and to their descendants after them.’\n\n9“I spoke to you at that time, saying, ‘I am not able to bear the burden of you alone. 10‘The LORD your God has multiplied you, and look, today you are as numerous as the stars of heaven. 11‘May the LORD, the God of your fathers, add to you a thousand times as many as you are and bless you, just as He has promised you! 12‘How can I alone bear the weight and pressure and burden of you and your strife (contention) and complaining? 13‘Choose for yourselves wise, understanding, experienced, and respected men from your tribes, and I will appoint them as heads (leaders) over you.’ 14And you answered me, ‘The thing which you have said to do is good.’ 15So I took the leaders of your tribes, wise and experienced men, and made them leaders over you, commanders of thousands, and hundreds, and fifties, and tens, and officers (administrators) for your tribes.\n\n16“Then I commanded your judges at that time, saying, ‘Hear the matters between your brothers [your fellow countrymen], and judge righteously and fairly between a man and his brother, or the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) who is with him. 17‘You shall not show partiality in judgment; you shall hear and pay attention to the [cases of the] least [important] as well as the great. You shall not fear man, for the judgment is God’s. The case that is too hard for you [to judge], you shall bring to me, and I will hear it.’ 18I commanded you at that time [regarding] all the things that you should do.\n\n19“Then we set out from Horeb (Sinai), and went through all that great and terrible wilderness which you saw on the way to the hill country of the Amorites, just as the LORD our God commanded us; and we came to Kadesh-barnea. 20And I said to you, ‘You have come to the hill country of the Amorites which the LORD our God is about to give us. 21‘Behold, the LORD your God has set the land before you; go up and take possession of it, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has spoken to you. Do not fear or be dismayed.’\n\n22“Then all of you approached me and said, ‘Let us send men [into the land] before us, so that they may explore and search the area for us, and bring back to us word regarding the way we should go, and the cities we should enter.’ 23The plan pleased me and I took twelve of your men, one man from each tribe. 24They turned and went up into the hill country, and came to the Valley of Eshcol and spied it out. 25Then they took some of the fruit of the land in their hands and brought it down to us; and they reported back to us, and said, ‘It is a good land which the LORD our God is about to give us.’\n\n26“Yet you were not willing to go up [to take possession of it], but rebelled against the command of the LORD your God. 27You murmured and were ill-tempered (discontented) in your tents, and said, ‘Because the LORD hates us He has brought us from the land of Egypt to hand us over to the Amorites to destroy us. 28‘Where can we go up? Our brothers (spies) have made our hearts melt [in fear] and demoralized us by saying, “The people are bigger and taller than we; the cities are large, and fortified [all the way up] to heaven. And besides, we saw the [giant-like] sons of the Anakim there.”’ 29Then I said to you, ‘Do not be shocked, nor fear them. 30‘The LORD your God who goes before you will fight for you Himself, just as He did for you in Egypt before your [very] eyes, 31and in the wilderness where you saw how the LORD your God carried and protected you, just as a man carries his son, all along the way which you traveled until you arrived at this place.’ 32Yet in spite of this word, you did not trust [that is, confidently rely on and believe] the LORD your God, 33who went before you along the way, in fire by night and in a cloud by day, to seek a place for you to make camp and to show you the way in which you should go.\n\n34“And the LORD heard the sound of your words, and He was angry and took an oath, saying, 35‘Not one of these men, this evil generation, shall see the good land which I swore (solemnly promised) to give to your fathers, 36except Caleb the son of Jephunneh; he shall see it, and to him and to his children I will give the land on which he has walked, because he has followed the LORD completely [and remained true to Him].’ 37The LORD was angry with me also because of you, saying, ‘Not even you shall enter Canaan. 38‘Joshua the son of Nun, who stands before you, he shall enter there. Encourage and strengthen him, for he shall cause Israel to inherit it. 39‘Moreover, your little ones whom you said would become prey, and your sons, who today have no knowledge of good or evil, shall enter Canaan, and I will give it to them and they shall possess it. 40‘But as for you, turn around and set out for the wilderness by way of the Red Sea (Sea of Reeds).’\n\n41“Then you answered and said to me, ‘We have sinned against the LORD. We will go up and fight, just as the LORD our God has commanded us.’ So you equipped every man with weapons of war, and regarded it as easy to go up into the hill country. 42“But the LORD said to me, ‘Say to them, “Do not go up and do not fight, for I am not among you [because of your rebellion]; otherwise you will be [badly] defeated by your enemies.”’ 43So I spoke to you, but you would not listen. Instead you rebelled against the command of the LORD, and acted presumptuously and went up into the hill country. 44Then the Amorites who lived in that hill country came out against you and chased you as bees do, and struck you down in Seir as far as Hormah. 45And you returned and wept before the LORD; but the LORD would not listen to your voice nor pay attention to you. 46So you stayed in Kadesh; many days you stayed there.\n\nDeuteronomy 2\nWanderings In The Wilderness\n\n1“Then we turned and set out for the wilderness by the way of the Red Sea, just as the LORD had told me; and we circled Mount Seir for many days. 2And the LORD spoke to me, saying, 3‘You have circled this mountain long enough; turn northward, 4and command the people, saying, “You are passing through the territory of your brothers the sons of Esau (the Edomites), who live in Seir; and they will be afraid of you. So be very careful; 5do not provoke them, for I will not give you any of their land, not even as little as a footstep, because I have given Mount Seir to Esau as a possession. 6You shall buy food from them with money so that you may [have something to] eat, and you shall also buy water from them with money so that you may [have something to] drink. 7“For the LORD your God has blessed you in all that you have done; He has known about your wanderings through this great wilderness. These forty years the LORD your God has been with you; you have lacked nothing.”’\n\n8“So we passed beyond our brothers the sons of Esau, who lived in Seir, away from the Arabah (wilderness) road, away from Elath and from Ezion-geber. Then we turned and passed through by the way of the Wilderness of Moab. 9And the LORD said to me, ‘Do not harass [the descendants of] Moab, nor provoke them to war, for I will not give you any of their land as a possession, because I have given Ar to the sons (Moab and Ammon) of Lot as a possession.’ 10(The Emim lived there in times past, a people great and numerous, and as tall as the Anakim. 11These also are regarded as Rephaim [an ancient people], as are the Anakim, but the Moabites call them Emim. 12The Horites also used to live in Seir, but the sons of Esau dispossessed them. They destroyed them from before them and settled in their place, just as Israel did in the land which the LORD gave them as their possession.) 13‘Now arise and cross the valley of the Zered.’ So we crossed the Zered Valley. 14Now thirty-eight years passed from the time we left Kadesh-barnea until we crossed the Zered Valley, until that entire generation of the men of war had died from within the camp, just as the LORD had sworn to them. 15Moreover the hand of the LORD was against them, to destroy them from within the camp, until they were all dead.\n\n16“So it came about when all the men of war had finally died from among the people, 17that the LORD spoke to me, saying, 18‘Today you are to pass through Ar, the border of Moab. 19‘When you come opposite the territory of the sons of Ammon, do not harass them nor provoke them, for I will not give you any of the land of the sons of Ammon as a possession, because I have given it to the sons of Lot as a possession.’ 20(It is also regarded as the land of the Rephaim [of giant stature], for Rephaim used to live there, but the Ammonites call them Zamzummin, 21a great, numerous people, and tall as the Anakim, but the LORD destroyed them before the sons of Ammon. And they dispossessed them and settled in their place, 22just as He did for the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, when He destroyed the Horites from before them; and the sons of Esau (the Edomites) dispossessed them and settled in their place [and remain there] even to this day. 23As for the Avvim, who lived in villages as far as Gaza, the Caphtorim (Cretans, later Philistines) who came from Caphtor (Crete) destroyed them and settled in their place.) 24‘Now arise, continue on, and go through the valley of the Arnon. Look, I have handed over to you Sihon the Amorite, king of Heshbon, and his land. Begin! Take possession [of it] and fight with him in battle. 25‘This day I will begin to put the dread and the fear of you on the peoples (pagans) under the whole heaven, who, when they hear the reports about you, will tremble and be in anguish because of you.’\n\n26“So I sent messengers from the Wilderness of Kedemoth to Sihon king of Heshbon with words of peace, saying, 27‘Let me pass through your land [with my people]. I will travel [with them] only on the highway; I will not turn away to the right or to the left. 28‘You will sell me food for money so that I [along with my people] will eat, and you will give me water for money so that I [along with my people] will drink; only let me [and my people] travel through [the land] on foot, 29just as the sons of Esau, who live in Seir, and the Moabites, who live in Ar, did for me, until I cross the Jordan into the land which the LORD our God is giving us.’ 30But Sihon king of Heshbon was not willing for us to travel through his land; for the LORD your God hardened his spirit and made his heart obstinate, in order to hand him over to you, as he is today. 31The LORD said to me, ‘Look, I have begun to hand over to you Sihon and his land. Begin! Take possession [of it], so that you may possess his land.’\n\n32“Then at Jahaz, Sihon and all his people came out to meet us in battle. 33So the LORD our God handed him over to us [and gave us the victory], and we defeated him and his sons and all his people. 34At the same time we took all his cities and utterly destroyed every city—men, women and children. We left no survivor. 35We took only the cattle as plunder for ourselves and the spoil of the cities which we had captured. 36From Aroer, which is on the edge of the Arnon Valley, and from the city which is in the valley, as far as Gilead, there was no city [whose wall was] too high and too strong for us; the LORD our God handed over everything to us. 37Only you did not go near the land of the sons of Ammon, all along the river Jabbok and the cities of the hill country, and wherever the LORD our God had forbidden us.\n\nDeuteronomy 3\nConquests Recounted\n\n1“Then we turned and went up the road toward Bashan, and at Edrei, Og king of Bashan, with all his people came out to meet us in battle. 2And the LORD said to me, ‘Do not fear him, for I have handed him over to you, him and all his people and his land; and you shall do to him just as you did to Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived at Heshbon.’ 3So the LORD our God also handed over Og king of Bashan, and all his people, into our hand and we struck him until no survivor was left. 4We captured all his cities at that time; there was not a city which we did not take from them: sixty cities, the whole region of Argob, the kingdom of Og in Bashan. 5All these cities were fortified and unassailable with their high walls, gates, and bars; in addition, [there were] a very great number of unwalled villages. 6We utterly destroyed them, just as we did to Sihon king of Heshbon, utterly destroying every city—the men, women, and children. 7But we took all the cattle and the spoil of the cities as plunder for ourselves.\n\n8“So we took the land at that time from the hand of the two kings [Sihon and Og] of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, from the valley of the Arnon to Mount Hermon 9(the Sidonians call Hermon Sirion, and the Amorites call it Senir): 10all the cities of the plain and all Gilead and all Bashan, as far as Salecah and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan.” 11(For only Og king of Bashan was left of the remnant of the [the giants known as the] Rephaim. Behold, his bed frame was a bed frame of iron; is it not in Rabbah of the Ammonites? It was nine cubits (12 ft.) long and four cubits (6 ft.) wide, using the cubit of a man [the forearm to the end of the middle finger].)\n\n12“So we took possession of this land at that time. I gave the territory from Aroer, which is by the valley of the Arnon, along with half of the hill country of Gilead and its cities to the Reubenites and to the Gadites. 13The rest of Gilead and all of Bashan, the kingdom of Og, I gave to the half-tribe of Manasseh, that is, all the region of Argob (concerning all Bashan, it is called the land of Rephaim. 14Jair the son (descendant) of Manasseh took all the region of Argob as far as the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, that is Bashan, and called it after his own name, Havvoth (the villages of) Jair, as it is called to this day.) 15I gave Gilead to Machir [of Manasseh]. 16To the Reubenites and Gadites I gave the territory from Gilead as far as the Valley of Arnon, with the middle of the Valley as a boundary, and as far as the Jabbok River, the boundary of the sons of Ammon; 17the Arabah also, with the Jordan as its boundary, from Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee) as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea (Dead Sea), at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah on the east.\n\n18“Then I commanded you [Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh] at that time, saying, ‘The LORD your God has given you this land to possess; all you who are brave men shall cross over [the Jordan] armed before your brothers, the sons of Israel. 19‘But your wives and your children and your cattle—I know that you have much livestock—shall remain in your cities which I have given you, 20until the LORD gives rest to your fellow countrymen as [He has] to you, and they also possess the land which the LORD your God has given them beyond the Jordan. Then each of you may return to the land (possession) which I have given to you.’ 21I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, ‘Your eyes have seen everything that the LORD your God has done to these two kings [Sihon and Og]; so the LORD shall do the same to all the kingdoms into which you are about to cross. 22‘Do not fear them, for it is the LORD your God who is fighting for you.’\n\n23“Then I pleaded with the LORD at that time [for His favor], saying, 24‘O Lord GOD, You have only begun to show Your servant Your greatness and Your mighty hand; for what god is there in heaven or on earth that can do such works and mighty acts (miracles) as Yours? 25‘I pray, let me go over and see the good land that is beyond the Jordan, that good hill country [with Hermon] and Lebanon.’ 26But the LORD was angry with me because of you [and your rebellion at Meribah], and would not listen to me; and the LORD said to me, ‘Enough! Speak to Me no longer about this matter. 27‘Go up to the top of [Mount] Pisgah and raise your eyes toward the west and north and south and east, and see it with your eyes, for you shall not cross this Jordan. 28‘But command Joshua and encourage and strengthen him, for he shall go across and lead this people, and he will give them the land which you see as an inheritance.’ 29So we stayed in the Valley opposite Beth-peor.\n\nDeuteronomy 4\nIsrael Urged To Obey God’s Law\n\n1“Now, O Israel, listen and pay attention to the statutes and the judgments (God’s legal decisions) which I am teaching you to do, so that you may live and go in and take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, is giving you. 2You shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it, so that you may keep the commandments of the LORD your God which I am commanding you. 3Your eyes have seen what the LORD did at Baal-peor; for all the men who followed [and participated in the worship of] Baal of Peor, the LORD your God destroyed them from among you, 4but you who held tightly to the LORD your God are alive today, every one of you.\n\n5“Look, I have taught you statutes and judgments just as the LORD my God has commanded me, so that you may do them in the land which you are entering to possess. 6So keep and do them, for that is your wisdom and your understanding in the sight of the peoples who will hear all these statutes and say, ‘Surely this great nation is a wise and understanding people.’ 7For what great nation is there that has a god so near to it as the LORD our God [is to us] whenever we call on Him? 8Or what great nation has statutes and judgments so righteous (upright, just) as this whole law which I am placing before you today?\n\n9“Only pay attention and watch yourselves closely so that you do not forget the things which your eyes have seen and they do not depart from your heart all the days of your life. Make them known to your children and your grandchildren [impressing these things on their mind and penetrating their heart with these truths]— 10especially the day you stood before the LORD your God at Horeb (Mount Sinai), when the LORD said to me, ‘Assemble the people to Me and I will let them hear My words, so that they may learn to fear Me [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect] all the days they live on the land, and so that they may teach their children.’ 11You approached and stood at the foot of the mountain, and the mountain burned with fire to the [very] heart of the heavens: darkness, cloud and thick gloom. 12Then the LORD spoke to you from the midst of the fire; you heard the sound of the words, but you saw no form—there was only a voice. 13So He declared to you His covenant which He commanded you to follow, the Ten Commandments; and He wrote them on two tablets of stone. 14The LORD commanded me at that time to teach you the statutes and judgments, so that you might do them in the land which you are going over to possess.\n\n15“So pay attention and watch yourselves carefully—for you did not see any form [of God] on the day the LORD spoke to you at Horeb from the midst of the fire— 16so that you do not act corruptly and make for yourselves a carved or sculpted image [to worship] in the form of any figure, the likeness of male or female, 17the likeness of any animal that is on the earth, or of any winged bird that flies in the sky, 18the likeness of anything that crawls on the ground, or of any fish that is in the waters beneath the earth. 19And beware that you do not raise your eyes toward heaven and see the sun and the moon and the stars, all the host of heaven, and let yourselves be led astray and worship them and serve them, [mere created bodies] which the LORD your God has allotted to [serve and benefit] all the peoples under the whole heaven. 20But the LORD has taken you and brought you out of the iron [smelting] furnace, out of Egypt, to be a people for His own possession, as [you are] this day.\n\n21“Now the LORD was angry with me [at the waters of Meribah] because of you, and He swore [an oath] that I would not cross the Jordan, and that I would not enter the good land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance. 22For I am going to die in this land, I am not going to cross the Jordan, but you shall cross over and take possession of this good land. 23So be on your guard and watch yourselves, so that you do not forget the covenant of the LORD your God which He has made with you, and make for yourselves a carved or sculpted image in the form of anything which the LORD your God has forbidden you. 24For the LORD your God is a consuming fire; He is a jealous (impassioned) God [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely His].\n\n25“When you become the father of children and grandchildren and have grown old in the land, then if you corrupt yourselves by making a carved or sculpted image in the form of anything [for the purpose of worship], and do evil [things] in the sight of the LORD your God, provoking Him to anger, 26I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that you will soon utterly perish from the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess. You shall not live long on it, but will be utterly destroyed. 27The LORD will scatter and disperse you among the peoples (pagan nations), and you will be left few in number among the nations where the LORD drives you. 28And there you will serve [false and foreign] gods, the work of human hands, [lifeless images of] wood and stone, which neither see nor hear nor eat nor smell [the offerings of food given to them]. 29But from there you will seek the LORD your God, and you will find Him if you search for Him with all your heart and all your soul. 30When you are in distress and tribulation and all these things come on you, in the latter days you will return to the LORD your God and listen to His voice. 31For the LORD your God is a merciful and compassionate God; He will not fail you, nor destroy you, nor forget the covenant with your fathers which He swore to them.\n\n32“Indeed, ask now about the days that are past, [those days] which were before you, since the day that God created man on the earth, and ask from one end of the heavens to the other. Has anything been done like this great thing, or has anything been heard like it? 33Did [any] people ever hear the voice of God speaking out of the midst of the fire, as you heard, and [still] live? 34Or has any [man-made] god ever tried to go and take for himself a nation from within another nation by trials, by signs and wonders and by war and by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm and by great terrors, as the LORD your God did for you in Egypt before your [very] eyes? 35It was shown to you so that you might have [personal] knowledge and comprehend that the LORD is God; there is no other besides Him. 36Out of the heavens He let you hear His voice to discipline and admonish you; and on earth He let you see His great fire, and you heard His words from the midst of the fire. 37And because He loved your fathers, He chose their descendants who followed them, and brought you from Egypt with His Presence, with His great and awesome power, 38dispossessing and driving out from before you nations, [nations that were] greater and mightier than you, to bring you in, to give you their land as an inheritance, as it is this day. 39Therefore know and understand today, and take it to your heart, that the LORD is God in the heavens above and on the earth below; there is no other. 40“So you shall keep His statutes and His commandments which I am commanding you today, so that it may go well with you and with your children after you, and so that you may live long on the land which the LORD your God is giving you for all time.”\n\n41Then Moses set apart three cities [of refuge] beyond the Jordan toward the rising of the sun (eastward), 42so that someone who committed manslaughter could flee there, [that is, a person] who killed his neighbor unintentionally and without previously having hostility toward him, and that by escaping to one of these cities he might [claim the right of asylum and] save his life: 43Bezer in the wilderness on the plateau for the Reubenites, and Ramoth in Gilead for the Gadites, and Golan in Bashan for the Manassites.\n\n44This is the law which Moses placed before the sons of Israel; 45these are the testimonies (legal provisions) and the statutes and the judgments which Moses spoke to the sons of Israel when they came out of Egypt, 46beyond the Jordan in the Valley opposite Beth-peor, in the land of Sihon king of the Amorites who lived at Heshbon, whom Moses and the sons of Israel defeated when they came out from Egypt. 47They took possession of his land and the land of Og king of Bashan, the two kings of the Amorites, who reigned across the Jordan to the east, 48from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, as far as Mount Sion (that is, Hermon), 49with all the Arabah (desert lowlands) across the Jordan to the east, even as far as the sea of the Arabah (the Dead Sea), at the foot of the slopes of Pisgah.\n\nDeuteronomy 5\nThe Ten Commandments Repeated\n\n1Then Moses summoned all Israel and said to them:\n\n“Hear, O Israel, the statutes and judgments (legal decisions) which I am speaking today in your hearing, so that you may learn them and observe them carefully. 2The LORD our God made a covenant with us at Horeb. 3The LORD did not make this covenant with our fathers, but with us, all of us who are alive here today. 4The LORD spoke with you face to face at the mountain from the midst of the fire. 5I was standing between the LORD and you at that time, to declare to you the word of the LORD; for you were afraid because of the fire and did not go up the mountain. He said,\n\n6‘I am the LORD your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery.\n\n7‘You shall have no other gods before Me.\n\n8‘You shall not make for yourself an idol [as an object to worship], or any likeness (form, manifestation) of what is in heaven above or on the earth beneath or in the water under the earth. 9‘You shall not worship them or serve them; for I, the LORD your God, am a jealous (impassioned) God [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely mine], visiting (avenging) the iniquity (sin, guilt) of the fathers on the children [that is, calling the children to account for the sins of their fathers], to the third and the fourth generations of those who hate Me, 10but showing graciousness and lovingkindness to thousands [of generations] of those who love Me and keep My commandments.\n\n11‘You shall not take the name of the LORD your God in vain [that is, irreverently, in false affirmations or in ways that impugn the character of God]; for the LORD will not hold guiltless nor leave unpunished the one who takes His name in vain [disregarding its reverence and its power].\n\n12‘Observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy (set apart, dedicated to God), as the LORD your God commanded you. 13‘Six days you shall labor and do all your work, 14but the seventh day is a Sabbath [a day of rest dedicated] to the LORD your God; on that day you shall not do any work, you or your son or your daughter or your male servant or your female servant or your ox or your donkey or any of your livestock or the stranger who stays inside your [city] gates, so that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. 15‘You shall remember [with thoughtful concern] that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and that the LORD your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm; therefore the LORD your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day.\n\n16‘Honor (respect, obey, care for) your father and your mother, as the LORD your God has commanded you, so that your days [on the earth] may be prolonged and so that it may go well with you in the land which the LORD your God gives you.\n\n17‘You shall not murder.\n\n18‘You shall not commit adultery.\n\n19‘You shall not steal.\n\n20‘You shall not give false testimony [that is, lie, withhold, or manipulate the truth] against your neighbor (any person).\n\n21‘You shall not covet [that is, desire and seek to acquire] your neighbor’s wife, nor desire your neighbor’s house, his field, his male servant or his female servant, his ox or his donkey or anything that belongs to your neighbor.’\n\nMoses Interceded 22“The LORD spoke these words with a great voice to all your assembly at the mountain out of the midst of the fire, the cloud, and the thick darkness, and He added no more. He wrote these commandments on two tablets of stone and gave them to me. 23And when you heard the voice from the midst of the darkness, while the mountain was burning with fire, you approached me, all the leaders (heads) of your tribes and your elders; 24and you said, ‘Behold, the LORD our God has shown us His glory and His greatness, and we have heard His voice from the midst of the fire; we have seen today that God speaks with man, yet he [still] lives. 25‘Now then why should we die? For this great fire will consume us; if we hear the voice of the LORD our God any longer, then we will die. 26‘For who is there of all flesh (mankind) who has heard the voice of the living God speaking from the midst of the fire, as we have, and lived? 27‘You, Moses, go near and listen to everything that the LORD our God says; then speak to us everything that the LORD our God speaks to you, and we will listen and do it.’\n\n28“The LORD heard your words when you spoke to me, and the LORD said to me, ‘I have heard the words of this people which they have spoken to you. They have done well in all that they have spoken. 29‘Oh that they had such a heart in them, that they would fear [and worship Me with awe-filled reverence and profound respect] and keep all My commandments always, so that it may go well with them and with their children forever! 30‘Go and say to them, “Return to your tents.” 31‘But as for you, stand here by Me, and I will tell you all the commandments and the statutes and the judgments which you shall teach them, so that they may obey them in the land which I give them to possess.’ 32Therefore you shall pay attention and be careful to do just as the LORD your God has commanded you; you shall not turn aside to the right or to the left [deviating from My commandments]. 33You shall walk [that is, live each and every day] in all the ways which the LORD your God has commanded you, so that you may live and so that it may be well with you, and that you may live long in the land which you will possess.\n\nDeuteronomy 6\nObey God And Prosper\n\n1“Now this is the command; the statutes and the judgments (precepts) which the LORD your God has commanded me to teach you, so that you might do (follow, obey) them in the land which you are crossing over [the Jordan] to possess, 2so that you and your son and your grandson may fear and worship the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect], to keep [and actively do] all His statutes and His commandments which I am commanding you, all the days of your life, so that your days may be prolonged. 3Therefore listen, O Israel, and be careful to do them, that it may go well with you and that you may increase greatly [in numbers], as the LORD, the God of your fathers, has promised you, in a land flowing with milk and honey.\n\n4“Hear, O Israel! The LORD is our God, the LORD is one [the only God]! 5You shall love the LORD your God with all your heart and mind and with all your soul and with all your strength [your entire being]. 6These words, which I am commanding you today, shall be [written] on your heart and mind. 7You shall teach them diligently to your children [impressing God’s precepts on their minds and penetrating their hearts with His truths] and shall speak of them when you sit in your house and when you walk on the road and when you lie down and when you get up. 8And you shall bind them as a sign on your hand (forearm), and they shall be used as bands (frontals, frontlets) on your forehead. 9You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates.\n\n10“Then it shall come about when the LORD your God brings you into the land which He swore (solemnly promised) to [give] your fathers—to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob—to give you, [a land with] great and splendid cities which you did not build, 11and houses full of all good things which you did not fill, and hewn (excavated) cisterns (wells) which you did not dig out, and vineyards and olive trees which you did not plant, and you eat and are full and satisfied, 12then beware that you do not forget the LORD who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 13You shall fear [only] the LORD your God; and you shall serve Him [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect] and swear [oaths] by His name [alone]. 14You shall not follow other gods, any of the gods of the peoples who surround you, 15for the LORD your God who is among you is a jealous (impassioned) God [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely His]—otherwise the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled and burn against you, and He will destroy you from the face of the earth.\n\n16“You shall not put the LORD your God to the test, as you tested Him at Massah. 17You shall diligently keep [foremost in your thoughts and actively do] the commandments of the LORD your God, and His testimonies and His statutes which He has commanded you. 18You shall do what is right and good in the sight of the LORD, so that it may be well with you and that you may go in and possess the good land which the LORD swore to [give] your fathers, 19by driving out all your enemies from before you, as the LORD has spoken.\n\n20“When your son asks you in time to come, saying, ‘What is the meaning of the testimonies and statutes and judgments (precepts) which the LORD our God has commanded you?’ 21then you shall say to your son, ‘We were Pharaoh’s slaves in Egypt, and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand. 22‘Moreover, the LORD showed great and terrible signs and wonders before our eyes against Egypt, Pharaoh and all his household; 23He brought us out from there in order to bring us in, to give us the land which He had sworn to [give] our fathers.’ 24So the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes, to fear [and worship] the LORD our God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect] for our good always and so that He might preserve us alive, as it is today. 25It will be [considered] righteousness for us [that is, right standing with God] if we are careful to observe all this commandment before the LORD our God—just as He has commanded us.\n\nDeuteronomy 7\nWarnings\n\n1“When the LORD your God brings you into the land which you are entering to possess, and has cleared away many nations before you, the Hittite and the Girgashite and the Amorite and the Canaanite and the Perizzite and the Hivite and the Jebusite, seven nations greater and mightier than you, 2and when the LORD your God gives them over to you and you defeat them, then you shall utterly destroy them. You shall not make a covenant (treaty) with them nor show mercy and compassion to them. 3You shall not intermarry with them; you shall not give your daughter to his son, nor shall you take his daughter for your son; 4for they will turn your sons away from following Me to serve other gods; then the anger of the LORD will be kindled and burn against you and He will quickly destroy you. 5But this is how you shall deal with them: you shall tear down their altars and smash to pieces their sacred pillars, and cut down their Asherim (symbols of the goddess Asherah), and burn their carved or sculpted images in the fire. 6For you are a holy people [set apart] to the LORD your God; the LORD your God has chosen you out of all the peoples on the face of the earth to be a people for His own possession [that is, His very special treasure].\n\n7“The LORD did not love you and choose you because you were greater in number than any of the other peoples, for you were the fewest of all peoples. 8But because the LORD loves you and is keeping the oath which He swore to your fathers, the LORD has brought you out with a mighty hand and redeemed (bought) you from the house of slavery, from the hand of Pharaoh king of Egypt. 9Therefore know [without any doubt] and understand that the LORD your God, He is God, the faithful God, who is keeping His covenant and His [steadfast] lovingkindness to a thousand generations with those who love Him and keep His commandments; 10but repays those who hate Him to their faces, by destroying them; He will not hesitate with him who hates Him, He will repay him to his face. 11Therefore, you shall keep (follow, obey) the commandment and the statutes and judgments (precepts) which I am commanding you today.\n\nPromises of God 12“Then it shall come about, because you listen to these judgments and keep and do them, that the LORD your God will keep with you the covenant and the [steadfast] lovingkindness which He swore to your fathers. 13He will love you and bless you and multiply you; He will also bless the fruit of your womb and the fruit of your land, your grain and your new wine and your [olive] oil, the offspring of your cattle and the young of your flock, in the land which He swore to your fathers to give you. 14You shall be blessed above all peoples; there will be no male or female barren (childless, infertile) among you or among your cattle. 15The LORD will take away from you all sickness; and He will not subject you to any of the harmful diseases of Egypt which you have known, but He will impose them on all [those] who hate you. 16And you shall consume all the peoples whom the LORD your God will give over to you; your eye shall not pity them, nor shall you serve their gods, for that would be a [deadly] trap to you.\n\n17“If you say in your heart, ‘These nations are greater than I am; how can I dispossess them?’ 18you shall not be afraid of them; you shall remember [with confidence] what the LORD your God did to Pharaoh and to all Egypt— 19the great trials which you saw with your own eyes, and the signs, the wonders, the mighty hand and the outstretched arm by which the LORD your God brought you out. So shall the LORD your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid. 20Moreover, the LORD your God will send the hornet (His terror) against them, until those who are left and hide themselves from you perish. 21You shall not dread them, for the LORD your God is in your midst, a great and awesome God. 22The LORD your God will clear away these nations before you little by little; you will not be able to put an end to them quickly, for [if you did] the wild animals would become too numerous for you. 23But the LORD your God will hand them over to you, and will confuse them with a great panic until they are destroyed. 24And He will hand over their kings to you, and you will make their name perish from under heaven; no man will be able to stand before you until you have destroyed them. 25You shall burn the carved and sculpted images of their gods in the fire. You shall not covet the silver or gold that is on them, nor take it for yourselves, so that you will not be ensnared by it [in a deadly trap], for it is an abomination (repulsive) to the LORD your God. 26You shall not bring an abomination (idol) into your house, and like it come under the ban (doomed to destruction); you shall utterly detest and you shall utterly hate it, for it is something banned.\nDeuteronomy 8\nGod’s Gracious Dealings\n\n1“Every commandment that I am commanding you today you shall be careful to do, so that you may live and multiply, and go in and possess the land which the LORD swore [to give] to your fathers. 2And you shall remember [always] all the ways which the LORD your God has led you these forty years in the wilderness, so that He might humble you and test you, to know what was in your heart (mind), whether you would keep His commandments or not. 3He humbled you and allowed you to be hungry and fed you with manna, [a substance] which you did not know, nor did your fathers know, so that He might make you understand [by personal experience] that man does not live by bread alone, but man lives by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of the LORD. 4Your clothing did not wear out on you, nor did your feet swell these forty years. 5Therefore, know in your heart (be fully cognizant) that the LORD your God disciplines and instructs you just as a man disciplines and instructs his son. 6Therefore, you shall keep the commandments of the LORD your God, to walk [that is, to live each and every day] in His ways and fear [and worship] Him [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect]. 7For the LORD your God is bringing you into a good land, a land of brooks of water, of fountains and springs, flowing forth in valleys and hills; 8a land of wheat and barley, and vines and fig trees and pomegranates, a land of olive oil and honey; 9a land where you will eat bread without shortage, in which you will lack nothing; a land whose stones are iron, and out of whose hills you can dig copper. 10When you have eaten and are satisfied, then you shall bless the LORD your God for the good land which He has given you.\n\n11“Beware that you do not forget the LORD your God by failing to keep His commandments and His judgments (precepts) and His statutes which I am commanding you today; 12otherwise, when you have eaten and are satisfied, and have built good houses and lived in them, 13and when your herds and flocks multiply, and your silver and gold multiply, and all that you have increases, 14then your heart will become lifted up [by self-conceit and arrogance] and you will forget the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. 15He led you through the great and terrible wilderness, with its fiery serpents and scorpions and thirsty ground where there was no water; it was He who brought water for you out of the flinty rock. 16He fed you manna in the wilderness, [a substance] which your fathers did not know, so that He might humble you [by dependence on Him] and that He might test you, to do good [things] for you at the end. 17Otherwise, you may say in your heart, ‘My power and the strength of my hand made me this wealth.’ 18But you shall remember [with profound respect] the LORD your God, for it is He who is giving you power to make wealth, that He may confirm His covenant which He swore (solemnly promised) to your fathers, as it is this day. 19And it shall come about if you ever forget the LORD your God and follow other gods and serve them and worship them, I testify against you today that you will most certainly perish. 20Like the nations which the LORD causes to perish before you, so shall you perish; because you would not listen to and obey the voice of the LORD your God.\n\nDeuteronomy 9\nIsrael Provoked God\n\n1“Hear, O Israel! You are crossing the Jordan today to go in to dispossess nations greater and more powerful than you, great cities fortified to heaven, 2a people great and tall, sons of Anakim, whom you know and of whom you have heard it said, ‘Who can stand before the sons of Anak?’ 3So know today [with confident assurance] that the LORD your God is crossing [the Jordan] before you like a devouring fire. He will destroy them and He will subdue them before you, and you shall drive them out and destroy them quickly, just as the LORD has promised you.\n\n4“Do not say in your heart when the LORD your God has driven them out before you, ‘Because of my righteousness the LORD has brought me in to possess this land,’ but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD is dispossessing them before you. 5It is not for your righteousness or for the uprightness of your heart that you are going to possess their land, but because of the wickedness of these nations the LORD your God is driving them out before you, and to confirm the oath which the LORD swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n\n6“Know [without any doubt], that the LORD your God is not giving you this good land to possess because of your righteousness, for you are a stiff-necked (stubborn, obstinate) people. 7Remember [with remorse] and do not forget how you provoked the LORD your God to wrath in the wilderness; from the day you left the land of Egypt until you arrived in this place, you have been rebellious against the LORD. 8And at Horeb (Sinai) you provoked the LORD to wrath, and the LORD was so angry with you that He would have destroyed you. 9When I went up the mountain to receive the tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant which the LORD made with you, I remained on the mountain forty days and forty nights; I did not eat food or drink water. 10The LORD gave me the two tablets of stone written with the finger of God; and on them were written all the words which the LORD had spoken to you at the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly. 11It came about at the end of forty days and forty nights that the LORD gave me the two tablets of stone, the tablets of the covenant. 12Then the LORD said to me, ‘Arise, go down from here quickly, for your people whom you brought from Egypt have acted corruptly. They have quickly turned aside from the way which I commanded them; they have made (cast) a molten image for themselves.’ 13Furthermore, the LORD said to me, ‘I have seen this people, and indeed, they are stiff-necked (stubborn, obstinate) people. 14‘Let Me alone, so that I may destroy them and wipe out their name from under heaven; and I will make of you a nation mightier and greater than they.’\n\n15“So I turned and came down from the mountain while the mountain was burning with fire, and the two tablets of the covenant were in my two hands. 16And I saw that you had indeed sinned against the LORD your God. You had made for yourselves a molten calf (idol). You had turned aside quickly from the way which the LORD had commanded you. 17So I took hold of the two tablets and threw them from my two hands and smashed them before your very eyes! 18Then, as before, I fell down before the LORD for [another] forty days and forty nights; I did not eat food or drink water, because of all the sin you had committed by doing what was evil in the sight of the LORD to provoke Him to anger. 19For I was afraid of the anger and absolute fury which the LORD held against you, [enough divine fury] to destroy you, but the LORD listened to me that time also. 20The LORD was very angry with Aaron, angry [enough] to destroy him, so I also prayed for Aaron at the same time. 21I took your sinful thing, the calf which you had made, and burned it in the fire and thoroughly crushed it, grinding the metal thoroughly until it was as fine as dust; and I threw its dust into the brook that came down from the mountain.\n\n22“At Taberah also and at Massah and at Kibroth-hattaavah you provoked the LORD to wrath. 23And when the LORD sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, ‘Go up and take possession of the land which I have given you,’ then you rebelled against the command of the LORD your God, and you did not believe and rely on Him, nor did you obey His voice. 24You have been rebellious against the LORD from the [first] day that I knew you.\n\n25“So I fell down and lay face down before the LORD forty days and nights because the LORD had said He would destroy you. 26Then I prayed to the LORD and said, ‘O Lord GOD, do not destroy Your people, even Your inheritance, whom You have redeemed through Your greatness, whom You have brought from Egypt with a mighty hand. 27‘Remember [with compassion] Your servants, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob; do not look at the stubbornness of this people or at their wickedness or at their sin, 28so that the [people of the] land from which You brought us will not say, “Because the LORD was not capable of bringing them into the land which He had promised them and because He hated them He has brought them out to the wilderness [in order] to kill them.” 29‘Yet they are Your people and Your inheritance, whom You have brought out by Your great power and by Your outstretched arm.’\n\nDeuteronomy 10\nThe Tablets Rewritten\n\n1“At that time the LORD said to me, ‘Cut out for yourself two tablets of stone like the first, and come up to Me on the mountain, and make an ark (chest) of wood for yourself. 2‘I will write on the tablets the words that were on the first tablets which you shattered, and you shall put them in the ark.’ 3So I made an ark of acacia wood and cut out two tablets of stone like the first, and went up the mountain with the two tablets in my hand. 4The LORD wrote on the tablets, like the first writing, the Ten Commandments which the LORD had spoken to you on the mountain from the midst of the fire on the day of the assembly; then the LORD gave them to me. 5“Then I turned and came down from the mountain and put the tablets in the ark which I had made; and they are there, just as the LORD commanded me.”\n\n6(Now the sons of Israel traveled from the wells of the sons of Jaakan to Moserah. There Aaron died and there he was buried and Eleazar his son ministered as priest in his place. 7From there they traveled to Gudgodah, and from Gudgodah to Jotbathah, a land of brooks of water. 8At that time the LORD set apart the tribe of Levi to carry the ark of the covenant of the LORD, to stand before the LORD to serve Him and to bless in His name until this day. 9Therefore, Levi does not have a portion or inheritance [of tribal land] with his brothers; the LORD is his inheritance, as the LORD your God has promised him.)\n\n10“And I stayed on the mountain, like the first time, forty days and nights, and the LORD listened to me at that time also; the LORD was not willing to destroy you. 11Then the LORD said to me, ‘Arise, go on your journey ahead of the people, so that they may go in and take possession of the land which I swore to their fathers to give to them.’\n\n12“And now, Israel, what does the LORD your God require from you, but to fear [and worship] the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect], to walk [that is, to live each and every day] in all His ways and to love Him, and to serve the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul [your choices, your thoughts, your whole being], 13and to keep the commandments of the LORD and His statutes which I am commanding you today for your good? 14Behold, the heavens and the highest of heavens belong to the LORD your God, the earth and all that is in it. 15Yet the LORD had a delight in loving your fathers and set His affection on them, and He chose their descendants after them, you above all peoples, as it is this day. 16So circumcise [that is, remove sin from] your heart, and be stiff-necked (stubborn, obstinate) no longer. 17For the LORD your God is the God of gods and the Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, the awesome God who does not show partiality nor take a bribe. 18He executes justice for the orphan and the widow, and shows His love for the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) by giving him food and clothing. 19Therefore, show your love for the stranger, for you were strangers in the land of Egypt. 20You shall fear [and worship] the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect]; you shall serve Him and cling to Him [hold tightly to Him, be united with Him], and you shall swear [oaths] by His name. 21He is your praise and glory; He is your God, who has done for you these great and awesome things which you have seen with your own eyes. 22Your fathers went down to Egypt, seventy persons [in all], and now the LORD your God has made you as numerous as the stars of heaven.\n\nDeuteronomy 11\nRewards Of Obedience\n\n1“Therefore you shall love the LORD your God, and always keep His charge, His statutes, His precepts, and His commandments [it is your obligation to Him]. 2Know this day that I am not speaking to your children who have not known [by personal experience] and who have not seen [firsthand] the instruction and discipline of the LORD your God—His greatness, His mighty hand and His outstretched arm; 3and His signs and His works which He did in the midst of Egypt to Pharaoh the king of Egypt and to all his land; 4and what He did to the army of Egypt, to its horses and its chariots, when He made the water of the Red Sea engulf them as they pursued you, and how the LORD completely destroyed them; 5and what He did to you in the wilderness until you came to this place; 6and what He did to Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab, the son of Reuben, when the earth opened its mouth and swallowed them, their households, their tents, and every living thing that followed them, in the midst of all Israel. 7For your eyes have seen all the great work of the LORD which He did.\n\n8“Therefore, you shall keep all the commandments which I am commanding you today, so that you may be strong and go in and take possession of the land which you are crossing over [the Jordan] to possess; 9so that you may live long on the land which the LORD swore (solemnly promised) to your fathers to give to them and to their descendants, a land [of great abundance,] flowing with milk and honey. 10For the land which you are entering to possess is not like the land of Egypt from which you have come, where you sowed your seed and watered it with your foot like a garden of vegetables. 11But the land into which you are about to cross to possess, a land of hills and valleys, drinks water from the rain of heaven, 12a land for which the LORD your God cares; the eyes of the LORD your God are always on it, from the beginning of the year to the end of the year.\n\n13“It shall come about, if you listen obediently and pay attention to My commandments which I command you today—to love the LORD your God and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul [your choices, your thoughts, your whole being]— 14that He will give the rain for your land in its season, the early [fall] rain and the late [spring] rain, so that you may gather in your grain and your new wine and your [olive] oil. 15And He will give grass in your fields for your cattle, and you will eat and be satisfied. 16Beware that your hearts are not deceived, and that you do not turn away [from the LORD] and serve other gods and worship them, 17or [else] the LORD’S anger will be kindled and burn against you, and He will shut up the heavens so that there will be no rain and the land will not yield its fruit; and you will perish quickly from the good land which the LORD is giving you.\n\n18“Therefore, you shall impress these words of mine on your heart and on your soul, and tie them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as bands (frontals, frontlets) on your forehead. 19You shall teach them [diligently] to your children [impressing God’s precepts on their minds and penetrating their hearts with His truths], speaking of them when you sit in your house and when you walk along the road and when you lie down and when you rise up. 20You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates, 21so that your days and the days of your children may be multiplied in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give them, as long as the heavens are above the earth. 22For if you are careful to keep all this commandment which I am commanding you to do, to love the LORD your God, to walk [that is, to live each and every day] in all His ways and to hold tightly to Him— 23then the LORD will drive out all these nations from before you, and you shall dispossess nations greater and mightier than you. 24Every place on which the sole of your foot treads shall become yours; your territory shall be from the wilderness to Lebanon, and from the river, the river Euphrates, as far as the western sea (the Mediterranean). 25No man will be able to stand before you; the LORD your God will lay the fear and the dread of you on all the land on which you set foot, just as He has spoken to you.\n\n26“Behold, today I am setting before you a blessing and a curse— 27the blessing, if you listen to and obey the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today; 28and the curse, if you do not listen to and obey the commandments of the LORD your God, but turn aside from the way which I am commanding you today, by following (acknowledging, worshiping) other gods which you have not known.\n\n29“It shall come about, when the LORD your God brings you into the land which you are entering to possess, that you shall place the blessing on Mount Gerizim and the curse on Mount Ebal. 30Are they not across the Jordan, west of the road, toward the sunset, in the land of the Canaanites who live in the Arabah, opposite Gilgal, beside the oaks of Moreh? 31For you are about to cross the Jordan to go in to possess the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you shall possess it and live in it, 32and you shall be careful to do all the statutes and the judgments which I am setting before you today.\n\nDeuteronomy 12\nLaws Of The Sanctuary\n\n1“These are the statutes and judgments (precepts) which you shall be careful to do in the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you to possess as long as you live on the earth. 2You shall utterly destroy all the places where the nations whom you shall dispossess serve their gods, on the high mountains and the hills and under every green [leafy] tree. 3You shall tear down their altars and smash their [idolatrous] pillars and burn their Asherim in the fire; you shall cut down the carved and sculpted images of their gods and obliterate their name from that place. 4You shall not act like this toward the LORD your God. 5But you shall seek the LORD at the place which the LORD your God will choose out of all your tribes to establish His Name there for His dwelling [place], and there you shall come [to worship Him]. 6There you shall bring your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes, the contribution of your hand, your votive (pledged, vowed) offerings, your freewill (voluntary) offerings, and the firstborn of your herd and of your flock. 7And there you and your households shall eat before the LORD your God, and rejoice in all to which you put your hand, in which the LORD your God has blessed you.\n\n8“You shall not do at all what we are doing here [in the camp] today, every man doing whatever is right in his [own] eyes. 9For you have not yet come to the resting place and to the inheritance which the LORD your God is giving you. 10When you cross the Jordan and live in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to inherit, and He gives you rest from all your enemies around you so that you live in security, 11then it shall come about that the place which the LORD your God will choose for His Name [and Presence] to dwell; there you shall bring everything that I am commanding you: your burnt offerings, your sacrifices, your tithes and the [voluntary] contribution of your hand [as a first gift from the fruits of the ground], and all your choice votive offerings which you vow to the LORD. 12And you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your sons and your daughters, and your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your [city] gates, since he has no portion or inheritance with you.\n\n13“Be careful that you do not offer your burnt offerings in every [cultic] place you see, 14but [only] in the place which the LORD will choose in one of your tribes, there you shall offer your burnt offerings, and there you shall do everything that I am commanding you.\n\n15“However, you may slaughter and eat meat within any of your [city] gates, whatever you wish, according to the blessing of the LORD your God which He has given you [as His generous provision for daily life]. The [ceremonially] unclean and the clean may eat it, such as the gazelle and the deer. 16Only you shall not eat the blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water. 17You are forbidden to eat within your [city] gates the tithe of your grain or new wine or oil, or the firstborn of your herd or flock, or any of your votive offerings, or your freewill offerings, or the contribution of your hand. 18But you shall eat them before the LORD your God in the place which the LORD your God will choose, you and your son and your daughter, and your male and female servants, and the Levite who is within your [city] gates; and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God in all that you undertake. 19Be careful that you do not neglect the Levite [who serves God] as long as you live in your land.\n\n20“When the LORD your God extends your territory, as He promised you, and you say, ‘I will eat meat,’ because you want to eat meat, then you may eat meat, whatever you wish. 21If the place which the LORD your God chooses to put His Name (Presence) is too far away from you, then you may slaughter [animals] from your herd or flock which the LORD has given you, just as I have commanded you; and you may eat within your [city] gates whatever you wish. 22Just as the gazelle or the deer is eaten, so you may eat it [but not make it an offering]; the [ceremonially] unclean and the clean alike may eat it. 23Only be sure that you do not eat the blood, for the blood is the life (soul), and you shall not eat the life with the meat. 24You shall not eat it; you shall pour it out on the ground like water. 25You shall not eat it, so that all may be well with you and with your children after you, because you will be doing what is right in the sight of the LORD. 26However, you shall take your holy things which you have [to offer] and your votive (pledged, vowed) offerings, you shall take them and go to the place which the LORD will choose. 27And you shall offer your burnt offerings, the meat and the blood, on the altar of the LORD your God; and the blood of your sacrifices shall be poured out on the altar of the LORD your God, and you shall eat the meat.\n\n28“Be careful to listen to all these words which I am commanding you, so that it may be well with you and with your children after you forever, because you will be doing what is good and right in the sight of the LORD your God.\n\n29“When the LORD your God cuts off and destroys before you the nations which you are going in to dispossess, and you dispossess them and settle in their land, 30beware that you are not lured (ensnared) into following them, after they have been destroyed before you, and that you do not inquire about their gods, saying, ‘How did these nations serve their gods, so that I too may do likewise?’ 31You shall not behave this way toward the LORD your God, for they have done for their gods every repulsive thing which the LORD hates; for they even burn their sons and their daughters in the fire [as sacrifices] to their gods.\n\n32“Everything I command you, you shall be careful to do it; you shall not add to it nor take away from it.\n\nDeuteronomy 13\nShun Idolatry\n\n1“If a prophet arises among you, or a dreamer of dreams, and gives you a sign or a wonder, 2and the sign or the wonder which he spoke (foretold) to you comes to pass, and if he says, ‘Let us follow after other gods (whom you have not known) and let us serve and worship them,’ 3you shall not listen to the words of that prophet or that dreamer of dreams; for the LORD your God is testing you to know whether you love the LORD your God with all your heart and mind and all your soul [your entire being]. 4You shall walk after the LORD your God and you shall fear [and worship] Him [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect], and you shall keep His commandments and you shall listen to His voice, and you shall serve Him, and cling to Him. 5But that prophet or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death, because he has counseled rebellion against the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt and redeemed you from the house of slavery, to draw you away from the way in which the LORD your God has commanded you to walk. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n\n6“If your brother, the son of your mother, or your son or daughter, or the wife you cherish, or your friend who is as [precious to you as] your own life (soul), entices you secretly, saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (gods whom neither you nor your fathers have known, 7of the gods of the peoples who are around you, near you or far from you, from one end of the earth to the other), 8you shall not consent to him or listen to him; and your eye shall not pity him, nor shall you spare him or conceal him. 9Instead, you shall most certainly execute him; your hand shall be first [to be raised] against him to put him to death, and afterwards the hand of all the people. 10So you shall stone him to death with stones, because he has tried to draw you away from the LORD your God who brought you from the land of Egypt, from the house of slavery. 11Then all Israel will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such a wicked thing among you.\n\n12“If you hear [it said] in one of your cities, which the LORD your God gives you to live in, 13that some worthless and evil men have gone out from among you and have tempted the inhabitants of their city [to sin], saying, ‘Let us go and serve other gods’ (whom you have not known), 14then you shall investigate and search out [witnesses] and ask thorough questions. If it is true and the matter is established that this loathsome thing has been done among you, 15you shall most certainly strike the inhabitants of that city with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying it and all that is in it, even its livestock with the edge of the sword. 16Then you shall collect all its spoil (plunder) into the middle of its open square and burn the city and set fire to the spoil as a whole burnt offering to the LORD your God. It shall be a ruin forever. It shall not be built again. 17Nothing from that which is put under the ban (designated for destruction) shall cling to your hand, so that the LORD may turn away from His burning anger and show mercy to you, and have compassion on you and make you increase, just as He swore to your fathers, 18because you have listened to and obeyed the voice of the LORD your God, keeping all His commandments which I am commanding you today, and doing what is right in the eyes of the LORD your God.\n\nDeuteronomy 14\nClean And Unclean Animals\n\n1“You are the sons of the LORD your God; you shall not cut yourselves nor shave your forehead for the sake of the dead, 2for you are a holy people [set apart] to the LORD your God; and the LORD has chosen you out of all the peoples who are on the earth to be a people for His own possession.\n\n3“You shall not eat anything that is detestable [to the LORD and forbidden by Him]. 4These are the animals that you may eat: the ox, the sheep, the goat, 5the deer, the gazelle, the roebuck, the wild goat, the ibex, the antelope and the mountain sheep. 6Among the animals, you may eat any animal that has the divided hoof [that is, a hoof] split into two parts [especially at its distal extremity] and that chews the cud. 7However, you are not to eat any of these [animals] among those which chew the cud, or among those that divide the hoof in two: the camel, the hare and the shaphan, for though they chew the cud, they do not split the hoof; they are unclean for you. 8The swine, because it has a divided hoof but does not chew the cud; it is unclean for you. You shall not eat their meat nor touch their carcasses.\n\n9“Of all [creatures] that are in the waters, you may eat these: anything that has fins and scales you may eat, 10but you may not eat anything that does not have fins and scales; it is unclean for you.\n\n11“You may eat any clean bird. 12But these are the ones which you shall not eat: the eagle, the vulture, and the black buzzard, 13and the red kite, the falcon, and the birds of prey of any variety, 14and every raven of any variety, 15and the ostrich, the owl, the seagull, the hawk of any variety, 16the little owl, the great owl, the long-eared owl, 17the pelican, the carrion vulture, the cormorant, 18the stork, and the heron of any variety, and the hoopoe, and the bat. 19And all flying insects are unclean for you; they shall not be eaten. 20You may eat any clean bird.\n\n21“You shall not eat anything that dies on its own. You may give it to the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) who is in your [city] gates, so that he may eat it, or you may sell it to a foreigner [since they are not under God’s law], but you are a people holy (set apart) to the LORD your God. You shall not boil a young goat or a lamb in its mother’s milk.\n\n22“Every year you shall certainly tithe [a tenth] of all the yield of your seed which is produced by your field. 23You shall eat the tithe (tenth) of your grain, your new wine, your oil, and the firstborn of your herd and your flock before the LORD your God in the place where He chooses to establish His Name (Presence), so that you may learn to fear [and worship] the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect] always. 24If the place where the LORD your God chooses to set His Name (Presence) is a great distance from you and you are not able to carry your tithe, because the LORD your God has blessed you [with such an abundance], 25then you shall exchange your tithe for money, and take the money in your hand and go to the place [of worship] which the LORD your God chooses. 26You may spend the money for anything your heart desires: for oxen, or sheep, or wine, or [other] strong drink, or anything else you want. You shall eat there in the presence of the LORD your God and rejoice, you and your household. 27Also you shall not neglect the Levite who is within your [city] gates, for he does not have a share [of land] or an inheritance among you.\n\n28“At the end of every third year you shall bring out all the tithe of your produce for that year, and shall store it up within your [city] gates. 29The Levite, because he has no share [of land] or an inheritance among you, and the stranger, and the orphan and the widow who are within your [city] gates, shall come and eat and be satisfied, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands.\n\nDeuteronomy 15\nThe Sabbatical Year\n\n1“At the end of every seven years you shall grant a release (remission, pardon) from debt. 2This is the regulation for the release: every creditor shall forgive what he has loaned to his neighbor; he shall not require repayment from his neighbor and his brother, because the LORD’S release has been proclaimed. 3You may require repayment from a foreigner, but whatever of yours is with your brother [Israelite] your hand shall release. 4However, there will be no poor among you, since the LORD will most certainly bless you in the land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance to possess, 5if only you will listen to and obey the voice of the LORD your God, to observe carefully all these commandments which I am commanding you today. 6When the LORD your God blesses you as He has promised you, then you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow; and you will rule over many nations, but they will not rule over you.\n\n7“If there is a poor man among you, one of your fellow Israelites, in any of your cities in the land that the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not be heartless, nor close-fisted with your poor brother; 8but you shall freely open your hand to him, and shall generously lend to him whatever he needs. 9Beware that there is no wicked thought in your heart, saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release (remission, pardon), is approaching,’ and your eye is hostile (unsympathetic) toward your poor brother, and you give him nothing [since he would not have to repay you]; for he may cry out to the LORD against you, and it will become a sin for you. 10You shall freely and generously give to him, and your heart shall not be resentful when you give to him, because for this [generous] thing the LORD your God will bless you in all your work and in all your undertakings. 11For the poor will never cease to be in the land; therefore I command you, saying, ‘You shall freely open your hand to your brother, to your needy, and to your poor in your land.’\n\n12“If your fellow Israelite, a Hebrew man or woman, is sold to you, and serves you for six years, then in the seventh year you shall set him free [from your service]. 13When you set him free, you shall not let him go away empty-handed. 14You shall give him generous provisions from your flock, from your threshing floor and from your wine press; you shall give to him as the LORD your God has blessed you. 15And you shall remember and thoughtfully consider that you were [once] a slave in the land of Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you; therefore, I am commanding you these things today. 16Now if the servant says to you, ‘I will not leave you,’ because he loves you and your household, since he is doing well with you; 17then take an awl and pierce it through his ear into the door, and he shall [willingly] be your servant always. Also you shall do the same for your maidservant.\n\n18“It shall not seem hard to you when you set him free, for he has served you six years with double the service of a hired man; so the LORD your God will bless you in everything you do.\n\n19“You shall consecrate (set apart) to the LORD your God all the firstborn males that are born of your herd and flock. You shall not work with the firstborn of your herd, nor shear the firstborn of your flock. 20You and your household shall eat it every year before the LORD your God in the place [for worship] which the LORD chooses. 21But if it has any defect or injury, such as lameness or blindness, or any serious defect, you shall not sacrifice it to the LORD your God. 22You shall eat it within your [city] gates; the [ceremonially] unclean and the clean alike may eat it, as [if it were] a gazelle or a deer. 23Only you shall not eat its blood; you are to pour it out on the ground like water.\n\nDeuteronomy 16\nThe Feast Of Passover\n\n1“Observe the month of Abib and celebrate the Passover to the LORD your God, for in the month of Abib the LORD your God brought you out of Egypt by night. 2You shall sacrifice the Passover [lamb] to the LORD your God from the flock or the herd, in the place where the LORD chooses to establish His Name (Presence). 3You shall not eat leavened bread with it; instead, for seven days you shall eat the Passover with unleavened bread, the bread of affliction (for you left the land of Egypt in haste); [do this] so that all the days of your life you may remember [thoughtfully] the day when you came out of the land of Egypt. 4For seven days no leaven shall be seen with you in all your territory, and none of the meat which you sacrificed the evening of the first day shall remain overnight until morning. 5You are not allowed to sacrifice the Passover [lamb] in any of your cities which the LORD your God is giving you; 6but at the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His Name (Presence), you shall sacrifice the Passover [lamb] in the evening at sunset, at the time that you came out of Egypt. 7You shall cook and eat it in the place which the LORD your God chooses. In the morning you are to return to your tents. 8For six days you shall eat unleavened bread, and on the seventh day there shall be a celebration to the LORD your God; so you shall do no work [on that day].\n\nThe Feast of Weeks 9“You shall count seven weeks for yourself; you shall begin to count seven weeks from the time you first put the sickle to the standing grain. 10Then you shall celebrate the Feast of Weeks to the LORD your God with a tribute of a freewill offering from your hand, which you shall give [to Him] just as the LORD your God blesses you; 11and you shall rejoice before the LORD your God, you and your son and your daughter and your male and female servants and the Levite who is within your [city] gates, and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are among you, at the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His Name (Presence). 12You shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and you shall be careful to obey these statutes.\n\nThe Feast of Booths 13“You shall celebrate the Feast of Booths (Tabernacles) seven days, when you have gathered in [the grain] from your threshing floor and [the wine] from your wine vat. 14You shall rejoice in your feast, you and your son and your daughter and your male and female servants and the Levite and the stranger and the orphan and the widow who are within your city. 15Seven days you shall celebrate a feast to the LORD your God in the place which the LORD chooses, because the LORD your God will bless you in all your produce and in all the work of your hands, so that you will be altogether joyful.\n\n16“Three times a year all your males shall appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, at the Feast of Unleavened Bread (Passover) and at the Feast of Weeks (Pentecost) and at the Feast of Booths (Tabernacles), and they shall not appear before the LORD empty-handed. 17Every man shall give as he is able, in accordance with the blessing which the LORD your God has given you.\n\n18“You shall appoint judges and officers in all your cities (gates) which the LORD your God is giving you, according to your tribes, and they shall judge the people with righteous judgment. 19You shall not distort justice; you shall not be partial, and you shall not take a bribe, for a bribe blinds the eyes of the wise and perverts the words of the righteous. 20You shall pursue justice, and only justice [that which is uncompromisingly righteous], so that you may live and take possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving you.\n\n21“You shall not plant for yourself an Asherah of any kind of tree or wood beside the altar of the LORD your God, which you shall make. 22You shall not set up for yourself a sacred pillar which the LORD your God hates.\n\nDeuteronomy 17\nAdministration Of Justice\n\n1“You shall not sacrifice to the LORD your God an ox or sheep with a blemish or any defect, for that is a detestable thing to the LORD your God.\n\n2“If there is discovered among you, within any of your cities, which the LORD your God is giving you, a man or a woman who does evil in the sight of the LORD your God, by transgressing (violating) His covenant, 3and has gone and served other gods and worshiped them, or the sun or the moon or any of the heavenly host, [doing these things] which I have commanded not to do, 4and if it is told to you and you hear about it, then you shall investigate thoroughly [all the charges]. If it is confirmed beyond doubt that this detestable thing has been done in Israel, 5then you shall bring that man or that woman who has done this evil thing to the gates [of your city] and you shall stone the man or the woman to death. 6On the evidence of two or three witnesses, he who is to die shall be put to death; he shall not be put to death on the evidence of [only] one witness. 7The hand of the witnesses shall be the first against him to put him to death, and afterward the hand of all the people. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n\n8“If any case is too difficult for you to judge—between one kind of homicide and another, between one kind of lawsuit and another, between one kind of assault and another, being controversial issues in your courts—then you shall arise and go to the place which the LORD your God chooses. 9So you shall come to the Levitical priests or to the judge who is in office at that time, and you shall consult them and they will declare to you the verdict in the case. 10You shall act in accordance with the terms of the verdict which they declare to you from that place which the LORD chooses. You shall be careful to act in accordance with all of their instructions. 11You shall act in accordance with the law which they teach you and the judgment which they tell you. You shall not turn aside from their verdict, to the right or to the left. 12The man who acts presumptuously and insolently by not listening to the priest who stands there to serve the LORD your God, nor to the judge, that man shall die; so you shall remove the evil from Israel. 13Then all the people will hear and be afraid, and will not act presumptuously again.\n\n14“When you enter the land which the LORD your God is giving you, and you take possession of it and live there, and you say, ‘I will set a king over me like all the nations who are around me,’ 15you shall most certainly set a king over you whom the LORD your God chooses. You shall set a king over you from among your countrymen (brothers); you may not choose a foreigner [to rule] over you who is not your countryman. 16Further, he shall not acquire many [war] horses for himself, nor make the people return to Egypt in order to acquire horses [to expand his military power], since the LORD said to you, ‘You shall never return that way again.’ 17He shall not acquire multiple wives for himself, or else his heart will turn away [from God]; nor [for the same reason] shall he acquire great amounts of silver and gold.\n\n18“Now it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. 19And it shall be with him and he shall read it all the days of his life, so that he may learn to fear [and worship] the LORD his God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect], by carefully obeying (keeping foremost in his thoughts and actively doing) all the words of this law and these statutes, 20so that his heart will not be lifted up above his countrymen [by a false sense of self-importance and self-reliance] and that he will not turn away (deviate) from the commandment, to the right or to the left, so that he and his sons may continue [to reign] for a long time in his kingdom in Israel.\n\nDeuteronomy 18\nPortion Of The Levites\n\n1“The Levitical priests, the entire tribe of Levi, shall own [privately] no portion [of land] or inheritance with Israel; they shall eat the LORD’S offerings by fire and His portion. 2They shall have no inheritance [of land] among their countrymen (brothers, brethren); the LORD is their inheritance, as He promised them.\n\n3“Now this shall be the priests’ portion from the people, from those offering a sacrifice, either an ox or a sheep: they shall give to the priest the shoulder and the two cheeks and the stomach. 4You shall also give him the first fruits of your grain, your new wine [the first of the season], and your [olive] oil, and the first sheared fleece of your sheep. 5For the LORD your God has chosen him, him and his sons from all your tribes, to stand and serve in the name of the LORD forever.\n\n6“Now if a Levite comes from any of your cities throughout Israel where he resides, and comes whenever he wishes to [the sanctuary] the place which the LORD chooses; 7then he shall serve in the name of the LORD his God, like all his fellow Levites who stand there before the LORD. 8They shall have equal portions to eat, except what they receive from the sale of their fathers’ estates.\n\nSpiritism Forbidden 9“When you enter the land which the LORD your God is giving you, you shall not learn to imitate the detestable (repulsive) practices of those nations. 10There shall not be found among you anyone who makes his son or daughter pass through the fire [as a sacrifice], one who uses divination and fortune-telling, one who practices witchcraft, or one who interprets omens, or a sorcerer, 11or one who casts a charm or spell, or a medium, or a spiritist, or a necromancer [who seeks the dead]. 12For everyone who does these things is utterly repulsive to the LORD; and because of these detestable practices the LORD your God is driving them out before you. 13You shall be blameless (complete, perfect) before the LORD your God. 14For these nations which you shall dispossess listen to those who practice witchcraft and to diviners and fortune-tellers, but as for you, the LORD your God has not allowed you to do so.\n\n15“The LORD your God will raise up for you a prophet like me [Moses] from among you, from your countrymen (brothers, brethren). You shall listen to him. 16This is according to all that you asked of the LORD your God at Horeb (Mount Sinai) on the day of the assembly, saying, ‘Let me not hear the voice of the LORD my God again, nor see this great fire anymore, so that I will not die.’ 17The LORD said to me, ‘They have spoken well. 18‘I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like you, and I will put My words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command him. 19‘It shall come about that whoever will not listen to My words which he shall speak in My name, I Myself will require it of him [and there will be consequences]. 20‘But the prophet who presumes to speak a word in My name which I have not commanded him to speak, or which he speaks in the name of other gods—that prophet shall die.’ 21If you say in your heart, ‘How will we know and recognize the word which the LORD has not spoken?’ 22When a prophet speaks in the name of the LORD and the thing does not happen or come true, that is the thing which the LORD has not spoken. The prophet has spoken it presumptuously; you shall not be afraid of him.\n\nDeuteronomy 19\nCities Of Refuge\n\n1“When the LORD your God cuts off (destroys) the nations whose land He is giving you, and you dispossess them and live in their cities and in their houses, 2you shall designate three cities for yourself in the central area of the land, which the LORD your God is giving you to possess. 3You shall prepare and maintain for yourself the roads [to these cities], and divide the territory of your land into three parts, so that anyone who kills another unintentionally may escape there [for asylum].\n\n4“Now this is the case of the offender (manslayer) who may escape there and live [protected from vengeance]: when he kills his neighbor unintentionally, not having hated him previously— 5as [for example] when a man goes into the forest with his neighbor to cut wood, and his hand swings the axe to cut down the tree, but the iron head slips off the wooden handle and hits his companion and he dies—the offender may escape to one of these cities and live; 6otherwise the avenger of blood might pursue the offender in the heat of anger, and overtake him, because it is a long way, and take his life, even though he did not deserve to die, since he did not hate his neighbor beforehand. 7Therefore, I command you, saying, ‘You shall set aside three cities [of refuge] for yourself.’\n\n8“If the LORD your God enlarges your border, as He has sworn to your fathers to do, and gives you all the land which He promised to give to your fathers— 9if you keep and carefully observe all these commandments which I am commanding you today, to love the LORD your God, and to walk [that is, to live each and every day] always in His ways—then you shall add three more cities [of refuge] for yourself, besides these three, 10so that innocent blood will not be shed [by blood avengers] in your land which the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, and blood guilt will not be on you [for the death of an innocent man].\n\n11“But if there is a man who hates his neighbor and lies in wait and ambush for him and attacks him and strikes him down so that he dies, and the assailant escapes to one of these cities, 12then the elders of his own city shall send for him and have him taken back from there and turn him over to the avenger of blood, so that he may be put to death. 13You shall not pity him [the guilty one], but you shall purge the blood of the innocent from Israel, so that it may go well with you.\n\nLaws of Landmark and Testimony 14“You shall not move your neighbor’s boundary mark, which the forefathers [who first divided the territory] have set, in the land which you will inherit in the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess.\n\n15“A single witness shall not appear in a trial against a man for any wrong or any sin which he has committed; [only] on the testimony or evidence of two or three witnesses shall a charge be confirmed. 16If a malicious witness rises up against a man to [falsely] accuse him of wrongdoing, 17then both parties to the controversy shall stand before the LORD, before the priests and the judges who will be in office at that time. 18The judges shall investigate thoroughly, and if the witness is a false witness, and he has accused his brother falsely, 19then you shall do to him just as he had intended to do to his brother. So you shall remove the evil from among you. 20Those who remain will hear and be afraid, and will never again do such an evil thing among you. 21You shall not show pity [to the guilty one]: it shall be life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot.\n\nDeuteronomy 20\nLaws Of Warfare\n\n1“When you go out to battle against your enemies and see horses and chariots and people more numerous than you, do not be afraid of them; for the LORD your God, who brought you up from the land of Egypt, is with you. 2When you approach the battle, the priest shall come forward and speak to the people, 3and shall say to them, ‘Hear, O Israel: you are advancing today to battle against your enemies. Do not lack courage. Do not be afraid, or panic, or tremble [in terror] before them, 4for the LORD your God is He who goes with you, to fight for you against your enemies, to save you.’ 5The officers shall also speak to the soldiers, saying, ‘What man is there who has built a new house and has not yet dedicated it? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would dedicate it. 6‘What man has planted a vineyard and has not put it to use [harvesting its fruit]? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would begin to use its fruit. 7‘And who is the man who is engaged (legally promised) to a woman and has not married her? Let him go and return to his house, otherwise he might die in the battle and another man would marry her.’ 8Then the officers shall speak further to the soldiers and say, ‘Who is the man who is afraid and lacks courage? Let him go and return to his house, so that he does not cause his brothers’ courage to fail like his own.’ 9And it shall be when the officers have finished speaking to the soldiers, they shall appoint commanders of armies over them.\n\n10“When you advance to a city to fight against it, you shall [first] offer it terms of peace. 11If that city accepts your terms of peace and opens its gates to you, then all the people who are found in it shall become your forced labor and shall serve you. 12However, if it does not make peace with you, but makes war against you, then you shall lay siege to it. 13When the LORD your God gives it into your hand, you shall strike down all the men in it with the edge of the sword. 14Only the women and the children and the animals and everything that is in the city, all its spoil, you shall take as plunder for yourself; and you shall use the spoil of your enemies which the LORD your God has given you. 15That is what you shall do to all the cities that are very far away from you, which are not among the cities of these nations nearby [which you are to dispossess]. 16Only in the cities of these peoples that the LORD your God is giving you as an inheritance, you shall not leave alive anything that breathes. 17But you shall utterly destroy them, the Hittite, the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, just as the LORD your God has commanded you, 18so that they will not teach you to act in accordance with all the detestable practices which they have done [in worship and service] for their gods, and in this way cause you to sin against the LORD your God.\n\n19“When you besiege a city for a long time, making war against it in order to capture it, you shall not destroy its [fruit-bearing] trees by swinging an axe against them; for you may eat from them, and you shall not cut them down. For is the tree of the field a man, that it should be besieged (destroyed) by you? 20Only the trees which you know are not fruit trees shall you destroy and cut down, so that you may build siegeworks against the city that is making war with you until it falls.\n\nDeuteronomy 21\nExpiation Of A Crime\n\n1“If someone is found slain, lying in the field, in the land which the LORD your God gives you to possess, and it is not known who has killed him, 2then your elders and judges shall go out and measure the distance to the cities which are around the dead person. 3It shall be that the elders of the city which is nearest to the dead man shall take a heifer of the herd, one which has not been worked and which has not pulled in a yoke; 4and the elders of that city shall bring the heifer down to a [river] valley with running water, which has not been plowed or planted, and shall break the heifer’s neck there in the valley. 5Then the priests, the sons of Levi, shall approach, for the LORD your God has chosen them to serve Him and to bless in the Name (Presence) of the LORD; and every dispute and every assault (violent crime) shall be settled by them. 6All the elders of that city nearest to the dead man shall wash their hands over the heifer whose neck was broken in the valley; 7and they shall respond, and say, ‘Our hands did not shed this blood, nor did our eyes see it. 8‘Forgive Your people Israel whom You have redeemed, O LORD, and do not put the guilt of innocent blood among Your people Israel.’ And the guilt of blood shall be forgiven them. 9So shall you remove the guilt of innocent blood from among you, when you do what is right in the sight of the LORD.\n\nDomestic Relations 10“When you go out to battle against your enemies, and the LORD your God hands them over to you and you lead them away captive, 11and you see a beautiful woman among the captives, and desire her and would take her as your wife, 12then you shall bring her [home] to your house, and she shall shave her head and trim her nails [in preparation for mourning]. 13She shall take off the clothes of her captivity and remain in your house, and weep (mourn) for her father and her mother a full month. After that you may go in to her and be her husband and she shall be your wife. 14But it shall be that if you have no delight and take no pleasure in her, then you shall let her go wherever she wishes. You certainly shall not sell her for money; you shall not deal with her as a slave or mistreat her, because you have humbled her [by forced marriage].\n\n15“If a man has two wives, one loved and the other unloved, and both the loved and the unloved have born him sons, and the firstborn son belongs to the unloved wife, 16then on the day when he wills his possessions to his sons, he cannot treat the son of his loved wife as firstborn in place of the son of the unloved wife—the [actual] firstborn. 17Instead he shall acknowledge the son of the unloved as the firstborn, by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he was the beginning of his strength (generative power); to him belongs the right of the firstborn.\n\n18“If any man has a stubborn and rebellious son who will not obey the voice of his father or of his mother, and when they reprimand and discipline him, he will not listen to them, 19then his father and mother shall take hold of him, and bring him out to the elders of his city at the gateway of his hometown. 20They shall say to the elders of his city, ‘This son of ours is stubborn and rebellious; he will not obey us, he is a glutton and a drunkard.’ 21Then all the men of his city shall stone him to death; so you shall remove the evil from among you, and all Israel will hear of it and be afraid.\n\n22“And if a man has committed a sin worthy of death, and he is put to death and [afterward] you hang him on a tree [as a public example], 23his body shall not hang all night on the tree, but you shall most certainly bury him on the same day (for he who is hanged is cursed by God), so that you do not defile your land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance.\n\nDeuteronomy 22\nVarious Laws\n\n1“You shall not see your countryman’s ox or his sheep straying away or being stolen, and ignore [your duty to help] them; you shall certainly take them back to him. 2If your countryman is not nearby or you do not know him, you shall bring the animal to your house, and it shall stay with you until he searches for it; then you shall return it to him. 3You shall do this with his donkey or with his garment or with anything that your countryman has lost and you have found. You are not allowed to ignore [your duty to help] them. 4You shall not see your countryman’s donkey or his ox fall down along the road, and ignore [your duty to help] them; you shall certainly help him lift it up.\n\n5“A woman shall not wear a man’s clothing, nor shall a man put on a woman’s clothing; for whoever does these things is utterly repulsive to the LORD your God.\n\n6“If you happen to come upon a bird’s nest along the road, in any tree or on the ground, with young ones or eggs, and the mother [bird] is sitting on the young or on the eggs, you shall not take the mother with the young. 7You shall certainly let the mother go, but you may take the young for yourself, so that it may be well with you and that you may prolong your days.\n\n8“When you build a new house, you shall make a railing (parapet) around your [flat] roof, so that you do not bring the guilt of [innocent] blood on your house if someone falls from it.\n\n9“You shall not sow your vineyard with two kinds of seed, or everything produced by the seed which you have sown and the yield of the vineyard will become defiled [and banned for use].\n\n10“You shall not plow with an ox [a clean animal] and a donkey [an unclean animal] together.\n\n11“You shall not wear a fabric made of wool and linen blended together [a fabric pagans believed to be magical].\n\n12“You shall make tassels for yourself on the four corners of your outer garment with which you cover yourself.\n\nLaws on Morality 13“If any man takes a wife and goes in to her and then scorns and hates her, 14and charges her [without cause] with shameful behavior and publicly defames her, and says, ‘I took this woman, but when I approached her, I did not find in her evidence of virginity,’ 15then the young woman’s father and her mother shall get and bring out the evidence of her virginity to the elders of the city at the gate [where court is held]. 16The father of the young woman shall say to the elders, ‘I gave my daughter to this man as a wife, but he hates her and has turned against her; 17and behold, he has made baseless charges against her, saying, “I did not find in your daughter the evidence of her virginity.” But this is the evidence of my daughter’s virginity.’ And they shall spread out the garment before the elders of the city. 18Then the elders of that city shall take the man and reprimand him, 19and they shall fine him a hundred shekels of silver and give it to the father of the young woman, because he publicly defamed a virgin of Israel. And she shall remain his wife; he is not allowed to divorce her as long as he lives.\n\n20“But if this charge is true that the evidence of virginity was not found in the young woman, 21then they shall bring her out to the doorway of her father’s house, and the men of her city shall stone her to death because she has committed a deliberate sin in Israel by playing the prostitute in her father’s house. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n\n22“If a man is intimate with a woman who is another man’s wife, they shall both be put to death, the man who lay with the woman, and the woman. So you shall remove the evil from Israel.\n\n23“If a young woman who is a virgin is engaged (legally betrothed) to a man, and another man finds her in the city and is intimate with her, 24then you shall bring them both out to the gate of that city and stone them to death—the young woman because she did not cry out for help [though she was] in the city, and the man because he has violated his neighbor’s [promised] wife. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n\n25“However, if the man finds the girl who is engaged (legally betrothed) in the [open] field, and seizes her and is intimate with her [by force], then only the man who lies with her shall be put to death. 26But you shall do nothing to the young woman; she has committed no sin worthy of death, for this is the same as when a man attacks his neighbor and murders him. 27When he found her in the [open] field, the engaged girl [may have] cried out for help, but there was no one to [hear and] save her.\n\n28“If a man finds a girl who is a virgin, who is not engaged, and seizes her and is intimate with her and they are discovered, 29then the man who was intimate with her shall give fifty shekels of silver to the girl’s father, and she shall become his wife because he has violated her; he can never divorce her.\n\n30“A man shall not take his father’s [former] wife, so that he will not expose his father’s wife.\n\nDeuteronomy 23\nPersons Excluded From The Assembly\n\n1“He who has been castrated by having his testicles crushed or his male organ cut off shall not enter the congregation of the LORD. 2A person of illegitimate birth shall not enter the assembly of the LORD; none of his descendants, even to the tenth generation. 3An Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter the assembly of the LORD; none of their descendants, even to the tenth generation, shall ever enter the assembly of the LORD, 4because they did not meet you with bread (food) and water on the road as you came out of Egypt, and because they hired [to act] against you Balaam the son of Beor from Pethor of Mesopotamia, to curse you. 5Nevertheless, the LORD your God was not willing to listen to Balaam, but the LORD your God turned the curse into a blessing for you because the LORD your God has loved you. 6You shall never seek their peace nor their prosperity all your days.\n\n7“You shall not detest an Edomite, for he is your brother [Esau’s descendant]. You shall not detest an Egyptian, because you were a stranger (resident alien, foreigner) in his land. 8Their children of the third generation who are born to them may enter the assembly of the LORD.\n\n9“When you go out as an army [to fight] against your enemies, you shall keep yourselves from every evil [thing].\n\n10“If there is any man among you who is [ceremonially] unclean because of nocturnal emission, then he must go outside the camp; he shall not come back to the camp. 11But when evening comes, he shall bathe in water, and at sundown he may return to the camp.\n\n12“You shall also have a place outside the camp to which you may go, 13and you shall have a spade among your tools, and when you [prepare to] sit down outside [to relieve yourself], you shall dig a hole with it and shall turn and cover up your waste. 14Since the LORD your God walks in the midst of your camp to rescue you and to defeat your enemies before you, therefore your camp must be holy (undefiled); and He must not see anything indecent among you or He will turn away from you.\n\n15“You shall not hand over to his master a slave who has escaped from his master to you. 16He shall live among you, in the place he chooses in one of your cities where it pleases him; you shall not mistreat or oppress him.\n\n17“There shall be no cult prostitute among the daughters of Israel, nor shall there be a cult prostitute (a sodomite) among the sons of Israel. 18You shall not bring the wages of a prostitute or the price of a dog [that is, a male prostitute] into the house of the LORD your God as payment for any vow, for both of these [the gift and the giver] are utterly repulsive to the LORD your God.\n\n19“You shall not charge interest to your fellow Israelite—interest on money, food or anything that may be loaned for interest. 20You may charge interest to a foreigner, but to your fellow Israelite you shall not charge interest, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all that you undertake in the land which you are about to enter to possess.\n\n21“When you make a vow to the LORD your God, you shall not delay to pay it, for He will most certainly require it of you, and a delay would cause you to sin. 22But if you refrain from making a vow, that would not be [counted as] sin in you. 23You shall be careful to perform that [vow] which passes your lips, just as you have made a voluntary vow to the LORD your God, just as you have promised with your own words (mouth).\n\n24“When you enter your neighbor’s vineyard, you may eat your fill of grapes, as many as you please, but you shall not put any in your basket [to take with you].\n\n25“When you come into the standing grain of your neighbor, you may pluck the ears of grain with your hand, but you shall not wield a sickle in your neighbor’s standing grain [to harvest it].\n\nDeuteronomy 24\nLaw Of Divorce\n\n1“When a man takes a wife and marries her, and it happens that she loses his favor because he has found something indecent or unacceptable about her, and he writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand and sends her out of his house, 2and after she leaves his house, she goes and becomes another man’s wife, 3and if the latter husband turns against her and writes her a certificate of divorce, puts it in her hand, and sends her out of his house, or if the latter husband dies who took her as his wife, 4then her former husband who [first] sent her away may not take her again as his wife, since she has been defiled; for that is an outrage before the LORD, and you shall not bring sin on the land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance.\n\n5“When a man takes a new wife, he shall not go out [to fight] with the army nor be charged with any duty; he shall be free at home for one year and shall bring happiness to his wife whom he has taken.\n\nVarious Laws 6“No one shall take a handmill or an upper millstone [used to grind grain into bread] as security [for a debt], for he would be taking a [person’s] life in pledge.\n\n7“If a man is caught kidnapping any of his countrymen from the sons of Israel, and he treats him violently or sells him [as a slave], then that thief shall die. So you shall remove the evil from among you.\n\n8“Be careful during an outbreak of leprosy, that you diligently observe and do according to all that the Levitical priests teach you; just as I have commanded them, so you shall be careful to do. 9Remember [with thoughtful concern] what the LORD your God did to Miriam on the road as you came out of Egypt.\n\n10“When you lend your neighbor anything, you shall not go into his house to get his pledge (security deposit). 11You shall stand outside, and the man to whom you lend shall bring the pledge out to you. 12If the man is poor, you shall not keep his pledge overnight. 13You shall certainly restore the pledge (security deposit) to him at sunset, so that he may sleep in his garment and bless you; and it will be credited to you as righteousness (right standing) before the LORD your God.\n\n14“You shall not take advantage of a hired servant who is poor and needy, whether [he is] one of your countrymen or one of the strangers (resident aliens, foreigners) who is in your land inside your cities. 15You shall give him his wages on the day that he earns them before the sun sets—for he is poor and is counting on it—so that he does not cry out to the LORD against you, and it becomes a sin for you.\n\n16“The fathers shall not be put to death for [the sins of] their children, nor shall the children be put to death for their fathers; [only] for his own sin shall anyone be put to death.\n\n17“You shall not pervert the justice due a stranger or an orphan, nor seize (impound) a widow’s garment as security [for a loan]. 18But you shall remember that you were a slave in Egypt, and the LORD your God redeemed you from there; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.\n\n19“When you reap your harvest in your field and have forgotten a sheaf [of grain] in the field, you shall not go back to get it; it shall be for the stranger, for the orphan, and for the widow, so that the LORD your God may bless you in all the work of your hands. 20When you beat [the olives off of] your olive tree, do not search through the branches again; [whatever is left] shall be for the stranger, for the orphan, and for the widow.\n\n21“When you gather the grapes of your vineyard, you shall not glean it afterward; it shall be for the stranger, for the orphan, and for the widow. 22You shall [thoughtfully] remember [the fact] that you were a slave in the land of Egypt; therefore I am commanding you to do this thing.\n\nDeuteronomy 25\nVarious Laws\n\n1“If there is a controversy between men, and they go to court, and the judges decide [the issue] between them, and they judge in favor of the innocent and condemn the guilty, 2then it shall be that if the guilty man deserves to be beaten, the judge shall make him lie down and be beaten in his presence with a [certain] number of stripes in proportion to his offense. 3He may have him beaten forty times, but no more. He is not to be beaten with more stripes than these and he is not to be degraded [that is, treated like an animal] in your sight.\n\n4“You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing [to prevent him from eating any of the grain].\n\n5“If brothers are living together and one of them dies without a son, the widow of the deceased shall not be married outside the family to a stranger. Her husband’s brother shall be intimate with her after taking her as his wife and perform the duty of a husband’s brother to her. 6It shall be that her firstborn [son] will be given the name of the dead brother, so that his name will not be blotted out of Israel. 7But if the man does not want to marry his brother’s [widowed] wife, then she shall go up to the gate [of the city, where court is held] to the elders, and say, ‘My brother-in-law refuses to continue his brother’s name in Israel; he is not willing to perform the duty of a husband’s brother.’ 8Then the elders of his city will summon him and speak to him. And if he stands firm and says, ‘I do not want to marry her,’ 9then his brother’s widow shall approach him in the presence of the elders, and pull his sandal off his foot and spit in his face; and she shall answer and say, ‘So it is done to that man who does not build up his brother’s household.’ 10In Israel his [family] name shall be, ‘The house of him whose sandal was removed.’\n\n11“If [two] men, a man and his countryman, are fighting and the wife of one approaches to rescue her husband from the man who is striking him, and she reaches out with her hand and grabs the aggressor’s genitals, 12then you shall cut off her hand; you shall not show pity [for her].\n\n13“You shall not have in your bag inaccurate weights, a heavy and a light [so you can cheat others]. 14You shall not have in your house inaccurate measures, a large and a small. 15You shall have a perfect (full) and just weight, and a perfect and just measure, so that your days may be long in the land which the LORD your God gives you. 16For everyone who does such things, everyone who acts unjustly [without personal integrity] is utterly repulsive to the LORD your God.\n\n17“Remember what Amalek did to you along the road when you came from Egypt, 18how he met you along the road and attacked all the stragglers at your rear when you were tired and weary; and he did not fear God. 19Therefore when the LORD your God has given you rest from all your surrounding enemies, in the land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance to possess, you shall wipe out the memory of Amalek from under heaven; you must not forget.\n\nDeuteronomy 26\nOffering First Fruits\n\n1“Then it shall be, when you enter the land which the LORD your God gives you as an inheritance, and you take possession of it and live in it, 2that you shall take some of the first of all the produce of the ground which you harvest from the land that the LORD your God gives you, and you shall put it in a basket and go to the place where the LORD your God chooses to establish His Name (Presence). 3You shall go to the priest who is in office at that time and say to him, ‘I declare this day to the LORD my God that I have entered the land which the LORD swore to our fathers to give us.’ 4Then the priest will take the basket from you and place it before the altar of the LORD your God. 5And you shall say before the LORD your God, ‘My father [Jacob] was a wandering Aramean, and he [along with his family] went down to Egypt and lived there [as strangers], few in number; but while there he became a great, mighty and populous nation. 6‘And the Egyptians treated us badly and oppressed us, and imposed hard labor on us. 7‘Then we cried out to the LORD, the God of our fathers for help, and He heard our voice and saw our suffering and our labor and our [cruel] oppression; 8and the LORD brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand and with an outstretched arm and with great terror [suffered by the Egyptians] and with signs and with wonders; 9and He has brought us to this place and has given us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey. 10‘And now, look, I have brought the first of the produce of the ground which You, O LORD, have given me.’ And you shall place it before the LORD your God, and shall worship before the LORD your God; 11and you and the Levite and the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) among you shall rejoice in all the good which the LORD your God has given you and your household.\n\n12“When you have finished paying all the tithe of your produce the third year, [which is] the year of tithing, then you shall give it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow, so that they may eat within the gates of your cities and be satisfied. 13You shall say before the LORD your God, ‘I have removed the sacred portion (the tithe) from my house and also have given it to the Levite, to the stranger, to the orphan, and to the widow, in accordance with all that You have commanded me. I have not transgressed or forgotten any of Your commandments. 14‘I have not eaten from the tithe while mourning, nor have I removed any of it when I was [ceremonially] unclean [making the tithe ceremonially unclean], nor offered any of it to the dead. I have listened to the voice of the LORD my God; I have done everything in accordance with all that You have commanded me. 15‘Look down from Your holy dwelling above, from heaven, and bless Your people Israel, and the land which You have given us, as You have sworn to our fathers, a land [of plenty] flowing with milk and honey.’\n\n16“This day the LORD your God commands you to do these statutes and judgments (precepts). Therefore, you shall be careful to do them with all your heart and with all your soul (your entire being). 17Today you have [openly] declared the LORD to be your God, and that you will walk [that is, live each and every day] in His ways and keep His statutes, His commandments, and His judgments (precepts), and listen to His voice. 18Today the LORD has declared that you are His people, His treasured possession, just as He promised you, and that you are to keep all His commandments; 19and that He will set you high above all the nations which He has made, for praise, fame, and honor: and that you shall be a holy people [set apart and consecrated] to the LORD your God, just as He has spoken.”\n\nDeuteronomy 27\nThe Altar At Mount Ebal\n\n1Then Moses and the elders of Israel commanded the people, saying, “Keep (remember, obey) all the commandments which I am commanding you today. 2So it shall be on the day when you cross the Jordan to [enter] the land which the LORD your God gives you, that you shall set up for yourself large stones and coat them with plaster (lime, whitewash). 3You shall write on the stones all the words of this law when you cross over, so that you may go into the land which the LORD your God gives you, a land [of plenty] flowing with milk and honey, just as the LORD, the God of your fathers has promised you. 4Now when you cross the Jordan you shall set up these stones on Mount Ebal, just as I am commanding you today and coat them with plaster. 5There you shall build an altar to the LORD your God, an altar of stones; you shall not use an iron tool on them. 6You shall build the altar of the LORD your God with whole [uncut] stones, and offer burnt offerings on it to the LORD your God; 7and you shall sacrifice peace offerings and shall eat there, and shall rejoice before the LORD your God. 8“And you shall write very clearly on the stones all the words of this law.”\n\n9Then Moses and the Levitical priests said to all Israel, “Be silent and listen, O Israel! This day you have become a people for the LORD your God. 10“So you shall obey the voice of the LORD your God, and do His commandments and statutes which I am commanding you today.”\n\nThe Curses of Mount Ebal 11Moses also commanded the people that day, saying, 12“These [tribes] shall stand on Mount Gerizim to bless the people when you have crossed the Jordan: Simeon, Levi, Judah, Issachar, Joseph, and Benjamin. 13These [tribes] shall stand on Mount Ebal to pronounce the curse [for disobedience]: Reuben, Gad, Asher, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphtali. 14The Levites shall answer with a loud voice to all the men of Israel:\n\n15‘Cursed is the man who makes a carved or cast image (idol), a repulsive thing to the LORD, the work of the hands of the artisan, and sets it up in secret.’ All the people shall answer and say, ‘Amen.’\n\n16‘Cursed is he who dishonors (treats with contempt) his father or his mother.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n17‘Cursed is he who moves his neighbor’s boundary mark.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n18‘Cursed is he who misleads a blind person on the road.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n19‘Cursed is he who distorts (perverts) the justice due to a stranger, an orphan, and a widow.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n20‘Cursed is he who is intimate with his father’s [former] wife, because he has violated what belongs to his father.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n21‘Cursed is he who is intimate with any animal.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n22‘Cursed is he who is intimate with his [half] sister, whether his father’s or his mother’s daughter.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n23‘Cursed is he who is intimate with his mother-in-law.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n24‘Cursed is he who strikes his neighbor in secret.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n25‘Cursed is he who accepts a bribe to strike down an innocent person.’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\n26‘Cursed is he who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them [keeping them, taking them to heart as the rule of his life].’ And all the people shall say, ‘Amen.’\n\nDeuteronomy 28\nBlessings At Gerizim\n\n1“Now it shall be, if you diligently listen to and obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all of His commandments which I am commanding you today, the LORD your God will set you high above all the nations of the earth. 2All these blessings will come upon you and overtake you if you pay attention to the voice of the LORD your God.\n\n3“You will be blessed in the city, and you will be blessed in the field.\n\n4“The offspring of your body and the produce of your ground and the offspring of your animals, the offspring of your herd and the young of your flock will be blessed.\n\n5“Your basket and your kneading bowl will be blessed.\n\n6“You will be blessed when you come in and you will be blessed when you go out.\n\n7“The LORD will cause the enemies who rise up against you to be defeated before you; they will come out against you one way, but flee before you seven ways. 8The LORD will command the blessing upon you in your storehouses and in all that you undertake, and He will bless you in the land which the LORD your God gives you. 9The LORD will establish you as a people holy [and set apart] to Himself, just as He has sworn to you, if you keep the commandments of the LORD your God and walk [that is, live your life each and every day] in His ways. 10So all the peoples of the earth will see that you are called by the name of the LORD, and they will be afraid of you. 11The LORD will give you great prosperity, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your livestock and the produce of your ground, in the land which the LORD swore to your fathers to give you. 12The LORD will open for you His good treasure house, the heavens, to give rain to your land in its season and to bless all the work of your hand; and you will lend to many nations, but you will not borrow. 13The LORD will make you the head (leader) and not the tail (follower); and you will be above only, and you will not be beneath, if you listen and pay attention to the commandments of the LORD your God, which I am commanding you today, to observe them carefully. 14Do not turn aside from any of the words which I am commanding you today, to the right or to the left, to follow and serve other gods.\n\nConsequences of Disobedience 15“But it shall come about, if you do not listen to and obey the voice of the LORD your God, being careful to do all His commandments and His statutes which I am commanding you today, then all these curses will come upon you and overtake you:\n\n16“You will be cursed in the city and cursed in the field.\n\n17“Your basket and your kneading bowl will be cursed.\n\n18“The offspring of your body and the produce of your land, the offspring of your herd and the young of your flock will be cursed.\n\n19“You will be cursed when you come in and you will be cursed when you go out.\n\n20“The LORD will send upon you curses, confusion, and rebuke in everything that you undertake to do, until you are destroyed, perishing quickly because of the evil of your deeds, because you have turned away from Me. 21The LORD will make the pestilence and plague cling to you until He has consumed and eliminated you from the land which you are entering to possess. 22The LORD will strike you with consumption [causing you to waste away] and with fever and with inflammation and with fiery heat and with the sword and with blight and with mildew [on your crops]; and they will pursue you until you perish. 23The heaven which is over your head shall be bronze [giving no rain and blocking all prayers], and the earth which is under you, iron [hard to plow and yielding no produce]. 24The LORD will make the rain of your land powder and dust; from heaven it will come down on you until you are destroyed.\n\n25“The LORD will cause you to be defeated before your enemies; you will go out against them one way, but flee before them seven ways, and you will be an example of terror to all the kingdoms of the earth [when they see your destruction]. 26Your carcasses will be food for all the birds of the sky and the beasts of the earth, and there will be no one to frighten them away.\n\n27“The LORD will strike you with the boils of Egypt and with tumors and with the scab and the itch that you cannot heal. 28The LORD will strike you with madness and with blindness and with bewilderment of heart and mind; 29and you will be groping at noon [in broad daylight], just as the blind grope in the darkness, and nothing you do will prosper; but you will only be oppressed and exploited and robbed continually, with no one to save you. 30You will be pledged to marry a wife, but another man will be intimate with her [before you]; you will build a house, but you will not live in it; you will plant a vineyard, but you will not use its fruit. 31Your ox will be slaughtered before your eyes, but you will not eat any of it; your donkey will be torn away from you, and it will not be returned to you; your sheep will be given to your enemies, and you will have no one to save you. 32Your sons and daughters will be given to another people, while your eyes look on and long for them continually; but there will be nothing you can do. 33A people whom you do not know will eat the produce of your land and all the products of your labors, and you will never be anything but oppressed and exploited and crushed continually. 34You shall be driven mad by the sight of the things you see. 35The LORD will strike you on the knees and on the legs with sore boils that you cannot heal, from the sole of your foot to the crown of your head. 36The LORD will bring you and your king, whom you appoint over you, to a nation which you and your fathers have never known; there you will [be forced to] serve other gods, [lifeless gods of] wood and stone. 37And you will become a horror, a proverb [a mere object lesson], and a taunt [a derisive joke] among all the people to which the LORD drives you.\n\n38“You will bring out a great quantity of seed to the field, but you will gather in little, because the locusts will consume it. 39You will plant vineyards and cultivate them, but you will not drink the wine or gather the grapes, because the worm will eat them. 40You will have olive trees throughout your territory but you will not anoint yourselves with the oil, because your olives will drop off. 41You will have sons and daughters, but they will not be yours [for long], because they will go into captivity. 42The cricket will take possession of all your trees and the produce of your ground. 43The stranger who lives among you will rise above you higher and higher, and you will go down lower and lower. 44He will lend to you [out of his affluence], but you will not lend to him [because of your poverty]; he will be the head, and you the tail.\n\n45“So all these curses will come on you and pursue you and overtake you until you are destroyed, because you would not obey the voice of the LORD your God by keeping His commandments and His statutes which He has commanded you. 46They will be a sign and a wonder to you and your descendants forever.\n\n47“Because you did not serve the LORD your God with a heart full of joy and gladness for the abundance of all things [with which He blessed you], 48you will therefore serve your enemies whom the LORD sends against you, in hunger and in thirst, in nakedness and in lack of all things; and He will put an iron yoke [of slavery] on your neck until He has destroyed you.\n\n49“The LORD will bring a nation against you from far away, from the end of the earth, [as swift] as the eagle swoops down [to attack], a nation whose language you will not understand, 50a defiant nation who will have no respect for the old, nor show favor to the young, 51and it will eat the offspring of your herd and the produce of your ground until you are destroyed, who will leave you no grain, new wine, or oil, nor the offspring of your herd or the young of your flock until they have caused you to perish. 52They will besiege you in all your cities until your high and fortified walls in which you trusted come down throughout your land; and they will besiege you in all your cities throughout your land which the LORD your God has given you. 53Then you will eat the offspring of your own body [to avoid starvation], the flesh of your sons and daughters whom the LORD your God has given you, during the siege and the misery by which your enemy will oppress you. 54The man who is most refined and well-bred among you will be cruel and hostile toward his brother and toward the wife he cherishes and toward the rest of his children who remain, 55so that he will not give even one of them any of the flesh of his children which he will eat, because he has nothing else left, during the siege and the misery by which your enemy will oppress you in all your cities. 56The most refined and well-bred woman among you, who would not venture to set the sole of her foot on the ground because she is so delicate and pampered, will be cruel and hostile toward the husband she cherishes and toward her son and daughter, 57and toward her afterbirth that comes from between her legs and toward the children whom she bears; for she will eat them secretly for lack of anything else, during the siege and the misery by which your enemy will oppress you in your cities.\n\n58“If you are not careful to do all the words of this law that are written in this book, to fear and honor with reverence this glorious and awesome name, the LORD your God, 59then the LORD will bring extraordinary plagues on you and your descendants, even severe and lasting plagues, and miserable and chronic sicknesses. 60Moreover, He will bring on you all the diseases of Egypt of which you were afraid, and they will cling to you. 61Also the LORD will bring on you every sickness and every plague which is not written in this book of this law, until you are destroyed. 62Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD your God, you who were as numerous as the stars of heaven shall be left few in number. 63It shall come about that just as the LORD delighted over you to make you prosper and multiply, so the LORD will delight over you to bring you to ruin and destruction; and you will be uprooted [violently] from the land which you are entering to possess. 64And the LORD will scatter you among all the nations, from one end of the earth to the other; and there you will [be forced to] serve other gods, [lifeless gods of] wood and stone, which neither you nor your fathers have known. 65Among those nations you will find no peace (rest), and there will be no resting place for the sole of your foot; but there the LORD will give you a trembling heart, failing eyes, and a despairing soul. 66Your life will hang in doubt before you; night and day you will be filled with anxiety and have no assurance of living. 67In the morning you will say, ‘I wish it were evening!’ and in the evening you will say, ‘I wish it were morning!’—because of the dread in your heart with which you tremble, and because of the sight of your eyes which you will see. 68The LORD will bring you back to Egypt in ships, by the way about which I said to you, ‘You will never see it again!’ And there you will offer yourselves for sale to your enemies as male and female slaves, but there will be no one to buy you.\n\nDeuteronomy 29\nThe Covenant In Moab\n\n1These are the words of the covenant which the LORD commanded Moses to make with the sons of Israel in the land of Moab, in addition to the covenant which He made with them at Horeb (Sinai).\n\n2Moses summoned all Israel and said to them, “You have seen all that the LORD did before your eyes in the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, to all his servants, and to all his land; 3the great trials [of Pharaoh] which your eyes have seen, the signs and those great wonders. 4Yet to this day the LORD has not given you a heart and mind to understand, nor eyes to see, nor ears to hear. 5I have led you in the wilderness forty years; your clothes have not worn out on you, and your sandals have not worn out on your feet. 6You have not eaten bread, nor have you drunk wine or strong drink, so that you might know that I am the LORD your God [on whom you must depend]. 7When you reached this place, Sihon the king of Heshbon and Og the king of Bashan came out to meet us in battle, but we defeated them; 8and we took their land and gave it as an inheritance to the tribe of Reuben, the tribe of Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh. 9So keep the words of this covenant and obey them, so that you may prosper and be successful in everything that you do.\n\n10“All of you stand today before the LORD your God—your chiefs, your tribes, your elders and your officers, even all the men of Israel, 11your little ones, your wives, and the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) who is in your camps, from the one who chops and gathers your firewood to the one who draws your water— 12so that you may enter into the covenant of the LORD your God, and into His oath and agreement which the LORD your God is making with you today, 13so that He may establish you today as His people and that He may be your God, just as He spoke to you and as He swore to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.\n\n14“It is not with you alone that I am making this covenant and this oath, 15but with those [future Israelites] who are not here with us today, as well as with those who stand here with us today in the presence of the LORD our God 16(for you know how we lived in the land of Egypt, and how we passed through the nations along the way; 17and you have seen their detestable acts and their [repulsive] idols of wood and stone, [lifeless images] of silver and gold, which they had with them), 18so that there will not be among you a man or woman, or family or tribe, whose heart turns away today from the LORD our God, to go and serve the [false] gods of these nations; so that there will not be among you a root [of idolatry] bearing poisonous fruit and wormwood (bitterness). 19It will happen that when he (a renegade) hears the words of this oath, and he imagines himself as blessed, saying, ‘I will have peace and safety even though I walk within the stubbornness of my heart [rejecting God and His law], in order that the watered land dwindles away along with the dry [destroying everything],’ 20the LORD will not be willing to forgive him, but then the anger of the LORD and His jealousy will burn against that man, and every curse which is written in this book will rest on him; the LORD will blot out his name from under heaven. 21Then the LORD will single him out for disaster from all the tribes of Israel [making an example of him], according to all the curses of the covenant that are written in this Book of the Law.\n\n22Now the next generation, your children who come after you and the foreigner who comes from a distant land, when they see the plagues of this land and the diseases with which the LORD has afflicted it, will say, 23‘The whole land is brimstone and salt, a burning waste, unsown and unproductive, and no grass grows in it; it is like the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah, Admah and Zeboiim, which the LORD overthrew in His anger and wrath.’ 24All the nations will say, ‘Why has the LORD done this thing to this land? Why this great outburst of anger?’ 25Then people will say, ‘It is because they abandoned (broke) the covenant of the LORD, the God of their fathers, which He made with them when He brought them out of the land of Egypt. 26‘For they went and served other gods and worshiped them, [false] gods whom they have not known and whom He had not allotted (given) to them. 27‘So the anger of the LORD burned against this land, bringing on it every curse that is written in this book; 28and the LORD uprooted them from their land in anger and in wrath and in great indignation, and cast them into another land, as it is this day.’\n\n29“The secret things belong to the LORD our God, but the things which are revealed and disclosed belong to us and to our children forever, so that we may do all of the words of this law.\n\nDeuteronomy 30\nRestoration Promised\n\n1“So it shall be when all these things have come on you, the blessing and the curse which I have set before you, and you call them to mind in all the nations where the LORD your God has driven you, 2and you have returned to the LORD your God and have listened to and obeyed His voice with all your heart and with all your soul, in accordance with everything that I am commanding you today, you and your children, 3then the LORD your God will restore your fortunes [in your return from exile], and have compassion on you, and will gather you together again from all the peoples (nations) where He has scattered you. 4Even if any of your dispersed are at the ends of the earth, the LORD your God will gather you together from there, and from there He will bring you back. 5The LORD your God will bring you into the land which your fathers possessed, and you will take possession of it; and He shall make you prosper and multiply—even more than your fathers.\n\n6“And the LORD your God will circumcise your heart and the hearts of your descendants [that is, He will remove the desire to sin from your heart], so that you will love the LORD your God with all your heart and all your soul, so that you may live [as a recipient of His blessing]. 7The LORD your God will inflict all these curses on your enemies and on those who hate you, who have persecuted you. 8And you shall again listen to and obey the voice of the LORD, and do all His commandments which I command you today. 9Then the LORD your God shall make you abundantly prosperous in everything that you do, in the offspring of your body and in the offspring of your cattle and in the produce of your land; for the LORD will again delight over you for good, just as He delighted over your fathers, 10if you listen to and obey the voice of the LORD your God to keep His commandments and His statutes which are written in this Book of the Law, and if you turn to the LORD your God with all your heart and with all your soul (your entire being).\n\n11“For this commandment which I am commanding you today is not too difficult for you, nor is it out of reach. 12It is not [a secret hidden] in heaven, that you should say, ‘Who will go up to heaven for us and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and obey it?’ 13Nor is it beyond the sea, that you should say, ‘Who will cross the sea for us and bring it to us, so that we may hear it and obey it?’ 14But the word is very near you, in your mouth and in your heart, so that you may obey it.\n\nChoose Life 15“Listen closely, I have set before you today life and prosperity (good), and death and adversity (evil); 16in that I command you today to love the LORD your God, to walk [that is, to live each and every day] in His ways and to keep His commandments and His statutes and His judgments (precepts), so that you will live and multiply, and that the LORD your God will bless you in the land which you are entering to possess. 17But if your heart turns away and you will not hear and obey, but are drawn away and worship other gods and serve them, 18I declare to you today that you will certainly perish. You will not live long in the land which you cross the Jordan to enter and possess. 19I call heaven and earth as witnesses against you today, that I have set before you life and death, the blessing and the curse; therefore, you shall choose life in order that you may live, you and your descendants, 20by loving the LORD your God, by obeying His voice, and by holding closely to Him; for He is your life [your good life, your abundant life, your fulfillment] and the length of your days, that you may live in the land which the LORD promised (swore) to give to your fathers, to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.”\n\nDeuteronomy 31\nMoses’ Last Counsel\n\n1So Moses went and spoke these words to all Israel. 2And he said to them, “I am a hundred and twenty years old today; I am no longer able to come in and go out [as your spiritual and military leader], and the LORD has said to me, ‘You shall not cross this Jordan.’ 3It is the LORD your God who will cross ahead of you; He will destroy these nations before you, and you shall dispossess them. Joshua is the one who will go across before you [to lead you], just as the LORD has said. 4The LORD will do to them just as He did to Sihon and Og, the kings of the Amorites, and to their land, when He destroyed them. 5The LORD will hand them over to you, and you shall do to them in accordance with all the commandments which I have commanded you. 6“Be strong and courageous, do not be afraid or tremble in dread before them, for it is the LORD your God who goes with you. He will not fail you or abandon you.”\n\n7Then Moses called to Joshua and said to him in the sight of all [the people of] Israel, “Be strong and courageous, for you will go with this people into the land which the LORD has sworn to their fathers to give them, and you will give it to them as an inheritance. 8“It is the LORD who goes before you; He will be with you. He will not fail you or abandon you. Do not fear or be dismayed.”\n\n9So Moses wrote this law and gave it to the priests, the sons of Levi who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, and to all the elders of Israel. 10Then Moses commanded them, saying, “At the end of every seven years, at the time of year when debts are forgiven, at the Feast of Booths (Tabernacles), 11when all Israel comes to appear before the LORD your God in the place which He chooses, you shall read this law before all [the people of] Israel so that they may hear. 12Assemble the people, the men and the women and children and the stranger (resident alien, foreigner) within your cities, so that they may hear and learn and fear the LORD your God [with awe-filled reverence and profound respect], and be careful to obey all the words of this law. 13“Their children, who have not known [the law], will hear and learn to fear [and worship] the LORD your God, as long as you live in the land which you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”\n\nIsrael Will Fall Away 14Then the LORD said to Moses, “Behold, the time for you to die is near; call Joshua, and present yourselves at the Tent of Meeting, so that I may commission him.” So Moses and Joshua went and presented themselves at the Tent of Meeting. 15Then the LORD appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud, and the pillar of cloud stood beside the doorway of the tent. 16The LORD said to Moses, “Behold, you are about to lie down [in death] with your fathers; and this people will arise and play the prostitute (commit apostasy) with the foreign gods [of the people] of the land, where they go to be among them. They will abandon (turn away from) Me and break My covenant which I have made with them. 17Then My anger will be kindled and burn against them in that day, and I will abandon (turn away from) them and hide My face from them. They will be devoured, and many evils and troubles will come on them, so that they will say in that day, ‘Is it not because our God is not among us that these evils have come on us?’ 18But I will certainly hide My face [from them] in that day because of all the evil which they will do, for they will turn to other gods [to worship lifeless idols, to honor handmade relics].\n\n19“Now then, write this song for yourselves, and teach it to the sons of Israel; put it in their mouth, so that this song may be a witness for Me against the sons of Israel. 20For when I bring them into the land which I have sworn to their fathers, a land [of plenty] flowing with milk and honey, and they have eaten and are satisfied and become prosperous, then they will turn to other gods and serve them, and despise and reject Me and break My covenant. 21“Then it shall come about, when many evils and troubles have come on them, that this [sacred] song will confront them as a witness; for it will not be forgotten from the mouth of their descendants. For I know their inclination which is developing even now, before I bring them into the land which I have sworn to give them.” 22So Moses wrote this song the same day, and taught it to the children of Israel.\n\nJoshua Is Commissioned 23Then He commanded and commissioned Joshua, the son of Nun, and said, “Be strong and courageous, for you will bring the sons of Israel into the land which I have sworn to give them, and I will be with you.”\n\n24And when Moses completely finished writing the words of this law in a book, 25he commanded the Levites who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD, saying, 26“Take this Book of the Law and put it beside the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God, so that it may remain there as a witness against you. 27For I know your rebellion and contention and your stubbornness; behold, while I am still alive with you today, you have been rebellious against the LORD; how much more, then, after my death? 28Assemble before me all the elders of your tribes and your officers, so that I may speak these words in their hearing and call heaven and earth as witnesses against them. 29“For I know that after my death you will behave corruptly and turn from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will come upon you in the latter days, because you will do evil in the sight of the LORD, provoking Him to anger with the work of your hands.”\n\n30Then Moses spoke in the hearing of all the congregation of Israel the words of this song, until they were ended:\n\nDeuteronomy 32\nThe Song Of Moses\n\n1“Listen, O heavens, and I will speak;\nAnd let the earth hear the words of my mouth.\n2“Let my teaching drop as the rain,\nMy speech distill as the dew,\nAs the light rain upon the tender grass,\nAnd as the spring showers upon the herb.\n3“For I proclaim the name [and presence] of the LORD;\nAscribe greatness and honor to our God!\n4“The Rock! His work is perfect,\nFor all His ways are just;\nA God of faithfulness without iniquity (injustice),\nJust and upright is He.\n5“They (Israel) have acted corruptly toward Him.\nThey are not His children, because of their [moral] defect;\nBut are a perverse and crooked generation.\n6“Do you thus repay the LORD,\nO foolish and unwise people?\nIs not He your Father who has acquired you [as His own]?\nHe has made you and established you [as a nation].\n7“Remember the days of old,\nConsider the years of many generations.\nAsk your father, and he will inform you,\nYour elders, and they will tell you.\n8“When the Most High gave the nations their inheritance,\nWhen He separated the sons of man,\nHe set the boundaries of the peoples\nAccording to the number of the sons of Israel.\n9“For the LORD’S portion and chosen share is His people;\nJacob (Israel) is the allotment of His inheritance.\n10“He found him in a desert land,\nIn the howling wasteland of a wilderness;\nHe kept circling him, He took care of him,\nHe protected him as the apple of His eye.\n11“As an eagle that protects its nest,\nThat flutters over its young,\nHe spread out His wings and took them,\nHe carried them on His pinions.\n12“So the LORD alone led him;\nThere was no foreign god with him.\n13“He made him (Israel) ride on the high places of the earth,\nAnd he ate the produce of the field;\nAnd He made him suck honey from the rock,\nAnd [olive] oil from the flinty rock,\n14Butter and curds of cows, and milk of the flock,\nWith fat of lambs,\nAnd rams, the breed of Bashan, and goats,\nWith the finest of the wheat;\nAnd you drank wine, the blood of grapes.\n15“But Jeshurun (Israel) became fat and kicked [at God].\nYou became fat, thick, sleek, and obstinate!\nThen he abandoned God who had made him,\nAnd scorned the Rock of his salvation.\n16“They provoked Him to jealousy with strange gods [by denying Him the honor and loyalty that is rightfully and uniquely His];\nAnd with repulsive acts they provoked Him to anger.\n17“They sacrificed to demons, not to God,\nTo gods whom they have not known,\nNew gods who came lately,\nWhom your fathers never feared.\n18“You were unmindful of the Rock who bore you,\nAnd you forgot the God who gave you birth.\n19“The LORD saw it, and rejected them,\nOut of indignation with His sons and His daughters.\n20“Then He said, ‘I will hide My face from them,\nI will see what their end shall be;\nFor they are a perverse generation,\nSons in whom there is no faithfulness.\n21‘They have made Me jealous with what is not God;\nThey have provoked Me to anger with their idols.\nSo I will make them jealous with those who are not a people;\nI will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation.\n22‘For a fire is kindled by My anger,\nAnd it burns to the depths of Sheol (the place of the dead, the nether world),\nIt devours the earth with its yield,\nAnd sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.\n23‘I will heap misfortunes on them;\nI will use My arrows on them.\n24‘They will be wasted by hunger, and consumed by plague\nAnd a bitter destruction;\nAnd I will send the teeth of beasts against them,\nWith the venom of crawling things of the dust.\n25‘Outside the sword will bereave,\nAnd inside [the chambers] terror—\nFor both young man and virgin,\nFor the nursing child and the man of gray hair.\n26‘I would have said, “I will cut them to pieces [scattering them far away],\nI will remove the memory of them from men,”\n27Had I not feared the provocation of the enemy,\nThat their adversaries would misjudge,\nThat they would say, “Our [own] hand has prevailed,\nAnd the LORD has not done all this.”’\n28“For they are a nation devoid of counsel,\nAnd there is no understanding in them.\n29“O that they were wise, that they understood this,\nThat they could discern their future and ultimate fate!\n30“How could one chase a thousand,\nAnd two put ten thousand to flight,\nUnless their Rock had sold them,\nAnd the LORD had given them up?\n31“For their rock is not like our Rock,\nEven our enemies themselves judge this.\n32“For their vine is from the vine of Sodom,\nAnd from the fields of Gomorrah;\nTheir grapes are grapes of poison,\nTheir clusters, bitter.\n33“Their wine is the venom of serpents,\nAnd the deadly poison of vipers.\n34‘Is it not laid up in store with Me,\nSealed up in My treasuries?\n35‘Vengeance is Mine, and retribution,\nIn due time their foot will slip;\nFor the day of their disaster is at hand,\nAnd their doom hurries to meet them.’\n36“For the LORD will vindicate His people,\nAnd will have compassion on His servants,\nWhen He sees that their strength (hand) is gone,\nAnd none remains, whether bond or free.\n37“And He will say, ‘Where are their gods,\nThe rock in which they took refuge?\n38‘Who ate the fat of their sacrifices,\nAnd drank the wine of their drink offering?\nLet them rise up and help you,\nLet them be your hiding place!\n39‘See now that I, I am He,\nAnd there is no god besides Me;\nIt is I who put to death and I who give life.\nI have wounded and it is I who heal,\nAnd there is no one who can deliver from [the power of] My hand.\n40‘Indeed, I lift up My hand to heaven,\nAnd say (swear an oath), as I live forever,\n41If I sharpen the lightning of My sword,\nAnd My hand takes hold of judgment,\nI will render vengeance on My adversaries,\nAnd I will repay those who hate Me.\n42‘I will make My arrows drunk with blood,\nAnd My sword will devour flesh,\nWith the blood of the slain and the captives,\nFrom the heads of the leaders of the enemy.’\n43“Rejoice, O nations, with His people;\nFor He will avenge the blood of His servants,\nAnd will render vengeance on His adversaries,\nAnd will atone for His land and His people.”\n\n44Then Moses came and spoke all the words of this song in the hearing of the people, he and Joshua the son of Nun. 45When Moses had finished speaking all these words to all [the people of] Israel, 46he said to them, “Take to heart all the words of warning which I am speaking to you today; and you shall command your children to observe them carefully—to do all the words of this law. 47“For it is not an empty or trivial matter for you; indeed it is your [very] life. By [honoring and obeying] this word you will live long in the land, which you are crossing the Jordan to possess.”\n\n48And the LORD said to Moses that very same day, 49“Go up to this mountain of the Abarim, Mount Nebo, which is in the land of Moab opposite Jericho, and look at the land of Canaan, which I am giving to the sons of Israel as a possession. 50Then die on the mountain which you climb, and be gathered to your people [in death], just as Aaron your brother died on Mount Hor and was gathered to his people, 51because you broke faith with Me among of the sons of Israel at the waters of Meribah-kadesh, in the Wilderness of Zin, and because you did not treat Me as holy among of the sons of Israel. 52“For you shall see the land opposite you from a distance, but you shall not go there, into the land which I am giving to the children of Israel.”\n\nDeuteronomy 33\nThe Blessing Of Moses\n\n1This is the blessing with which Moses the man of God blessed the sons of Israel before his death. 2He said,\n“The LORD came from Sinai,\nAnd dawned on them from Seir;\nHe shone forth from Mount Paran,\nAnd He came from among ten thousand holy ones;\nAt His right hand was a flaming fire, a law, for them.\n3“Indeed, He loves His people;\nAll Your holy ones are in Your hand.\nThey followed in Your steps;\nThey accept and receive direction from You.\n4“Moses commanded us with a law,\nAs a possession for the assembly of Jacob.\n5“The LORD was King in Jeshurun (Israel),\nWhen the heads of the people were gathered,\nThe tribes of Israel together.\n6“May [the tribe of] Reuben live and not die out,\nBut let his men be few.”\n\n7And [Moses said] this of Judah:\n“Hear, O LORD, the voice of Judah,\nAnd bring him to his people.\nWith his hands he contended for them,\nAnd may You be a help against his enemies.”\n\n8Of Levi he said,\n“Your Thummim and Your Urim belong to Your godly man [Aaron],\nWhom You tested and proved at Massah,\nWith whom You contended at the waters of Meribah;\n9Who said of his father and mother,\n‘I did not consider them’;\nNor did he acknowledge his brothers,\nNor did he regard his own sons,\nFor the priests observed Your word,\nAnd kept Your covenant.\n10“The priests shall teach Your ordinances (judgments) to Jacob,\nAnd Your law to Israel.\nThey shall put incense before You,\nAnd whole burnt offerings on Your altar.\n11“O LORD, bless Levi’s substance (ability),\nAnd accept and take pleasure in the work of his hands;\nCrush and shatter the loins of those who rise up against him,\nAnd of those who hate him, so that they do not rise again.”\n\n12Of Benjamin he said,\n“May the beloved of the LORD dwell in safety by Him;\nHe shields and covers him all the day long,\nAnd he dwells between His shoulders.”\n\n13And of Joseph he said,\n“Blessed by the LORD be his land,\nWith the precious things of heaven, with the dew,\nAnd from the deep water that lies beneath,\n14With the precious fruits of the sun,\nAnd with the precious produce of the months.\n15“With the best things of the ancient mountains,\nAnd with the precious things of the everlasting hills,\n16With the precious things of the earth and its fullness,\nAnd the favor and goodwill of Him who dwelt in the bush.\nLet these blessings come upon the head of Joseph,\nAnd upon the crown of the head of him who was distinguished [as a prince] among his brothers.\n17“His majesty is like a firstborn young bull,\nAnd his horns like the horns of the wild ox;\nWith them he will gore the peoples,\nAll of them together, to the ends of the earth.\nAnd those are the ten thousands of Ephraim,\nAnd those are the thousands of Manasseh.”\n\n18Of Zebulun he said,\n“Rejoice, Zebulun, in your interests abroad,\nAnd, Issachar, in your tents [at home].\n19“They will call the peoples to the mountain (Mount Carmel);\nThere they will offer sacrifices of righteousness;\nFor they will draw out the abundance of the seas,\nAnd the hidden treasures of the sand.”\n\n20Of Gad he said,\n“Blessed is the one who enlarges Gad;\nHe lurks like a lioness,\nAnd tears the arm and the crown of the head.\n21“He selected the best [land] for himself,\nFor there the leader’s portion was reserved;\nYet he came with the leaders of the people;\nHe carried out the justice (righteous will) of the LORD,\nAnd His ordinances (judgments) with Israel.”\n\n22Of Dan he said,\n“Dan is a lion’s cub,\nThat leaps forth from Bashan.”\n\n23Of Naphtali he said,\n“O Naphtali, satisfied with favor,\nAnd full of the blessing of the LORD,\nTake possession of the sea [of Galilee] and the south.”\n\n24Of Asher he said,\n“More blessed than sons is Asher;\nMay he be favored by his brothers,\nAnd may he dip his foot in oil.\n25“Your strongholds will be iron and bronze,\nAnd as your days are, so will your strength, your rest and security be.\n26“There is none like the God of Jeshurun (Israel),\nWho rides the heavens to your help,\nAnd through the skies in His majestic glory.\n27“The eternal God is your refuge and dwelling place,\nAnd underneath are the everlasting arms;\nHe drove out the enemy from before you,\nAnd said, ‘Destroy!’\n28“So Israel dwells in safety and security,\nThe fountain of Jacob alone and secluded,\nIn a land of grain and new wine;\nHis heavens also drop down dew.\n29“Happy and blessed are you, O Israel;\nWho is like you, a people saved by the LORD,\nThe Shield of your help,\nAnd the Sword of your majesty!\nYour enemies will cringe before you,\nAnd you will tread on their high places [tramping down their idolatrous altars].”\n\nDeuteronomy 34\nThe Death Of Moses\n\n1Now Moses went up from the plains of Moab to Mount Nebo, to the top of Pisgah, that is opposite Jericho. And the LORD showed him all the land, from Gilead to Dan, 2and all Naphtali and the land of Ephraim and Manasseh, and all the land of Judah to the western sea (Mediterranean Sea), 3and the Negev (South country) and the plain in the Valley of Jericho, the city of palm trees, as far as Zoar. 4Then the LORD said to him, “This is the land which I swore to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying, ‘I will give it to your descendants.’ I have let you see it with your eyes, but you shall not go over there.” 5So Moses the servant of the LORD died there in the land of Moab, according to the word of the LORD. 6And He buried him in the valley in the land of Moab, opposite Beth-peor; but no man knows where his burial place is to this day. 7Although Moses was a hundred and twenty years old when he died, his eyesight was not dim, nor his natural strength abated. 8So the sons of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab for thirty days; then the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.\n\n9Now Joshua the son of Nun was filled with the spirit of wisdom, for Moses had laid his hands on him; so the sons of Israel listened to him and did as the LORD commanded Moses. 10Since that time no prophet has risen in Israel like Moses, whom the LORD knew face to face, 11[none equal to him] in all the signs and wonders which the LORD sent him to perform in the land of Egypt against Pharaoh, all his servants, and all his land, 12and in all the mighty power and all the great and terrible deeds which Moses performed in the sight of all Israel."

          "content": "Joshua 1\nGod’s Commission To Joshua\n\n1Now it happened after the death of Moses the servant of the LORD, that the LORD spoke to Joshua the son of Nun, Moses’ servant (attendant), saying, 2“Moses My servant is dead; now therefore arise [to take his place], cross over this Jordan, you and all this people, into the land which I am giving to them, to the sons of Israel. 3I have given you every place on which the sole of your foot treads, just as I promised to Moses. 4From the wilderness [of Arabia in the south] and this Lebanon [in the north], even as far as the great river, the river Euphrates [in the east], all the land of the Hittites (Canaan), and as far as the Great [Mediterranean] Sea toward the west shall be your territory. 5No man will [be able to] stand before you [to oppose you] as long as you live. Just as I was [present] with Moses, so will I be with you; I will not fail you or abandon you. 6Be strong and confident and courageous, for you will give this people as an inheritance the land which I swore to their fathers (ancestors) to give them. 7Only be strong and very courageous; be careful to do [everything] in accordance with the entire law which Moses My servant commanded you; do not turn from it to the right or to the left, so that you may prosper and be successful wherever you go. 8This Book of the Law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall read [and meditate on] it day and night, so that you may be careful to do [everything] in accordance with all that is written in it; for then you will make your way prosperous, and then you will be successful. 9“Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous! Do not be terrified or dismayed (intimidated), for the LORD your God is with you wherever you go.”\n\nJoshua Assumes Command 10Then Joshua commanded the officers of the people, saying, 11“Go throughout the camp and command the people, saying, ‘Prepare your provisions, for within three days you are to cross this [river] Jordan, to go in to take possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving you to possess [as an inheritance].’”\n\n12To the Reubenites and to the Gadites and to the half-tribe of Manasseh, Joshua said, 13“Remember the word which Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, saying, ‘The LORD your God is giving you rest (peace) and will give you this land [east of the Jordan].’ 14Your wives, your children, and your cattle shall [be allowed to] stay in the land which Moses gave you on this [eastern] side of the Jordan, but you shall go across [the river] before your brothers (the other tribes) armed for battle, all your brave warriors, and you shall help them [conquer and take possession of their land], 15until the LORD gives your brothers rest, as He has given you, and they also take possession of the land which the LORD your God is giving them. Then you shall [be allowed to] return to your own land, and take possession of that which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the Jordan toward the sunrise.”\n\n16They answered Joshua, saying, “All that you have commanded us we will do, and wherever you send us we will go. 17Just as we obeyed Moses in all things, so will we obey you; only may the LORD your God be with you as He was with Moses. 18“Any man who rebels against your command and does not obey everything that you command him, shall be put to death; only be strong and courageous.”\n\nJoshua 2\nRahab Shelters Spies\n\n1Joshua the son of Nun sent two men as scouts secretly from Shittim, saying, “Go, view the land, especially Jericho [the walled city].” So they went and came to the house of a prostitute named Rahab, and lodged there. 2Now the king of Jericho was told, “Behold, men from the sons of Israel have come here tonight to spy and search out the land.” 3So the king of Jericho sent word to Rahab, saying, “Bring out the men who have come to you, who entered your house, because they have come [as spies] to search out all the land.” 4But the woman had taken the two men and hidden them; so she said, “Yes, two men came to me, but I did not know where they were from. 5“When it was time to close the [city] gate at dark, the men left; I do not know where they went. Pursue them quickly, for [if you do] you will overtake them.” 6But [in fact] she had brought the scouts up to the roof and had hidden them under the stalks of flax which she had laid in order on the roof [to dry]. 7So the [king’s] men pursued them on the road to the Jordan as far as the fords [east of Jericho]; as soon as the pursuers had gone out after them, the gate [of the city] was shut.\n\n8Now before the two men lay down [to sleep], Rahab came up to them on the roof, 9and she said to the men, “I know that the LORD has given you the land, and that the terror and dread of you has fallen on us, and that all the inhabitants of the land have melted [in despair] because of you. 10For we have heard how the LORD dried up the water of the Red Sea for you when you came out of Egypt, and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan [on the east], to Sihon and Og, whom you utterly destroyed. 11When we heard it, our hearts melted [in despair], and a [fighting] spirit no longer remained in any man because of you; for the LORD your God, He is God in heaven above and on earth beneath. 12And now, please swear [an oath] to me by the LORD, since I have shown you kindness, that you also will show kindness to my father’s household (family), and give me a pledge of truth and faithfulness, 13and spare my father and my mother and my brothers and my sisters, along with everyone who belongs to them, and let us all live.” 14So the men said to her, “Our lives for yours if you do not tell [anyone about] this business of ours; then when the LORD gives us the land we will show you kindness and faithfulness [and keep our agreement with you].”\n\nThe Promise to Rahab 15Then she let them down by a rope through the window, for her house was built into the city wall, so that she was living on the wall. 16And she said to them, “Go [west] to the hill country, so that the pursuers [who have headed east] will not encounter you; hide yourselves there for three days until the pursuers return. Then afterward you can go your way.” 17The men said to her, “We shall be blameless and free from this oath which you have made us swear, 18unless, when we come into the land, you tie this cord of scarlet thread in the window through which you let us down, and bring into the house your father and your mother and your brothers and all your father’s household [so that they will be safe]. 19But if anyone goes out the doors of your house into the street, his blood shall be on his own head [that is, his own responsibility], and we shall be blameless and free [from our oath]; however, if a hand is laid on anyone who is with you in the house, his blood shall be on our head. 20“But if you tell [anyone] this business of ours, we shall be blameless and free from the oath which you made us swear.” 21She said, “According to your words, so be it.” Then Rahab sent them off, and they departed; and she tied the scarlet cord in the window.\n\n22They left and went [on their way] to the hill country [west of Jericho], and stayed there [hidden in the caves] three days until the pursuers returned. The pursuers had searched all along the road but had not found them. 23Then the two men turned back and came down from the hill country and crossed over [the Jordan] and came to Joshua the son of Nun [at Shittim], and told him everything that had happened to them. 24They said to Joshua, “Certainly the LORD has given all the land into our hands; for all the inhabitants of the land have melted [in despair] because of us.”\n\nJoshua 3\nIsrael Crosses The Jordan\n\n1Joshua got up early in the morning; then he and all the children of Israel set out from Shittim and came to the Jordan, and they spent the night there before they crossed [the river]. 2And it happened at the end of three days that the officers went throughout the camp, 3and they commanded the people, “When you see the ark of the covenant of the LORD your God being carried by the Levitical priests, then you shall set out from where you are and follow it. 4“However, there shall be a distance between you and it of about 2,000 cubits (3,000 ft.) by measurement. Do not come near it, so that you may [be able to see the ark and] know the way you are to go, for you have not passed this way before.”\n\n5Then Joshua said to the people, “Sanctify yourselves [for His purpose], for tomorrow the LORD will do wonders (miracles) among you.” 6Joshua said to the priests, “Take up the ark of the covenant and cross over [the river] ahead of the people.” So they took up the ark of the covenant and went on ahead of the people.\n\n7The LORD said to Joshua, “This day I will begin to magnify and exalt you in the sight of all Israel, so that they may know that just as I was with Moses, I will [also] be with you. 8“You shall command the priests who carry the ark of the covenant, saying, ‘When you come to the edge of the waters of the Jordan, you shall stand still in the Jordan.’” 9Joshua said to the Israelites, “Come here, and listen to the words of the LORD your God.” 10Joshua said, “By this you shall know that the living God is among you, and that He will, without fail, drive out from before you the Canaanite, the Hittite, the Hivite, the Perizzite, the Girgashite, the Amorite, and the Jebusite. 11Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth is crossing over ahead of you [leading the way] into the Jordan. 12So now take for yourselves twelve men from the tribes of Israel, one man from each tribe. 13“When the soles of the feet of the priests who carry the ark of the LORD, the Lord of all the earth, [come to] rest in the waters of the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan flowing down from above will be cut off, and they will stand in one mass [of water].”\n\n14So when the people set out from their tents to cross over the Jordan with the priests who were carrying the ark of the covenant before the people, 15and when those who were carrying the ark came up to the Jordan, and the feet of the priests carrying the ark were submerged at the edge of the water (for the Jordan overflows all of its banks throughout the time of harvest), 16the waters which were flowing down from above stopped and rose up in one mass a great distance away at Adam, the city that is beside Zarethan. Those [waters] flowing downward toward the sea of the Arabah, the Salt Sea, were completely cut off. So the people crossed [the river] opposite Jericho. 17And while all [the people of] Israel crossed over on dry ground, the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD stood firm on dry ground in the midst of the Jordan [riverbed], until all the nation had finished crossing over the Jordan.\nJoshua 4\nMemorial Stones From Jordan\n\n1So it was when all the nation had finished crossing the Jordan, the LORD said to Joshua, 2“Take for yourselves the twelve men [chosen] from among the people, one man from each tribe, 3and command them, ‘Pick up for yourselves twelve stones [one each] from here out of the midst of the Jordan, from the place where the priests’ feet are standing firm; carry them over with you and lay them down at the place where you will spend the night tonight.’” 4Then Joshua called the twelve men whom he had appointed from the sons of Israel, one man from each tribe; 5and Joshua said to them, “Cross over again to the ark of the LORD your God into the midst of the Jordan, and each of you take up a stone on his shoulder, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, 6so that this may be a sign among you; when your children ask later, ‘What do these stones mean to you?’ 7then you shall say to them that the waters of the Jordan were cut off before the ark of the covenant of the LORD; when it crossed the Jordan, the waters of the Jordan were cut off. So these stones shall become a memorial for Israel forever.”\n\n8So the [twelve men chosen from the] sons of Israel did as Joshua commanded, and took up twelve stones out of the midst of the Jordan, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Israel, just as the LORD had spoken to Joshua; and they carried them over with them to the place where they were spending the night and put them down there. 9Then Joshua set up [a second monument of] twelve stones in the midst of the Jordan at the place where the feet of the priests who carried the ark of the covenant were standing, and they are there to this day. 10For the priests who carried the ark were standing in the midst of the Jordan until everything was finished that the LORD had commanded Joshua to tell the people, in accordance with everything that Moses had commanded Joshua. The people hurried and crossed [the dry riverbed]; 11and when all the people had finished crossing, the ark of the LORD and the priests crossed over in the presence of the people. 12The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and half the tribe of Manasseh crossed over armed for battle before the [other] sons of Israel, just as Moses had spoken to them; 13about 40,000 [men] armed and equipped for war crossed for battle before the LORD to the desert plains of Jericho.\n\n14On that day the LORD magnified and exalted Joshua in the sight of all Israel; so they feared him [with profound awe and reverence], just as they had feared Moses all the days of his life.\n\n15Now the LORD said to Joshua, 16“Order the priests carrying the ark of the Testimony to come up out of the Jordan.” 17So Joshua commanded the priests, saying, “Come up out of the Jordan.” 18When the priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD had come up from the midst of the Jordan, and the soles of their feet were raised up to the dry land, the waters of the Jordan returned to their place, and flowed over all its banks as before.\n\n19Now the people came up from the Jordan on the tenth [day] of the first month and encamped at Gilgal on the eastern border of Jericho. 20And those twelve stones which they had taken from the Jordan, Joshua set up in Gilgal. 21He said to the sons of Israel, “When your children ask their fathers in time to come, ‘What do these stones mean?’ 22then you shall let your children know, ‘Israel crossed this Jordan on dry ground.’ 23For the LORD your God dried up the waters of the Jordan for you until you crossed over, just as the LORD your God did to the Red Sea, which He dried up before us until we had crossed; 24so that all the peoples of the earth may know [without any doubt] and acknowledge that the hand of the LORD is mighty and extraordinarily powerful, so that you will fear the LORD your God [and obey and worship Him with profound awe and reverence] forever.”\n\nJoshua 5\nIsrael Is Circumcised\n\n1Now it happened when all the kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan to the west, and all the kings of the Canaanites who were by the sea, heard that the LORD had dried up the waters of the Jordan before the Israelites until they had crossed over, their hearts melted [in despair], and there was no [fighting] spirit in them any longer because of the Israelites [and what God had done for them].\n\n2At that time the LORD said to Joshua, “Make for yourself flint knives and circumcise the [new generation of the] sons of Israel as [was done] before.” 3So Joshua made flint knives and circumcised the sons of Israel at Gibeath-haaraloth. 4This is the reason why Joshua circumcised them: all the people who came out of Egypt who were males, all the men of war, had died in the wilderness along the way after they left Egypt. 5All the males who came out were circumcised, but all the males who were born in the wilderness on the way as they left Egypt had not been circumcised. 6For the Israelites walked forty years in the wilderness, until all the nation, that is, the men of war who came out of Egypt, died because they did not listen to the voice of the LORD; to them the LORD had sworn [an oath] that He would not let them see the land which He had promised to their fathers to give us, a land [of abundance] flowing with milk and honey. 7So it was their uncircumcised sons whom He raised up in their place, whom Joshua circumcised, because circumcision had not been performed on the way.\n\n8Then, when they had finished circumcising all [the males of] the nation, they stayed in their places in the camp until they were healed. 9Then the LORD said to Joshua, “This day I have rolled away the reproach (derision, ridicule) of Egypt from you.” So the name of that place is called Gilgal (rolling) to this day.\n\n10While the Israelites camped at Gilgal they observed the Passover on the evening of the fourteenth day of the month on the desert plains of Jericho. 11On the day after Passover, on that very day, they ate some of the produce of the land, unleavened bread, and roasted grain. 12And the manna ceased on the day after they had eaten some of the produce of the land, so that the Israelites no longer had manna, but they ate some of the produce of the land of Canaan during that year.\n\n13Now when Joshua was by Jericho, he looked up, and behold, a man was standing opposite him with his drawn sword in his hand, and Joshua went to him and said to him, “Are you for us or for our adversaries?” 14He said, “No; rather I have come now as captain of the army of the LORD.” Then Joshua fell with his face toward the earth and bowed down, and said to him, “What does my lord have to say to his servant?” 15The captain of the LORD’S army said to Joshua, “Remove your sandals from your feet, because the place where you are standing is holy (set apart to the LORD).” And Joshua did so.\n\nJoshua 6\nThe Conquest Of Jericho\n\n1Now Jericho [a fortified city with high walls] was tightly closed because [of the people’s fear] of the sons of Israel; no one went out or came in. 2The LORD said to Joshua, “See, I have given Jericho into your hand, with its king and the mighty warriors. 3Now you shall march around the city, all the men of war circling the city once. You shall do this [once each day] for six days. 4Also, seven priests shall carry seven trumpets [made] of rams’ horns ahead of the ark; then on the seventh day you shall march around the city seven times, and the priests shall blow the trumpets. 5“When they make a long blast with the ram’s horn, and when you hear the sound of the trumpet, all the people shall cry out with a great shout (battle cry); and the wall of the city will fall down in its place, and the people shall go up, each man [going] straight ahead [climbing over the rubble].”\n\n6So Joshua the son of Nun called for the priests and said to them, “Take up the ark of the covenant, and have seven priests carry seven trumpets made of rams’ horns ahead of the ark of the LORD.” 7He said to the people, “Go forward! March around the city, and let the armed men go ahead of the ark of the LORD.” 8And it was so, that when Joshua had spoken to the people, the seven priests carrying the seven trumpets made of rams’ horns went on before the LORD and blew the trumpets; then the ark of the covenant of the LORD went behind them. 9The armed men went in front of the priests who blew the trumpets, and the rear guard came after the ark, while the priests continued to blow the trumpets. 10But Joshua commanded the people, “You shall not shout [the battle cry] nor let your voice be heard nor let a word come out of your mouth, until the day I tell you to shout. Then you shall shout!” 11So Joshua had the ark of the LORD taken around the city [on the first day], circling it once; then they came back into the camp and spent the night in the camp.\n\n12Then Joshua got up early in the morning [on the second day], and the priests took up the ark of the LORD. 13The seven priests carrying the seven trumpets made of rams’ horns ahead of the ark of the LORD went on continually, blowing the trumpets; and the armed men went ahead of them and the rear guard came after the ark of the LORD, while the priests continued to blow the trumpets. 14On the second day they marched around the city once, and returned to the camp; they did this for six days.\n\n15Then on the seventh day they got up early at daybreak and marched around the city in the same way seven times; only on that day they marched around the city seven times. 16And the seventh time, when the priests had blown the trumpets, Joshua said to the people, “Shout! For the LORD has given you the city. 17The city and everything that is in it shall be under the ban [that is, designated to be destroyed as a form of tribute] to the LORD; only Rahab the prostitute and all [the people] who are with her in her house shall [be allowed to] live, because she hid and protected the messengers (scouts) whom we sent. 18But as for you, keep yourselves [away] from the things under the ban [which are to be destroyed], so that you do not covet them and take some of the things under the ban [for personal gain], and put the camp of Israel under the ban (doomed to destruction), and bring disaster upon it. 19“All the silver and gold and articles of bronze and iron are holy (consecrated) to the LORD; they shall go into the treasury of the LORD.” 20So the people shouted [the battle cry], and the priests blew the trumpets. When the people heard the sound of the trumpet, they raised a great shout and the wall [of Jericho] fell down, so that the sons of Israel went up into the city, every man straight ahead [climbing over the rubble], and they overthrew the city. 21Then they utterly destroyed everything that was in the city, both man and woman, young and old, and ox and sheep and donkey, with the edge of the sword.\n\n22But Joshua said to the two men who had spied out the land, “Go into the prostitute’s house and bring the woman and all that she has out of there, as you have sworn to her.” 23So the young men, the spies, went in and brought out Rahab and her father and her mother and her brothers and everything that she had; they also brought out all her relatives and allowed them to stay outside the camp of Israel [at Gilgal during the time required for ceremonial cleansing]. 24Then they completely burned the city and everything that was in it. They put only the silver and the gold, and the articles of bronze and of iron, into the treasury of the house (tabernacle) of the LORD. 25So Joshua spared Rahab the prostitute, with her father’s household and everything that she had; and she has lived among Israel to this day, because she hid the messengers (scouts) whom Joshua sent to spy out Jericho.\n\n26Then Joshua made them take an oath at that time, saying, “Cursed before the LORD is the man who rises up and rebuilds this city, Jericho; with the loss of his firstborn he shall lay its foundation, and with the loss of his youngest son he shall set up its gates.” 27So the LORD was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land.\nJoshua 7\nIsrael Is Defeated At Ai\n\n1But the sons of Israel acted unfaithfully and violated their obligation in regard to the things [off limits] under the ban [those things belonging to the LORD], for Achan, the son of Carmi, the son of Zabdi, the son of Zerah, from the tribe of Judah, took some of the things under the ban [for personal gain]. Therefore the anger of the LORD burned against the Israelites.\n\n2Now Joshua sent men from Jericho to Ai, which is near Beth-aven, east of Bethel, and said to them, “Go up and spy out the land.” So the men went up and spied out Ai. 3Then they returned to Joshua and said to him, “Do not make all the people go up [to fight]; have only about two thousand or three thousand men go up and attack Ai; do not make the entire army go up there, for they [of Ai] are few.” 4So about three thousand men from the sons of Israel went up there, but they fled [in retreat] from the men of Ai. 5The men of Ai killed about thirty-six of Israel’s men, and chased them from the gate as far as [the bluffs of] Shebarim and struck them down as they descended [the steep pass], so the hearts of the people melted [in despair and began to doubt God’s promise] and became like water (disheartened).\n\n6Then Joshua tore his clothes and fell face downward on the ground before the ark of the LORD until evening, he and the elders of Israel; and [with great sorrow] they put dust on their heads. 7Joshua said, “Alas, O Lord GOD, why have You brought this people across the Jordan at all, only to hand us over to the Amorites, to destroy us? If only we had been willing to live beyond the Jordan! 😯 Lord, what can I say now that [the army of] Israel has turned back [in retreat and fled] before their enemies? 9“For the Canaanites and all the inhabitants of the land will hear about it, and will surround us and cut off our name from the earth. And what will You do for Your great name [to keep it from dishonor]?”\n\n10So the LORD said to Joshua, “Get up! Why is it that you have fallen on your face? 11Israel has sinned; they have also transgressed My covenant which I commanded them [to keep]. They have even taken some of the things under the ban, and they have both stolen and denied [the theft]. Moreover, they have also put the stolen objects among their own things. 12That is why the soldiers of Israel could not stand [and defend themselves] before their enemies; they turned their backs [and ran] before them, because they have become accursed. I will not be with you anymore unless you destroy the things under the ban from among you. 13“Rise up! Consecrate the people and say, ‘Consecrate yourselves for tomorrow, for thus says the LORD, the God of Israel: “There are things under the ban among you, O Israel. You cannot stand [victorious] before your enemies until you remove the things under the ban from among you.” 14‘In the morning you shall come forward by your tribes. And it shall be that the tribe which the LORD chooses by lot shall come forward by families, and the family which the LORD chooses shall come forward by [separate] households, and the household which the LORD chooses shall come forward man by man. 15‘It shall be that the one who is chosen with the things under the ban shall be [killed and his body] burned with fire, he and all that belongs to him, because he has transgressed the covenant of the LORD, and because he has done a disgraceful and disobedient thing in Israel.’”\n\nThe Sin of Achan 16So Joshua got up early in the morning and had Israel come forward by tribes, and the tribe of Judah was chosen [by lot]. 17He had the families of Judah come forward, and the family of the Zerahites was chosen; and he had the family of the Zerahites come forward man by man, and Zabdi was chosen. 18He brought his household forward man by man; and Achan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was chosen. 19Then Joshua said to Achan, “My son, I implore you, give glory to the LORD, the God of Israel, and give praise to Him [in recognition of His righteous judgments]; and tell me now what you have done. Do not hide it from me.” 20So Achan answered Joshua and said, “In truth, I have sinned against the LORD, the God of Israel, and this is what I have done: 21when I saw among the spoils [in Jericho] a beautiful robe from Shinar (southern Babylon) and two hundred shekels of silver and a bar of gold weighing fifty shekels, I wanted them and took them. Behold, they are hidden in the ground inside my tent, with the silver underneath.”\n\n22So Joshua sent messengers, and they ran to the tent; and they saw the stolen objects hidden in his tent, with the silver underneath. 23And they took them from the tent and brought them to Joshua and to all the sons of Israel, and spread them out before the LORD. 24Then Joshua and all Israel with him, took Achan the son of Zerah, the silver, the [royal] robe, the bar of gold, his sons, his daughters, his oxen, his donkeys, his sheep, his tent, and everything that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor (Disaster). 25Joshua said, “Why have you brought disaster on us? The LORD will bring you disaster this day.” Then all Israel stoned them [to death] with stones; afterward they burned their bodies in the fire. 26Then they piled up over him a great heap of stones that remains to this day. Then the LORD turned from the fierceness of His anger. Therefore the name of that place has been called the Valley of Achor (Disaster) to this day.\n\nJoshua 8\nThe Conquest Of Ai\n\n1Now the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear or be dismayed (intimidated). Take all the men of war with you and set out, go up to Ai; see, I have given the king of Ai, his people, his city, and his land into your hand. 2“You shall do [the same] to Ai and its king as you did to Jericho and its king; [except that] you shall take only its spoil and its cattle as plunder for yourselves. Set up an ambush for the city behind it [on the west side].”\n\n3So Joshua set out with all the people of war to go up against Ai; then Joshua chose thirty thousand valiant men, and sent them out at night. 4He commanded them, saying, “Listen closely, you are going to lie in wait and ambush the city from behind it. Do not go very far away from the city, but all of you be ready. 5Then I and all the people who are with me will approach the city. And when they come out to meet us [for battle] as [they did] the first time, we will run away from them. 6They will come out after us until we have lured them away from the city, because they will say, ‘They are running from us as [they did] before.’ So we will run from them. 7Then you will emerge from the ambush and take possession of the city, for the LORD your God will hand it over to you. 8“When you have taken the city, you shall set it on fire; you shall do [exactly] as the LORD commanded. See, I have commanded you.” 9So Joshua sent them off, and they went to the place for the ambush and stayed [hidden] between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of Ai; but Joshua spent that night among the people [in Gilgal].\n\n10Now Joshua got up early in the morning and assembled the people, and went up with the elders of Israel before the people to Ai. 11Then all the fighting men who were with him went up and advanced and arrived in front of the city, and camped on the north side of Ai. Now there was a ravine between them and Ai. 12And Joshua took about five thousand men and set them in ambush between Bethel and Ai, on the west side of the city. 13So they stationed the people, all the army—the main encampment that was north of the city, and their rear guard on the west side of the city—and Joshua spent that night in the valley. 14Now when the king [and the people] of Ai saw it, the men of the city hurried and got up early and went out to meet Israel in battle, the king and all his people at the appointed [time and] place before the desert plain (the Arabah). But he did not know that there was an ambush against him [waiting] behind the city [on the west side]. 15So Joshua and all Israel pretended to be defeated by them, and ran toward the wilderness. 16Then all the people who were in the city were called together to pursue them, and they pursued Joshua and were lured away from the city. 17Not a man was left in Ai or Bethel who had not gone out after Israel; so they left the city open and unguarded and they pursued Israel.\n\n18Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Reach out with the spear that is in your hand [and point it] toward Ai, for I will give it into your hand.” So Joshua reached out with the spear in his hand [and pointed it] toward the city. 19The [men in] ambush emerged quickly from their [hiding] place, and when Joshua stretched out his hand they ran and entered the city and captured it, and quickly set the city on fire. 20When the men of Ai turned back and looked, behold, the smoke of the city was ascending toward the sky, and they had no opportunity to run this way or that way. Then the people who had been running to the wilderness turned back toward the pursuers. 21When Joshua and all Israel saw that the [men in] ambush had taken the city and that the smoke of the city was ascending, they turned back and struck down the men of Ai. 22Then the others came out of the city to confront the men of Ai [as they returned], so that they were trapped in the midst of Israel, some on this side and some on that side; then Israel struck them until none of them survived or escaped. 23But they took the king of Ai alive and brought him to Joshua.\n\n24When Israel had finished killing all the inhabitants of Ai in the field in the wilderness where they pursued them, and they had all fallen by the edge of the sword until they were destroyed, then all Israel returned to Ai and struck it with the edge of the sword. 25And all who fell that day, both men and women, were twelve thousand, all the people of Ai. 26For Joshua did not withdraw his hand with which he stretched out the spear until he had utterly destroyed all the inhabitants of Ai. 27Israel took only the livestock and the spoil of that city as plunder for themselves, according to the word of the LORD which He had commanded Joshua. 28So Joshua burned Ai and made it a rubbish heap forever, a desolation until this day. 29He hanged [the body of] the king of Ai on a tree [leaving it there] until evening; at sunset Joshua gave a command and they took the body down from the tree and dumped it at the entrance of the city gate, and piled a great heap of stones over it that stands to this day.\n\n30Then Joshua built an altar to the LORD, the God of Israel, on Mount Ebal, 31just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded the sons of Israel, as it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, an altar of uncut stones on which no one has wielded an iron tool; and they offered on it burnt offerings to the LORD, and sacrificed peace offerings. 32And there, in the presence of the sons of Israel, Joshua wrote on the stones a copy of the Law of Moses which Moses had written. 33All Israel, the stranger as well as the native born [among them], with their elders and officers and their judges, stood on either side of the ark before the Levitical priests who carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD. Half of them stood in front of Mount Gerizim and half of them in front of Mount Ebal, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded at first to bless the people of Israel. 34Then afterward Joshua read all the words of the law, the blessing and curse, according to all that is written in the Book of the Law. 35There was not a word of all that Moses had commanded which Joshua did not read before the entire assembly of Israel, including the women and the children and the foreigners who were living among them.\n\nJoshua 9\nGuile Of The Gibeonites\n\n1Now when all the kings who were beyond the Jordan, in the hill country and in the lowland [at the western edge of the hills of Judea], and all along the coast of the Great [Mediterranean] Sea toward Lebanon, the Hittite and the Amorite, the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite, heard of this [army and its victories over Jericho and Ai], 2they gathered together with one purpose to fight with Joshua and with Israel.\n\n3But when the people of Gibeon [the Hivites] heard what Joshua had done to Jericho and Ai, 4they too acted craftily and cunningly, and set out and took along provisions, but took worn-out sacks on their donkeys, and wineskins (leather bottles) that were worn out and split open and patched together, 5and worn-out and patched sandals on their feet, and worn-out clothes; and all their supply of food was dry and had turned to crumbs. 6They went to Joshua in the camp at Gilgal and said to him and the men of Israel, “We have come from a far country; so now, make a covenant (treaty) with us.” 7But the men of Israel said to the Hivites, “Perhaps you are living within our land; how then can we make a covenant (treaty) with you?” 8They said to Joshua, “We are your servants.” Then Joshua said to them, “Who are you, and where do you come from?” 9They said to him, “Your servants have come from a country that is very far away because of the fame of the LORD your God; for we have heard the news about Him and all [the remarkable things] that He did in Egypt, 10and everything that He did to the two kings of the Amorites who were beyond the Jordan, to Sihon the king of Heshbon and to Og the king of Bashan who lived in Ashtaroth. 11“So our elders and all the residents of our country said to us, ‘Take provisions for the journey and go to meet the sons of Israel and say to them, “We are your servants; now make a covenant (treaty) with us.”’ 12This bread of ours was hot (fresh) when we took it along as our provision from our houses on the day we left to come to you; now look, it is dry and has turned to crumbs. 13“These wineskins which we filled were new, and look, they are split; our clothes and our sandals are worn out because of the very long journey [that we had to make].” 14So the men [of Israel] took some of their own provisions [and offered them in friendship], and [foolishly] did not ask for the counsel of the LORD. 15Joshua made peace with them and made a covenant (treaty) with them, to let them live; and the leaders of the congregation [of Israel] swore an oath to them.\n\n16It happened that three days after they had made a covenant (treaty) with them, the Israelites heard that they were [actually] their neighbors and that they were living among them. 17Then the sons of Israel set out and came to their cities on the third day. Now the cities [of the Hivites] were Gibeon and Chephirah and Beeroth and Kiriath-jearim. 18But the sons of Israel did not strike them because the leaders of the congregation had sworn to them by the LORD the God of Israel [to spare them]. And all the congregation murmured [expressing great dissatisfaction] against the leaders. 19But all the leaders said to the whole congregation, “We have sworn to them by the LORD, the God of Israel, so now we cannot touch them. 20“This [is what] we will do to them: we will let them live, so that the wrath [of God] does not come upon us for [violating] the oath which we have sworn to them.” 21The leaders said to them, “Let them live [as our slaves].” So they became the cutters and gatherers of firewood and water carriers for the entire congregation, just as the leaders had said of them.\n\n22Joshua called the [Hivite] men and said, “Why did you deceive us, saying, ‘We live very far away from you,’ when [in fact] you live among us? 23“Now therefore, you are cursed, and you shall always be slaves, both cutters and gatherers of firewood and water carriers for the house of my God.” 24They replied to Joshua and said, “Because your servants were told in no uncertain terms that the LORD your God commanded His servant Moses to give you all the land, and to destroy all the land’s inhabitants before you, we feared greatly for our lives because of you, and so we did this [deceptive] thing. 25“Now look, we are in your hands; do to us as it seems good and right in your sight.” 26So that is what he did to them; he rescued them from the hands of the Israelites and they did not kill them. 27Now on that day Joshua made them cutters and gatherers of firewood and water carriers for the congregation and for the altar of the LORD, to this day, in the place which He would choose.\n\nJoshua 10\nFive Kings Attack Gibeon\n\n1When Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem heard that Joshua had captured Ai, and had utterly destroyed it—as he had done to Jericho and its king, so he had done to Ai and its king—and that the residents of Gibeon had made peace with Israel and were [living] among them, 2he [and his people] feared greatly, because Gibeon was a great city, like one of the royal cities, and because it was greater than Ai, and all its men were mighty. 3So Adoni-zedek king of Jerusalem sent word to Hoham king of Hebron, and to Piram king of Jarmuth, to Japhia king of Lachish, and to Debir king of Eglon, saying, 4“Come up to me and help me, and let us attack Gibeon [with a combined army], because it has made peace with Joshua and with the sons (people) of Israel.” 5Then the five kings of the Amorites, the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon, gathered together and went up, they with all their armies, and they camped by Gibeon and fought against it.\n\n6So the men of Gibeon sent word to Joshua at the camp in Gilgal, saying, “Do not abandon your servants; come up to us quickly and save us and help us, for all [five of] the kings of the Amorites who live in the hill country have assembled against us.” 7So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him, and all the men of valor. 8The LORD said to Joshua, “Do not fear them, because I have given them into your hand; not one of them shall stand before you.” 9So Joshua came upon them suddenly, [surprising them] by marching [uphill] all night from Gilgal. 10And the LORD caused them to panic and be confused before Israel, and He struck them dead in a great slaughter at Gibeon, and chased them along the way that goes up to Beth-horon and struck them as far as Azekah and Makkedah. 11As they fled before Israel, while they were at the descent of Beth-horon, the LORD threw down large stones [of hail] from heaven on them as far as Azekah, and they died. More [Amorites] died because of the hailstones than those whom the sons of Israel killed with the sword.\n\n12Then Joshua spoke to the LORD on the day when the LORD handed over the Amorites to the sons of Israel, and Joshua said in the sight of Israel,\n“Sun, stand still at Gibeon,\nAnd moon, in the Valley of Aijalon.”\n13So the sun stood still, and the moon stopped,\nUntil the nation [of Israel] took vengeance upon their enemies.\nIs it not written in the Book of Jashar? So the sun stood still in the middle of the sky and was in no hurry to go down for about a whole day. 14There has not been a day like that before it or after it, when the LORD listened to (heeded) the voice of a man; for the LORD was fighting for Israel.\n\n15Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.\n\nVictory at Makkedah 16Now these five [Amorite] kings fled and hid themselves in the cave at Makkedah. 17And Joshua was told, “The five kings have been found and are hidden in the cave at Makkedah.” 18Joshua said, “Roll large stones against the mouth of the cave, and assign men by it to guard them, 19but do not stay there yourselves; pursue your enemies and attack them from the rear. Do not allow them to enter their cities, for the LORD your God has given them into your hand.” 20Now when Joshua and the sons of Israel had finished striking the Amorites dead in a very great defeat, until they were wiped out, and the surviving remnant among them had entered the fortified cities, 21all the people returned to the camp to Joshua at Makkedah in peace. No one uttered a [threatening] word against any of the sons of Israel.\n\n22Then Joshua said, “Open the mouth of the cave and bring out to me those five [Amorite] kings from the cave.” 23They did so, and brought these five [Amorite] kings out of the cave to him—the king of Jerusalem, the king of Hebron, the king of Jarmuth, the king of Lachish, and the king of Eglon. 24When they brought these kings out to Joshua, Joshua called for all the men of Israel, and told the commanders of the men of war who had gone with him, “Come up close, put your feet on the necks of these kings.” So they came forward and put their feet on the necks [of the five kings]. 25Joshua said to them, “Do not fear or be dismayed (intimidated)! Be strong and courageous, for this is what the LORD will do to all your enemies against whom you [are about to] fight.” 26Then afterward Joshua struck them [with his sword] and put them to death, and he hung them on five trees; and they hung on the trees until evening. 27At sunset Joshua gave a command, and they took the bodies down from the trees and threw them into the cave where the kings had hidden themselves, and placed large stones over the mouth of the cave, [where they remain] to this very day.\n\n28Now Joshua captured Makkedah on that day, and struck it and its king with the edge of the sword; he utterly destroyed it and everyone who was in it. He left no survivor. So he did to the king of Makkedah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.\n\nJoshua’s Conquest of Southern Canaan 29Then Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Makkedah to Libnah, and fought against Libnah. 30The LORD gave it also along with its king into the hands of Israel, and Joshua struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor in it. So he did to the king of Libnah just as he had done to the king of Jericho.\n\n31And Joshua and all Israel with him moved on from Libnah to Lachish, and they camped by it and fought against it. 32The LORD gave Lachish into the hands of Israel; and Joshua captured it on the second day, and struck it and every person who was in it with the edge of the sword, just as he had done to Libnah.\n\n33Then Horam king of Gezer went up to help Lachish, and Joshua struck him and his people down until he had left him no survivor.\n\n34And Joshua and all Israel with him went on from Lachish to Eglon, and they camped by it and fought against it. 35They captured it on that day and struck it with the edge of the sword; and on that day he utterly destroyed every person who was in it, just as he had done to Lachish.\n\n36Then Joshua and all Israel with him went up from Eglon to Hebron, and they fought against it 37and captured it and struck it and its king and all its cities and all the persons who were in it with the edge of the sword. He left no survivor, just as he had done to Eglon. He utterly destroyed it and every person who was in it.\n\n38Then Joshua and all Israel with him returned to Debir, and fought against it. 39He captured it with its king and all its cities, and they struck them with the edge of the sword, and utterly destroyed every person who was in it. He left no survivor. Just as he had done to Hebron, so Joshua did to Debir and its king, as he had done also to Libnah and its king.\n\n40So Joshua struck all the land, the hill country, the Negev (South country) and the lowland and the slopes [that descend to the Dead Sea] and all their kings. He left no survivor, but he utterly destroyed all who breathed, just as the LORD, the God of Israel, had commanded. 41Joshua struck them from Kadesh-barnea even as far as Gaza, and all the country of Goshen even as far as Gibeon. 42Joshua captured all these kings and their land at one time, because the LORD, the God of Israel, fought for Israel. 43So Joshua and all Israel with him returned to the camp at Gilgal.\n\nJoshua 11\nNorthern Canaan Taken\n\n1Then when Jabin king of Hazor heard [of Israel’s other victories] he sent word to Jobab king of Madon, and to the king of Shimron, and to the king of Achshaph, 2and to the kings who were in the north, in the hill country, and in the Arabah [the plain] south of Chinnereth (the Sea of Galilee) and in the lowland and on the hills of Dor on the west; 3to the Canaanite in the east and in the west, and to the Amorite, the Hittite, the Perizzite, and the Jebusite in the hill country, and the Hivite at the foot of [Mount] Hermon in the land of Mizpeh. 4They went out, they and all their armies with them, as many people as the sand on the seashore, with very many horses and chariots. 5So all these kings met and they came and encamped together at the waters of Merom, to fight against Israel.\n\n6Then the LORD said to Joshua, “Do not be afraid because of them, for tomorrow by this time I am going to hand over all of them slain [by the sword] to Israel; you shall hamstring (disable) their horses and set fire to their chariots.” 7So Joshua and all the people of war with him came against them suddenly by the waters of Merom, and attacked them. 8The LORD handed them over to Israel, who struck them and pursued them as far as Great Sidon and Misrephoth-maim and eastward as far as the Valley of Mizpeh; they struck them down until no survivor was left. 9Joshua did to them as the LORD had told him; he hamstrung (disabled) their horses and set fire to their chariots.\n\n10At that time Joshua turned back and captured Hazor and struck its king dead with the sword; for Hazor previously was the head of all these kingdoms. 11They struck all the people who were in it with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them; there was no one left who breathed. And he set fire to Hazor. 12Joshua captured all the cities of these kings, and all their kings, and he struck them with the edge of the sword, utterly destroying them, just as Moses the servant of the LORD had commanded. 13But Israel did not burn any of the cities that stood [walled and fortified] on their mounds, except Hazor alone, which Joshua burned. 14The sons of Israel took as their plunder all the spoil of these cities and the cattle; but they struck every man with the edge of the sword, until they had destroyed them. They left no one alive. 15Just as the LORD had commanded Moses His servant, so Moses had commanded Joshua, and so Joshua did; he left nothing undone of all that the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n16So Joshua took all this land: the hill country, all the Negev (South country), all the land of Goshen, the lowland, the Arabah [plain], the hill country of Israel and its lowland 17from Mount Halak, that rises toward Seir [in the south], even as far as Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon at the foot of Mount Hermon [in the north]. He captured all their kings and struck them and put them to death. 18Joshua waged war with all these kings a long time [at least five years]. 19There was no city that made peace with the Israelites except the Hivites living in Gibeon; they took all the others in battle. 20For it was [the purpose] of the LORD to harden their hearts, to meet Israel in battle so that Israel would utterly destroy them, that they would receive no mercy, but that Israel would destroy them, just as the LORD had commanded Moses.\n\n21Then Joshua came at that time and cut off the Anakim from the hill country, from Hebron, from Debir, from Anab and from all the hill country of Judah and all the hill country of Israel. Joshua utterly destroyed them with their cities. 22There were no Anakim left in the land of the children of Israel; only in Gaza, in Gath, and in Ashdod [of Philistia] some remained. 23So Joshua took the whole land [of Canaan], according to all that the LORD had spoken to Moses, and Joshua gave it as an inheritance to Israel according to their divisions by their tribes. So the land had rest from war.\n\nJoshua 12\nKings Defeated By Israel\n\n1Now these are the kings of the land whom the sons of Israel defeated, and whose land they possessed beyond the Jordan toward the east, from the valley of the [river] Arnon to Mount Hermon, and all the Arabah [plain] to the east: 2Sihon king of the Amorites, who lived in Heshbon, and ruled from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, both the middle of the valley and half of Gilead, and as far as the brook Jabbok, [which is] the border of the sons of Ammon; 3and the Arabah [plain] as far as the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) eastward, and as far as the sea of the Arabah, the Salt (Dead) Sea, eastward toward Beth-jeshimoth, and southward to the foot of the slopes of [Mount] Pisgah; 4and the territory of Og king of Bashan, one of the remnant of the Rephaim, who lived at Ashtaroth and at Edrei, 5and ruled over Mount Hermon and Salecah and all of Bashan to the border of the Geshurites and the Maacathites, and over half of Gilead, as far as the border of Sihon king of Heshbon. 6Moses the servant of the LORD and the sons of Israel defeated them; and Moses the servant of the LORD gave their land as a possession to the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh.\n\n7These are the kings of the land whom Joshua and the sons of Israel defeated on the west side of the Jordan, from Baal-gad in the Valley of Lebanon to Mount Halak, which rises toward Seir. Joshua gave their land to the tribes of Israel as a possession according to their divisions, 8in the hill country, in the lowland (foothills), in the Arabah [plain], on the slopes [descending to the Dead Sea], and in the wilderness, and in the Negev (South country)—the [lands of the] Hittite, the Amorite and the Canaanite, the Perizzite, the Hivite and the Jebusite: 9the king of Jericho, one; the king of Ai, which is beside Bethel, one; 10the king of Jerusalem, one; the king of Hebron, one; 11the king of Jarmuth, one; the king of Lachish, one; 12the king of Eglon, one; the king of Gezer, one; 13the king of Debir, one; the king of Geder, one; 14the king of Hormah, one; the king of Arad, one; 15the king of Libnah, one; the king of Adullam, one; 16the king of Makkedah, one; the king of Bethel, one; 17the king of Tappuah, one; the king of Hepher, one; 18the king of Aphek, one; the king of Lasharon, one; 19the king of Madon, one; the king of Hazor, one; 20the king of Shimron-meron, one; the king of Achshaph, one; 21the king of Taanach, one; the king of Megiddo, one; 22the king of Kedesh, one; the king of Jokneam in Carmel, one; 23the king of Dor in the heights of Dor, one; the king of Goiim in Gilgal, one; 24the king of Tirzah, one: in all, thirty-one kings.\n\nJoshua 13\nCanaan Divided Among The Tribes\n\n1Now Joshua was old and advanced in years, and the LORD said to him, “You have grown old and advanced in years, and very substantial portions of the land remain to be possessed. 2This is the land that remains: all the regions of the Philistines and all those of the Geshurites; 3from the Shihor [waterway] which is east of Egypt [at the southern end of Canaan], northward to the border of Ekron (all of it regarded as Canaanite); the five rulers of the Philistines: the Gazite, Ashdodite, the Ashkelonite, the Gittite, the Ekronite; and the Avvite 4in the south, all the land of the Canaanite, and Mearah that belongs to the Sidonians, as far as Aphek, to the border of the Amorite; 5and the land of the Gebalite, and all Lebanon, toward the east, from Baal-gad below Mount Hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 6As for all the inhabitants of the hill country from Lebanon to Misrephoth-maim, even all the Sidonians, I will drive them out before Israel; only allot the land to Israel as an inheritance just as I have commanded you. 7“So now, divide this land [west of the Jordan] as an inheritance for the nine tribes and the half-tribe of Manasseh.”\n\n8With the other half-tribe [of Manasseh], the Reubenites and the Gadites received their inheritance which Moses gave them beyond the Jordan eastward, just as Moses the servant of the LORD gave to them; 9from Aroer on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city in the middle of the valley, and all the plain of Medeba, as far as Dibon; 10and all the cities of Sihon king of the Amorites, who reigned in Heshbon, as far as the border of the Ammonites; 11and Gilead, and the territory of the Geshurites and Maacathites, and all Mount Hermon, and all Bashan as far as Salecah; 12the entire kingdom of Og in Bashan, who reigned in Ashtaroth and Edrei—he alone was left of the remnant of the Rephaim [giants]—for Moses had struck them and dispossessed them. 13But the sons of Israel did not dispossess the Geshurites or the Maacathites; for Geshur and Maacath live among Israel to this day. 14It was only to the tribe of Levi that Moses gave no [territory as an] inheritance; the offerings by fire to the LORD, the God of Israel, are their inheritance, as He told him.\n\n15So Moses gave an inheritance to the tribe of the sons of Reuben according to their families. 16Their territory was from Aroer, which is on the edge of the valley of the [river] Arnon, and the city which is in the middle of the valley and all the plain by Medeba; 17with Heshbon, and all its cities which are on the plain: Dibon and Bamoth-baal and Beth-baal-meon, 18and Jahaz and Kedemoth and Mephaath, 19and Kiriathaim and Sibmah and Zereth-shahar on the hill of the valley, 20and Beth-peor and the slopes of Pisgah and Beth-jeshimoth, 21even all the cities of the plain and all the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites who reigned in Heshbon, whom Moses struck down along with the leaders of Midian, Evi and Rekem and Zur and Hur and Reba, the princes of Sihon, who lived in the land. 22The sons of Israel also killed Balaam the son of Beor, the diviner (soothsayer), with the sword among [the rest of] their slain. 23The border of the sons of Reuben was the Jordan. This was the inheritance of the sons of Reuben according to their families, with their cities and villages.\n\n24Moses also gave an inheritance to the tribe of Gad, to the sons of Gad, according to their families. 25Their territory was Jazer, and all the cities of Gilead, and half the land of the sons of Ammon, as far as Aroer east of Rabbah; 26and from Heshbon as far as Ramath-mizpeh and Betonim, and from Mahanaim as far as the border of Debir; 27and in the valley, Beth-haram and Beth-nimrah and Succoth and Zaphon, the rest of the kingdom of Sihon king of Heshbon, with the Jordan as a border, as far as the lower end of the Sea of Chinnereth (Galilee) east of the Jordan. 28This is the inheritance of the sons of Gad according to their families, with their cities and their villages.\n\n29Moses also gave an inheritance to the half-tribe of Manasseh; and it was for the half-tribe of the sons of Manasseh according to their families. 30Their region extended from Mahanaim, all Bashan, the entire kingdom of Og king of Bashan, and all the towns of Jair, which are in Bashan, sixty cities; 31also half of Gilead, with Ashtaroth and Edrei, the cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan; these were for the sons of Machir the son of Manasseh, for half of the sons of Machir according to their families (clans).\n\n32These are the territories which Moses distributed as an inheritance in the plains of Moab, beyond the Jordan at Jericho to the east. 33But to the tribe of Levi, Moses did not give an inheritance; the LORD, the God of Israel, is their inheritance, as He told them.\n\nJoshua 14\nCaleb’s Request\n\n1Now these are the territories which the tribes of Israel inherited in the land of Canaan, which Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of Israel apportioned to them as an inheritance, 2by the lot of their inheritance, as the LORD had commanded through Moses, for the nine tribes and the half-tribe. 3For Moses had given an inheritance to the two tribes and the half-tribe beyond the Jordan; but he did not give [any territory as] an inheritance to the Levites among them. 4For the sons of Joseph were two tribes, Manasseh and Ephraim, and no portion was given in the land to the Levites except cities in which to live, with their pasture lands for their livestock and for their property. 5The Israelites did just as the LORD had commanded Moses, and they divided the land.\n\n6Then the [tribe of the] sons of Judah approached Joshua in Gilgal, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite said to him, “You know the word which the LORD said to Moses the man of God concerning me and you in Kadesh-barnea. 7I was forty years old when Moses the servant of the LORD sent me from Kadesh-barnea to scout the land [of Canaan], and I brought a report back to him as it was in my heart. 8My brothers (fellow spies) who went up with me made the heart of the people melt with fear; but I followed the LORD my God completely. 9So Moses swore [an oath to me] on that day, saying, ‘Be assured that the land on which your foot has walked will be an inheritance to you and to your children always, because you have followed the LORD my God completely.’ 10And now, look, the LORD has let me live, just as He said, these forty-five years since the LORD spoke this word to Moses, when Israel wandered in the wilderness; and now, look at me, I am eighty-five years old today. 11I am still as strong today as I was the day Moses sent me; as my strength was then, so is my strength now, for war and for going out and coming in. 12“So now, give me this hill country about which the LORD spoke that day, for you heard on that day that the [giant-like] Anakim were there, with great fortified cities; perhaps the LORD will be with me, and I shall drive them out just as the LORD said.”\n\n13So Joshua blessed him and gave Hebron to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as an inheritance. 14Therefore, Hebron became the inheritance of Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenizzite to this day, because he followed the LORD, the God of Israel, completely. 15The name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba [city of Arba]; for Arba was the greatest man among the [giant-like] Anakim. Then the land had rest from war.\n\nJoshua 15\nTerritory Of Judah\n\n1Now the lot (allotment) for the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families reached [southward to] the border of Edom, southward to the wilderness of Zin at its most southern part. 2Their southern border was from the lower end of the Salt (Dead) Sea, from the bay that turns southward. 3Then it proceeded southward to the ascent of Akrabbim and continued along to Zin, and then went by the south of Kadesh-barnea and continued along to Hezron, and went up to Addar and turned about to Karka. 4It continued along to Azmon and proceeded to the Brook of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish), and the border ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. This was their southern border. 5The eastern border was the Salt (Dead) Sea, as far as the mouth of the Jordan. The northern border was from the bay of the sea at the mouth of the Jordan. 6Then the border went up to Beth-hoglah, and continued along north of Beth-arabah, and the border went up to the [landmark of the] stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 7The border went up to Debir from the Valley of Achor, and turned northward toward Gilgal which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, which is on the south side of the valley; and the border continued on to the waters of En-shemesh and ended at En-rogel. 8Then the border went up by the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom) at the southern slope of the Jebusite [city] (that is, Jerusalem); and the border went up to the top of the mountain that lies before the Valley of Hinnom to the west, which is at the northern end of the Valley of Rephaim. 9Then the border extended from the top of the mountain to the spring of the waters of Nephtoah and proceeded to the cities of Mount Ephron; then the border curved to Baalah (that is, Kiriath-jearim). 10The border went around west from Baalah to Mount Seir, and passed along to the northern slope of Mount Jearim (that is, Chesalon), and went down to Beth-shemesh and then continued on through Timnah. 11The border proceeded to the slope [of the hill] of Ekron northward, then curved to Shikkeron and continued to Mount Baalah and proceeded to Jabneel. Then the border ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. 12The western border was at the Great Sea, with its coastline. This is the border around the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families.\n\n13Now to Caleb the son of Jephunneh Joshua gave a portion among the sons of Judah, as the LORD commanded him, namely, Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron). 14So Caleb drove out from there the three sons of Anak: Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai, the children of Anak. 15Then he went up from there against the people of Debir; Debir was formerly named Kiriath-sepher. 16Caleb said, “I will give Achsah my daughter as wife to the man who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it.” 17And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s brother, captured it; so he gave him Achsah his daughter as a wife. 18Now it came about that when Achsah came to Othniel, she persuaded him [to allow her] to ask her father for a field. Then she [rode up to Caleb and] dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?” 19Achsah answered, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the [dry] land of the Negev (South country), give me springs of water, too.” So he gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.\n\n20This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Judah according to their families (clans).\n\n21The cities of the tribe of the sons of Judah in the extreme south toward the border of Edom were Kabzeel and Eder and Jagur, 22and Kinah and Dimonah and Adadah, 23and Kedesh and Hazor and Ithnan, 24Ziph and Telem and Bealoth, 25and Hazor-hadattah and Kerioth-hezron (that is, Hazor), 26Amam and Shema and Moladah, 27and Hazar-gaddah and Heshmon and Beth-pelet, 28and Hazar-shual and Beersheba and Biziothiah, 29Baalah and Iim and Ezem, 30and Eltolad and Chesil and Hormah, 31and Ziklag and Madmannah and Sansannah, 32and Lebaoth and Shilhim and Ain and Rimmon; in all twenty-nine cities with their villages.\n\n33In the lowland: Eshtaol and Zorah and Ashnah, 34and Zanoah and En-gannim, Tappuah and Enam, 35Jarmuth and Adullam, Socoh and Azekah, 36and Shaaraim and Adithaim and Gederah and Gederothaim; fourteen cities with their villages.\n\n37Zenan and Hadashah and Migdal-gad, 38and Dilean and Mizpeh and Joktheel, 39Lachish and Bozkath and Eglon, 40and Cabbon and Lahmas and Chitlish, 41and Gederoth, Beth-dagon and Naamah and Makkedah; sixteen cities with their villages.\n\n42Libnah and Ether and Ashan, 43and Iphtah and Ashnah and Nezib, 44and Keilah and Achzib and Mareshah; nine cities with their villages.\n\n45Ekron, with its towns and villages; 46from Ekron even to the sea, all that were beside Ashdod, with their villages;\n\n47Ashdod, with its towns and its villages; Gaza, with its towns and its villages; as far as the Brook of Egypt (Wadi el-Arish) and the Great [Mediterranean] Sea with its coastline.\n\n48In the hill country: Shamir and Jattir and Socoh, 49and Dannah and Kiriath-sannah (that is, Debir), 50and Anab and Eshtemoh and Anim, 51and Goshen and Holon and Giloh; eleven cities with their villages.\n\n52Arab and Dumah and Eshan, 53and Janum and Beth-tappuah and Aphekah, 54and Humtah and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron), and Zior; nine cities with their villages.\n\n55Maon, Carmel and Ziph and Juttah, 56and Jezreel and Jokdeam and Zanoah, 57Kain, Gibeah and Timnah; ten cities with their villages.\n\n58Halhul, Beth-zur and Gedor, 59and Maarath and Beth-anoth and Eltekon; six cities with their villages.\n\n60Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), and Rabbah; two cities with their villages.\n\n61In the wilderness [that slopes downward toward the Dead Sea]: Beth-arabah, Middin and Secacah, 62and Nibshan and the City of Salt and Engedi; six cities with their villages.\n\n63But as for the Jebusites, the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the [tribe of the] sons of Judah were not able to drive them out; so the Jebusites live with the sons of Judah in Jerusalem to this day.\n\nJoshua 16\nTerritory Of Ephraim\n\n1Then the lot (allotment) for the sons of Joseph went from the Jordan Valley at Jericho to the waters of Jericho on the east into the wilderness, going up from Jericho through the hill country to Bethel. 2Then it went from Bethel to Luz, and continued to Ataroth, the border of the Archites. 3It went down westward to the territory of the Japhletites, as far as the outskirts of lower Beth-horon, then to Gezer, and it ended at the sea.\n\n4The sons of Joseph, Manasseh and Ephraim, received their inheritance. 5Now this was the territory of the sons of Ephraim according to their families: on the east side the border of their inheritance was Ataroth-addar, as far as upper Beth-horon. 6Then the border went westward at Michmethath on the north, and turned eastward to Taanath-shiloh and continued beyond it to the east of Janoah. 7It went down from Janoah to Ataroth and to Naarah, touched Jericho and ended at the Jordan. 8The border continued from Tappuah westward to the Brook Kanah, and it ended at the [Mediterranean] sea. This is the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Ephraim according to their families (clans), 9with the cities which were set apart for the sons of Ephraim within the inheritance of the sons of Manasseh, all the cities with their villages. 10But they did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites live among Ephraim to this day, and they became forced laborers.\n\nJoshua 17\nTerritory Of Manasseh\n\n1Now this was the lot (allotment) for the tribe of Manasseh, for he was the firstborn of Joseph. To Machir the firstborn of Manasseh, the father of Gilead, were allotted Gilead and Bashan, because he was a man of war. 2So the lot was also made for the rest of the sons of Manasseh according to their families—for the sons of Abiezer and for the sons of Helek and for the sons of Asriel and for the sons of Shechem and for the sons of Hepher and for the sons of Shemida; these were the male descendants of Manasseh the son of Joseph according to their families (clans).\n\n3But Zelophehad the son of Hepher, the son of Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, had no sons, only daughters; and these are the names of his daughters: Mahlah and Noah, Hoglah, Milcah and Tirzah. 4They came before Eleazar the priest and before Joshua the son of Nun and before the leaders and said, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us an inheritance among our brothers.” So according to the command of the LORD Joshua gave them an inheritance among their father’s brothers. 5So ten portions fell to Manasseh, besides the land of Gilead and Bashan, which is beyond the Jordan [on the east side of the river], 6because the daughters of [Zelophehad, a descendant of] Manasseh had received an inheritance among his [other] sons [whose inheritance went to their male descendants]. The land of Gilead belonged to the rest of the sons of Manasseh.\n\n7The territory of Manasseh reached from Asher to Michmethath which was east of Shechem; then the border went southward to the inhabitants of En-tappuah. 8The land of Tappuah belonged to Manasseh, but [the city of] Tappuah on the border of Manasseh belonged to the sons of Ephraim. 9Then the border went down to the brook of Kanah, south of the brook (these cities belonged to Ephraim, among the cities of Manasseh), and Manasseh’s border was on the north side of the brook and it ended at the sea. 10The land on the south side belonged to Ephraim and that on the north side was Manasseh’s, and the sea was their border; they reached to [the territory of] Asher on the north and to [the territory of] Issachar on the east. 11Also, in Issachar and in Asher, Manasseh had Beth-shean and its towns and Ibleam and its towns, and the inhabitants of Dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of En-dor and its towns, and the inhabitants of Taanach and its towns, and the inhabitants of Megiddo and its towns; the third is Napheth. 12But the sons of Manasseh were not able to [drive out the inhabitants and] take possession of these cities, because the Canaanites persisted in living in that land. 13When the Israelites became strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.\n\n14The sons of Joseph spoke to Joshua, saying, “Why have you given us only one lot and one portion as an inheritance, when we are a numerous people whom the LORD has so far blessed?” 15Then Joshua replied, “If you are a numerous people, go up to the forest and clear ground for yourselves there in the land of the Perizzites and the Rephaim, since the hill country of Ephraim is too narrow for you.” 16The sons of Joseph said, “The hill country is not enough for us, and all the Canaanites who live in the valley have iron chariots, both those who are in Beth-shean and its towns and those in the Valley of Jezreel.” 17Joshua said to the house of Joseph, to Ephraim and to Manasseh, “You are a numerous people and have great power; you shall not have only one lot, 18but the hill country shall be yours. For though it is a forest, you shall clear it and possess it to its farthest borders; for you shall drive out the Canaanites, even though they have iron chariots and though they are strong.”\n\nJoshua 18\nRest Of The Land Divided\n\n1Then the whole congregation of the Israelites assembled at Shiloh [in the tribal territory of Ephraim], and set up the Tent of Meeting there; and the land was subdued before them.\n\n2There remained among the Israelites seven tribes who had not yet divided their inheritance. 3So Joshua asked them, “How long will you put off entering to take possession of the land which the LORD, the God of your fathers, has given you? 4Provide for yourselves three men from each tribe so that I may send them, and that they may go through the land and write a description of it with regard to their [tribal] inheritance; then they shall return to me. 5They shall divide it into seven parts; [the tribe of] Judah shall remain in its territory on the south, and the house of Joseph shall remain in its territory on the north. 6You shall describe the land in seven divisions, and bring the description here to me. I will cast lots for you here before the LORD our God. 7“But the Levites have no portion among you, because the priesthood of the LORD is their inheritance. Gad and Reuben and half the tribe of Manasseh also have received their inheritance eastward beyond the Jordan, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave them.”\n\n8So the men arose and went [on their way], and Joshua commanded those who went to describe the land, saying, “Go and walk throughout the land and describe it, and return to me; and I will cast lots for you here before the LORD in Shiloh.” 9So the men set out and passed through the land, and described it by cities in seven divisions in a book; and they came back to Joshua to the camp at Shiloh. 10Joshua cast lots for them in Shiloh before the LORD, and there Joshua divided the land to the sons of Israel, [to each tribe] according to their portions.\n\nThe Territory of Benjamin 11Now the lot (allotment) of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin came up according to their families, and the territory of their lot fell between [the tribes of] the sons of Judah and the sons of Joseph. 12On the north side their border began at the Jordan, then it went up the slope of Jericho on the north, and up through the hill country westward, and it ended at the Beth-aven wilderness. 13Then the border continued southward toward Luz, to the slope of Luz (that is, Bethel); then the border went down to Ataroth-addar, by the hill that lies south of lower Beth-horon. 14The border changed course [from there] and turned around on the western side southward, from the hill that lies to the south opposite Beth-horon; it ended at Kiriath-baal (that is, Kiriath-jearim), a city of [the tribe of] the sons of Judah. This formed the western side [of Benjamin’s territory]. 15The southern side was from the edge of Kiriath-jearim, and the border went on westward and went to the source of the waters of Nephtoah. 16Then the border went down to the edge of the hill overlooking the Valley of Ben-hinnom (son of Hinnom), which is at the north end of the Valley of Rephaim; and it descended to the Valley of Hinnom, south to the slope of the Jebusite, and went on down to En-rogel. 17Then it turned toward the north and went on to En-shemesh and on to Geliloth, which is opposite the ascent of Adummim, and it went down to the stone of Bohan the son of Reuben. 18It continued to the north to the side opposite [Beth-] Arabah and went down to the Arabah. 19The border continued along to the north of the slope of Beth-hoglah; and the border ended at the northern bay of the Salt (Dead) Sea, at the south end of the Jordan. This was the southern border. 20And the Jordan River was its border on the east side. This was the inheritance of the sons of Benjamin, according to their families and according to its borders all around.\n\n21Now the cities of the tribe of the sons of Benjamin according to their families were Jericho and Beth-hoglah and Emek-keziz, 22and Beth-arabah and Zemaraim and Bethel, 23and Avvim and Parah and Ophrah, 24and Chephar-ammoni and Ophni and Geba; twelve cities with their villages; 25Gibeon and Ramah and Beeroth, 26and Mizpeh and Chephirah and Mozah, 27and Rekem and Irpeel and Taralah, 28and Zelah, Haeleph and the Jebusite (that is, Jerusalem), Gibeah, Kiriath; fourteen cities with their villages. This is the inheritance of [the tribe of] the sons of Benjamin according to their families (clans).\n\nJoshua 19\nTerritory Of Simeon\n\n1Then the second lot fell to Simeon, to the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families (clans), and their inheritance was within the inheritance of the sons of Judah. 2So they had as their inheritance Beersheba or Sheba and Moladah, 3and Hazar-shual and Balah and Ezem, 4and Eltolad and Bethul and Hormah, 5and Ziklag and Beth-marcaboth and Hazar-susah, 6and Beth-lebaoth and Sharuhen; thirteen cities with their villages; 7Ain, Rimmon and Ether and Ashan; four cities with their villages; 8and all the villages which were around these cities as far as Baalath-beer, Ramah of the Negev (South country). This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Simeon according to their families. 9The inheritance of the sons of Simeon was taken from the portion of the sons of Judah, for the share of the sons of Judah was too large for them; so the sons of Simeon received an inheritance within Judah’s inheritance.\n\nTerritory of Zebulun 10The third lot came up for [the tribe of] the sons of Zebulun according to their families. The territory of their inheritance extended to Sarid. 11Then its border went up westward and on to Maralah, and reached to Dabbesheth and reached to the brook east of Jokneam. 12Then it turned from Sarid east toward the sunrise as far as the border of Chisloth-tabor, and it proceeded to Daberath and on up to Japhia. 13From there it continued east toward the sunrise to Gath-hepher and to Eth-kazin, and proceeded to Rimmon which turns toward Neah. 14The border circled it on the north to Hannathon, ending at the Valley of Iphtahel. 15Included were Kattah and Nahalal and Shimron and Idalah and Bethlehem; twelve cities with their villages. 16This was the inheritance of the sons of Zebulun according to their families, these cities with their villages.\n\nTerritory of Issachar 17The fourth lot fell to [the tribe of] Issachar, to the sons of Issachar according to their families. 18Their territory included: Jezreel and Chesulloth and Shunem, 19and Hapharaim and Shion and Anaharath, 20and Rabbith and Kishion and Ebez, 21and Remeth and En-gannim and En-haddah and Beth-pazzez. 22The border reached to Tabor and Shahazumah and Beth-shemesh, and their border ended at the Jordan; sixteen cities with their villages. 23This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Issachar according to their families, the cities and their villages.\n\nTerritory of Asher 24The fifth lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families. 25Their territory was Helkath and Hali and Beten and Achshaph, 26and Allammelech and Amad and Mishal; and on the west it reached to Carmel and to Shihor-libnath. 27Then it turned eastward to Beth-dagon and reached Zebulun and the Valley of Iphtahel northward to Beth-emek and Neiel, and continued in the north to Cabul, 28and Ebron and Rehob and Hammon and Kanah, as far as Great Sidon. 29Then the border turned to Ramah, [reaching] to the fortified city of Tyre; and it turned to Hosah, and it ended at the [Mediterranean] sea at the region of Achzib. 30Included were Ummah, and Aphek and Rehob; twenty-two cities with their villages. 31This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Asher according to their families, these cities with their villages.\n\nTerritory of Naphtali 32The sixth lot fell to [the tribe of] the sons of Naphtali according to their families. 33Their border ran from Heleph, from the oak in Zaanannim and Adami-nekeb and Jabneel, as far as Lakkum, and it ended at the Jordan. 34Then the border turned westward to Aznoth-tabor and went from there to Hukkok; and it reached Zebulun on the south and reached Asher on the west, and to Judah toward the east at the Jordan. 35The fortified cities were Ziddim, Zer, and Hammath, Rakkath and Chinnereth, 36and Adamah and Ramah and Hazor, 37and Kedesh and Edrei and En-hazor, 38and Yiron and Migdal-el, Horem and Beth-anath and Beth-shemesh; nineteen cities with their villages. 39This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Naphtali according to their families, the cities and their villages.\n\nTerritory of Dan 40The seventh lot fell to the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families. 41The territory of their inheritance included Zorah and Eshtaol and Ir-shemesh, 42and Shaalabbin and Aijalon and Ithlah, 43and Elon and Timnah and Ekron, 44and Eltekeh and Gibbethon and Baalath, 45and Jehud and Bene-berak and Gath-rimmon, 46and Me-jarkon and Rakkon, with the territory opposite Joppa. 47The territory of the sons of Dan went beyond these; so the sons of Dan went up to fight against Leshem (Laish) and captured it. Then they struck it with the edge of the sword and took possession of it and settled there [between the tribes of Naphtali and Manasseh]; they renamed Leshem, Dan, after the name of their father (ancestor) Dan. 48This was the inheritance of the tribe of the sons of Dan according to their families (clans), these cities with their villages.\n\n49When they had finished dividing the land for inheritance by its borders, the Israelites gave an inheritance among them to Joshua the son of Nun. 50According to the command of the LORD they gave him the city for which he asked—Timnath-serah in the hill country of Ephraim. So he built the city and settled in it.\n\n51These are the inheritances which Eleazar the priest, Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel distributed by lot in Shiloh before the LORD at the doorway of the Tent of Meeting. So they finished dividing the land.\n\nJoshua 20\nSix Cities Of Refuge\n\n1The LORD spoke to Joshua, saying, 2“Speak to the Israelites, saying, ‘Designate the cities of refuge (asylum), of which I spoke to you through Moses, 3so that the person (manslayer) who kills any person unintentionally, without premeditation, may flee there, and they shall be your refuge from the blood avenger. 4‘He shall flee to one of these cities, and shall stand at the entrance of the gate of the city and explain his case to the elders of that city; and they shall take him into [the protection of] the city and give him a place [to stay], so that he may live among them. 5‘If the blood avenger pursues him, they shall not hand the offender (manslayer) over to him, because he killed his neighbor unintentionally and without premeditation and did not hate him beforehand. 6‘He shall live in that city until he has stood before the congregation for judgment [and if acquitted of murder he must stay there], until the death of the one who is the high priest in those days. Then the offender (manslayer) shall return to his own city and his own house from which he fled.’”\n\n7So they set apart and consecrated Kedesh in Galilee in the hill country of Naphtali, and Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim, and Kiriath-arba (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah. 8Beyond the Jordan east of Jericho, they designated Bezer in the wilderness on the plain from the tribe of Reuben, and Ramoth in Gilead from the tribe of Gad, and Golan in Bashan from the tribe of Manasseh. 9These were the appointed cities for all the Israelites and for the stranger sojourning (living temporarily) among them, so that whoever killed any person unintentionally may flee there, and not die by the hand of the blood avenger until he had stood before the congregation [for judgment].\n\nJoshua 21\nForty-Eight Cities Of The Levites\n\n1Then the heads of the households of the Levites came to Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun, and the heads of the households of the tribes of the sons of Israel. 2They spoke to them at Shiloh in the land of Canaan, saying, “The LORD commanded Moses to give us cities to live in, with their pasture lands for our cattle.” 3So the sons of Israel gave the Levites from their inheritance these [forty-eight] cities and their pasture lands, in accordance with the command of the LORD. 4The [first] lot (allotment) came out for the families of the Kohathites. So those Levites who were sons (descendants) of Aaron the priest received thirteen cities by lot from the tribe of Judah and from the tribe of Simeon and from the tribe of Benjamin.\n\n5The rest of the sons of Kohath received ten cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Ephraim and from the tribe of Dan and from the half-tribe of Manasseh.\n\n6The sons of Gershon received thirteen cities by lot from the families of the tribe of Issachar and from the tribe of Asher and from the tribe of Naphtali and from the half-tribe of Manasseh in Bashan.\n\n7The sons of Merari according to their families received twelve cities from the tribe of Reuben and from the tribe of Gad and from the tribe of Zebulun.\n\n8The sons of Israel gave by lot to the Levites these cities with their pasture lands, as the LORD had commanded through Moses.\n\n9They gave these cities which are mentioned here by name from the tribe of the sons of Judah and from the tribe of the sons of Simeon; 10and they were for the sons of Aaron, one of the families of the Kohathites, of the sons of Levi, because the lot fell to them first. 11They gave them [the city of] Kiriath-arba, Arba being the father of Anak (that is, Hebron) in the hill country of Judah, with its surrounding pasture lands. 12But the fields of the city and its villages they had given to Caleb the son of Jephunneh as his property.\n\n13So to the sons of Aaron the priest they gave Hebron, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands, and Libnah with its pasture lands, 14and Jattir with its pasture lands and Eshtemoa with its pasture lands, 15and Holon with its pasture lands and Debir with its pasture lands, 16and Ain with its pasture lands and Juttah with its pasture lands and Beth-shemesh with its pasture lands; nine cities from these two tribes (Judah and Simeon). 17From the tribe of Benjamin, Gibeon with its pasture lands, and Geba with its pasture lands, 18Anathoth with its pasture lands and Almon with its pasture lands; four cities. 19All the cities of the sons of Aaron, the priests, were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.\n\n20Then the cities from the tribe of Ephraim were allotted to the families of the sons of Kohath, the Levites, even to the rest of the sons of Kohath. 21They gave them Shechem, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands, in the hill country of Ephraim, and Gezer with its pasture lands, 22and Kibzaim with its pasture lands and Beth-horon with its pasture lands; four cities. 23From the tribe of Dan, Eltekeh with its pasture lands, Gibbethon with its pasture lands, 24Aijalon with its pasture lands, Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; four cities. 25From the half-tribe of Manasseh, they allotted Taanach with its pasture lands and Gath-rimmon with its pasture lands; two cities. 26All the cities with their pasture lands for the families of the rest of the sons of Kohath totaled ten.\n\n27To the sons of Gershon, one of the families of the Levites, they gave from the other half-tribe of Manasseh, [the city of] Golan in Bashan, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands, and Be-eshterah with its pasture lands; two cities. 28From the tribe of Issachar, they gave Kishion with its pasture lands, Daberath with its pasture lands, 29Jarmuth with its pasture lands, and En-gannim with its pasture lands; four cities. 30From the tribe of Asher, they gave Mishal with its pasture lands, Abdon with its pasture lands, 31Helkath with its pasture lands and Rehob with its pasture lands; four cities. 32From the tribe of Naphtali, they gave Kedesh in Galilee, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands and Hammoth-dor with its pasture lands and Kartan with its pasture lands; three cities. 33All the cities of the Gershonites according to their families were thirteen cities with their pasture lands.\n\n34To the families of the sons of Merari, the rest of the Levites, they gave from the tribe of Zebulun, Jokneam with its pasture lands and Kartah with its pasture lands, 35Dimnah with its pasture lands and Nahalal with its pasture lands; four cities. 36From the tribe of Reuben, they gave Bezer with its pasture lands and Jahaz with its pasture lands, 37Kedemoth with its pasture lands and Mephaath with its pasture lands; four cities. 38From the tribe of Gad, they gave Ramoth in Gilead, the city of refuge for anyone who committed manslaughter, with its pasture lands and Mahanaim with its pasture lands, 39Heshbon with its pasture lands and Jazer with its pasture lands; four cities in all. 40All [these were] the cities of the sons of Merari according to their families, the rest of the families of the Levites; and their lot was twelve cities.\n\n41All the cities of the Levites in the midst of the property of the sons of Israel were forty-eight cities with their pasture lands. 42These cities each had its surrounding pasture lands; so it was with all these cities.\n\n43So the LORD gave Israel all the land which He had sworn to give to their fathers (ancestors), and they took possession of it and lived in it. 44The LORD gave them rest [from conflict] on every side, in accordance with everything that He had sworn to their fathers, and not one of all their enemies stood before them [in battle]; the LORD handed over all their enemies to them. 45Not one of the good promises which the LORD had spoken to the house of Israel failed; all had come to pass.\n\nJoshua 22\nTribes Beyond Jordan Return\n\n1Then Joshua called the Reubenites and the Gadites and the half-tribe of Manasseh, 2and said to them, “You have kept all that Moses the servant of the LORD commanded you, and have listened to and obeyed my voice in everything that I commanded you. 3You have not deserted your brothers these many days to this day, but have [carefully] kept the obligation of the commandment of the LORD your God. 4And now the LORD your God has given rest to your brothers, as He has promised them; so turn now and go to your tents, to the land of your possession, which Moses the servant of the LORD gave you beyond the [east side of the] Jordan. 5“Only be very careful and diligently observe the commandment and the law which Moses the servant of the LORD has commanded you to love the LORD your God and walk in all His ways and keep His commandments and hold fast to Him and serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul [your very life].” 6So Joshua blessed them and sent them away, and they went to their tents.\n\n7Now to the one-half of the tribe of Manasseh Moses had given a possession in Bashan, but to the other half Joshua gave a possession on the west side of the Jordan among their brothers. So when Joshua sent them away to their tents, he blessed them, 8and he said to them, “Return to your tents with great riches and with very much livestock, with silver, gold, bronze, iron, and with very many clothes; divide the spoil of your enemies with your brothers (fellow tribesmen).” 9So the sons (descendants) of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh returned home and departed from the [other] sons (western tribes) of Israel at Shiloh which is in the land of Canaan, to go to the land of Gilead, to the land of their own which they had possessed, in accordance with the command of the LORD through Moses.\n\nThe Offensive Altar 10When they came to the region of the Jordan which is in the land of Canaan, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh built an altar there by the Jordan, an altar that was great to behold. 11And the [other] sons of Israel heard it said, “Look, the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh have built an altar at the edge of the land of Canaan, in the region [west] of the Jordan, on the side belonging to the sons of Israel.” 12When the sons of Israel heard of it, the whole congregation of the Israelites gathered at Shiloh to make war against them.\n\n13Then the sons of Israel sent Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, 14and with him ten leaders, one leader from each father’s household from each of the tribes of Israel; and each one was the head of his father’s household among the thousands of Israel. 15They came to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh, in the land of Gilead, and they said to them, 16“This is what the entire congregation of the LORD says, ‘What is this disloyal and unfaithful act which you have committed against the God of Israel, so as to turn away from following the LORD this day, by building yourselves an altar, to rebel against the LORD this day? 17‘Is the wrongdoing (idolatry) of Peor not enough for us, from which we have not cleansed ourselves to this day, even though the affliction [in which twenty-four thousand died] came on the congregation of the LORD, 18that you would turn away this day from following the LORD? If you rebel against the LORD today, He will be angry with the entire congregation of Israel tomorrow. 19‘If, however, the land of your possession is unclean, then cross into the land of the possession of the LORD, where the LORD’S tabernacle is situated, and settle down among us. But do not rebel against the LORD, or rebel against us by building an altar for yourselves, besides the altar of the LORD our God [at Shiloh]. 20‘Did not Achan the son of Zerah act unfaithfully in the things under the ban, and [as a result God’s] wrath came on the entire congregation of Israel? And that man did not perish alone in his wrongdoing.’”\n\n21Then the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the half-tribe of Manasseh answered and said to the heads of the families of Israel, 22“The Mighty One, God, the LORD, the Mighty One, God, the LORD! He knows, and may Israel itself know. If it was in rebellion, or if in an unfaithful act against the LORD, do not save us this day! 23If we have built an altar for ourselves to turn away from following the LORD, or if [we did so] to offer a burnt offering or grain offering on it, or if to offer sacrifices of peace offerings on it, may the LORD Himself require it [of us and hold us responsible]. 24But in truth we have done this out of concern, for a reason, saying, ‘In time to come your sons (descendants) may say to our sons, What claim do you have to the LORD, the God of Israel? 25“For the LORD has made the Jordan a border between us and you, you sons of Reuben and sons of Gad; you have no part in the LORD.” So your sons (descendants) may cause our sons to stop fearing the LORD.’\n\n26“So we said, ‘Let us prepare and build an altar, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice, 27but to be a witness between us and you and between the generations after us, that we are to perform the service of the LORD before Him with our burnt offerings, and with our sacrifices and with our peace offerings, so that your sons (descendants) will not say to our sons in time to come, “You have no part in the LORD.”’ 28“So we said, ‘If your descendants should say this to us or to our descendants in time to come, then we can reply, “See the copy of the altar of the LORD which our fathers made, not for burnt offering or for sacrifice, but rather it is a witness between us and you.”’ 29“Far be it from us that we should rebel against the LORD and turn away from following the LORD this day, by building an altar for burnt offering, for grain offering or for sacrifice, besides the altar of the LORD our God which is before His tabernacle [in Shiloh].”\n\n30So when Phinehas the priest and the leaders of the congregation and heads of the families of Israel who were with him, heard the words which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh spoke, it pleased them. 31Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest said to the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad and the sons of Manasseh, “Today we know that the LORD is among us, because you have not committed this unfaithful act against the LORD; indeed you have saved Israel from the hand of the LORD.”\n\n32Then Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest and the leaders returned from the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad, from the land of Gilead to the land of Canaan, to the sons of Israel, and brought back word to them. 33The report pleased the sons of Israel, and the sons of Israel blessed God; and they said no more about going to battle against them to destroy the land in which the sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad were living. 34The sons of Reuben and the sons of Gad called the altar Witness; “For it is a witness between us that the LORD is God.”\n\nJoshua 23\nJoshua’s Farewell Address\n\n1A long time after that, when the LORD had given Israel rest from all their enemies on every side, and Joshua had grown old and advanced in years, 2that Joshua called all Israel, their elders and their heads and their judges and their officers, and said to them, “I am old and advanced in years. 3And you have seen all that the LORD your God has done to all these nations for your sake; for the LORD your God is He who has been fighting for you. 4See, I have allotted to you these nations that remain as an inheritance for your tribes, with all the nations which I have cut off, from the Jordan [on the east] to the Great [Mediterranean] Sea toward the setting sun. 5The LORD your God will push them away from before you and drive them out of your sight and you will take possession of their land, just as the LORD your God promised you. 6Be steadfast and very determined to keep and to do everything that is written in the Book of the Law of Moses, so that you do not turn aside from it to the right or the left, 7so that you do not associate with these nations which remain among you, or mention the name of their gods, or make anyone swear [an oath by them], or serve them, or bow down to them. 8But you are to cling to the LORD your God, just as you have done to this day. 9For the LORD has driven out great and mighty nations from before you; and as for you, no man has been able to stand [in opposition] before you to this day. 10One of your men puts to flight a thousand, for the LORD your God is He who is fighting for you, just as He promised you. 11So be very careful and watchful of yourselves to love the LORD your God. 12For if you ever turn back and cling to the rest of these nations, these that are left among you, and intermarry with them, so that you associate with them and they with you, 13know and understand with certainty that the LORD your God will not continue to drive these nations out from before you; but they will be a snare and trap to you, and a whip on your sides and thorns in your eyes, until you perish from this good land which the LORD your God has given you.\n\n14“Now behold, today I am going the way of all the earth, and you know in all your hearts and in all your souls that not one word of all the good words which the LORD your God has promised concerning you has failed; all have been fulfilled for you, not one of them has failed. 15It shall come about that just as every good word which the LORD your God spoke and promised to you has been fulfilled for you, so the LORD will bring upon you every bad thing [about which He warned you], until He has destroyed and eliminated you from this good land which the LORD your God has given you. 16“When you transgress (violate) the covenant of the LORD your God, which He commanded you [to follow], and you go and serve other gods and bow down to them, then the anger of the LORD will be kindled against you, and you shall perish quickly from the good land which He has given you.”\n\nJoshua 24\nJoshua Reviews Israel’s History\n\n1Then Joshua gathered all the tribes of Israel to Shechem, and called for the elders of Israel and for their heads and for their judges and for their officers; they presented themselves before God. 2Joshua said to all the people, “This is what the LORD, the God of Israel, says, ‘Your fathers, including Terah, the father of Abraham and the father of Nahor, lived beyond the [Euphrates] River in ancient times; and they served other gods. 3‘Then I took your father Abraham from beyond the [Euphrates] River and led him through all the land of Canaan, and multiplied his descendants, and I gave him Isaac. 4‘To Isaac I gave Jacob and Esau, and to Esau I gave [the hill country of] Mount Seir to possess; but Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt. 5‘Then I sent Moses and Aaron, and I plagued Egypt by what I did in its midst; and afterward I brought you out. 6‘Then I brought your fathers out of Egypt, and you came to the sea; and the Egyptians pursued your fathers with chariots and horsemen to the Red Sea. 7‘When they cried out to the LORD [for help], He put darkness between you and the Egyptians, and brought the sea upon them and covered them; and your own eyes saw what I did in Egypt. And you lived in the wilderness a long time (forty years). 8‘Then I brought you into the land of the Amorites who lived on the other side of the Jordan, and they fought with you; and I gave them into your hand, and you took possession of their land and I destroyed them before you. 9‘Then Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab, arose and fought against Israel, and he sent and called Balaam the son of Beor to curse you. 10‘But I would not listen to Balaam. Therefore he had to bless you, so I saved you from Balak’s hand. 11‘You crossed the Jordan and came to Jericho; and the citizens of Jericho fought against you, as did the Amorite and the Perizzite and the Canaanite and the Hittite and the Girgashite, the Hivite and the Jebusite; and so I gave them into your hand. 12‘I sent the hornet [that is, the terror of you] before you, which drove the two kings of the Amorites out before you; but it was not by your sword or by your bow. 13‘I gave you a land for which you did not labor, and cities which you did not build, and you live in them; you eat from vineyards and olive groves which you did not plant.’\n\n14“Now, therefore, fear the LORD and serve Him in sincerity and in truth; remove the gods which your fathers served on the other side of the [Euphrates] River and in Egypt, and serve the LORD. 15“If it is unacceptable in your sight to serve the LORD, choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve: whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the River, or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live; but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”\n\n16The people answered, “Far be it from us to abandon (reject) the LORD to serve other gods; 17for the LORD our God is He who brought us and our fathers up out of the land of Egypt, from the house of bondage, and who did these great signs (miracles) in our sight and kept us safe all along the way that we went and among all the peoples among whom we passed. 18“The LORD drove all the peoples out from before us, even the Amorites who lived in the land. We also will serve the LORD, for He is our God.”\n\n19Then Joshua said to the people, “You will not be able to serve the LORD [if you serve any other gods], for He is a holy God; He is a jealous God [demanding what is rightfully and uniquely His]. He will not forgive your transgression [of His law] or your sins. 20“If you do abandon (reject) the LORD and serve foreign gods, then He will turn and do you harm and consume and destroy you after He has done you good.” 21The people said to Joshua, “No, but we will serve [only] the LORD.” 22Joshua then said to the people, “You are witnesses against yourselves that you have chosen for yourselves the LORD, to serve Him.” And they said, “We are witnesses.” 23“Now then, remove the foreign gods which are among you, and incline your hearts toward the LORD, the God of Israel.” 24The people said to Joshua, “We will serve the LORD our God and we will listen to and obey His voice.” 25So Joshua made a covenant with the people that day, and made for them a statute and an ordinance at Shechem. 26And Joshua wrote these words in the Book of the Law of God. Then he took a large stone and set it up there under the oak that was in [the courtyard of] the sanctuary of the LORD. 27Joshua then said to all the people, “Look, this stone shall serve as a witness against us, for it has heard all the words of the LORD which He spoke to us; so it shall be a witness against you, so that [afterward] you do not deny your God.” 28Then Joshua sent the people away, each to [the territory of] his inheritance.\n\nJoshua’s Death and Burial 29It happened after these things that Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died, at the age of a hundred and ten years. 30They buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-serah, which is in the hill country of Ephraim, on the north side of Mount Gaash.\n\n31Israel served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, and had known all the works of the LORD which He had done for Israel.\n\n32Now they buried the bones of Joseph, which the children of Israel brought up from Egypt, at Shechem, in the plot of land which Jacob had bought from the sons of Hamor the father of Shechem for a hundred pieces of money; and it became the inheritance of the sons of Joseph. 33And Eleazar [the priest], the son of Aaron died; and they buried him at Gibeah [on the hill] of Phinehas his son, which had been given to him in the hill country of Ephraim."

          "content": "Judges 1\nJerusalem Is Captured\n\n1Now it came about after the death of Joshua, that the sons (descendants) of Israel (Jacob) asked the LORD, “Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them?” 2And the LORD said, “Judah shall go up [first]; behold, I have given the land into his hand.” 3And [the tribe of the sons of] Judah said to [the tribe of the sons of] Simeon his brother, “Come up with me into my allotted territory, so that we may fight against the Canaanites; and I likewise will go with you into your allotted territory.” So Simeon went with him. 4Then Judah went up, and the LORD gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they struck down in defeat ten thousand men at Bezek. 5Then they found Adoni-bezek in Bezek and fought against him, and they struck down in defeat the Canaanites and the Perizzites. 6But Adoni-bezek fled; and they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. 7Adoni-bezek said, “Seventy kings with their thumbs and big toes cut off used to gather up scraps of food under my table; as I have done [to others], so God has repaid me.” So they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there.\n\n8Then the sons of Judah fought against [Jebusite] Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. 9Afterward the sons of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negev (South country) and in the lowland. 10So Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (the name of Hebron formerly was Kiriath-arba); and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai.\n\nCapture of Other Cities 11From there [the tribe of] Judah went against the inhabitants of Debir (the name of Debir formerly was Kiriath-sepher [city of books and scribes]). 12And Caleb said, “Whoever attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will even give him my daughter Achsah as a wife.” 13Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it; so he gave him his daughter Achsah as a wife. 14When she came to Othniel, she persuaded him to [allow her to] ask her father [Caleb] for a field. Then she [rode up to Caleb and] dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, “What do you want?” 15She said to him, “Give me a blessing; since you have given me the land of the Negev (South country), give me springs of water, too.” So Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs.\n\n16The sons of [Jethro] the Kenite, Moses’ father-in-law, went up from the City of Palms (Jericho) with the sons of Judah, to the wilderness of Judah which is in the Negev (South country) near Arad; and they went and lived with the people. 17Then [the warriors of the tribe of] Judah went with [the warriors of the tribe of] Simeon his brother, and they struck the Canaanites living in Zephath and utterly destroyed it. So the city was called Hormah (destruction). 18Also [the warriors of] Judah captured Gaza with its territory and Ashkelon with its territory and Ekron with its territory. 19The LORD was with Judah, and [the tribe of] Judah took possession of the hill country, but they could not dispossess and drive out those inhabiting the valley because they had iron chariots. 20Then they gave Hebron to Caleb, as Moses had said, and he drove out from there the three sons of Anak. 21But the sons of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who inhabited Jerusalem; so the Jebusites have lived with the sons of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day.\n\n22The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the LORD was with them. 23The house of Joseph spied out Bethel (now the name of the city was formerly Luz). 24The spies saw a man coming out of the city and they said to him, “Please show us the entrance to the city and we will treat you kindly.” 25So he showed them the entrance to the city, and they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go free. 26The man went into the land of the Hittites and built a city and named it Luz, which is its name to this day.\n\nPlaces Not Conquered 27But [the tribe of] Manasseh did not take possession of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages; so the Canaanites remained in that land. 28It happened when Israel became strong, that they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but they did not drive them out completely.\n\n29Neither did [the warriors of] Ephraim drive out the Canaanites who were living in Gezer; so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them.\n\n30[The warriors of the tribe of] Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron or of Nahalol; so the Canaanites lived among them and were put to forced labor.\n\n31[The warriors of the tribe of] Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon, or of Ahlab, or of Achzib, or of Helbah, or of Aphik, or of Rehob. 32So the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, because they did not drive them out.\n\n33Neither did [the warriors of] Naphtali drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, but they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land; and the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became forced labor for them.\n\n34Then the Amorites forced the sons of Dan [back] into the hill country, for they would not allow them to come down into the valley; 35yet the Amorites persisted in living on Mount Heres (the mountain of the sun), in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim; but when the power of the house (descendants) of Joseph became strong and prevailed, they became forced labor. 36The border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela (rock) and upward.\n\nJudges 2\nIsrael Rebuked\n\n1Now the Angel of the LORD came up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, “I brought you up from Egypt and led you to the land which I swore [to give] to your fathers; and I said, ‘I will never break My covenant with you, 2and as for you, you shall not make a covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall tear down their altars.’ But you have not obeyed Me; what is this that you have done? 3“So I also said, ‘I will not drive your enemies out before you; but they will be like thorns in your sides and their gods will be a snare to you.’” 4When the Angel of the LORD had spoken these words to all the Israelites, the people raised their voices and wept. 5So they named that place Bochim (weepers); and there they offered sacrifices to the LORD.\n\nJoshua Dies 6And when Joshua had sent the people away, the [tribes of the] Israelites went each to his inheritance, to take possession of the land. 7The people served the LORD all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work of the LORD which He had done for Israel. 8Then Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the LORD, died at the age of a hundred and ten. 9And they buried him in the territory of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of Mount Gaash. 10Also, all [the people of] that generation were gathered to their fathers [in death]; and another generation arose after them who did not know (recognize, understand) the LORD, nor even the work which He had done for Israel.\n\nIsrael Serves Baals 11Then the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD and worshiped and served the Baals, 12and they abandoned the LORD, the God of their fathers, who brought them out of the land of Egypt. They followed other gods from the gods of the peoples who were around them, and they bowed down to them, and offended and provoked the LORD to anger. 13So they abandoned the LORD and served Baal [the pagan god of the Canaanites] and the Ashtaroth. 14So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He gave them into the hands (power) of plunderers who robbed them; and He sold them into the hands of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer stand [in opposition] before their enemies. 15Wherever they went, the hand of the LORD was against them for evil (misfortune), as the LORD had spoken, and as the LORD had sworn to them, so that they were severely distressed.\n\n16Then the LORD raised up judges who rescued them from the hands of those who robbed them. 17Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they played the prostitute after other gods and they bowed down to them. They quickly turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked in obeying the commandments of the LORD; they did not do as their fathers. 18When the LORD raised up judges for them, He was with the judge and He rescued them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge; for the LORD was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who oppressed and afflicted them. 19But when the judge died, they turned back and behaved more corruptly than their fathers, in following and serving other gods, and bowing down to them. They did not abandon their practices or their stubborn ways. 20So the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He said, “Because this nation has transgressed (violated) My covenant (binding agreement) which I commanded their fathers, and has not listened to My voice, 21I also will no longer drive out before them any of the nations which Joshua left [to be conquered] when he died, 22in order to test [the loyalty of] Israel by them, whether Israel will keep the way of the LORD to walk in it, as their fathers did, or not.” 23So the LORD allowed those nations to remain, not driving them out at once; and He did not give them into the hand of Joshua.\n\nJudges 3\nIdolatry Leads To Servitude\n\n1Now these are the nations which the LORD left [in order] to test Israel by them (that is, all [the people of Israel] who had not [previously] experienced any of the wars in Canaan; 2only in order that the generations of the sons of Israel might be taught war, at least those who had not experienced it previously). 3The remaining nations are: the five lords (governors) of the Philistines, all the Canaanites, the Sidonians, and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon from Mount Baal-hermon to the entrance of Hamath. 4They were [allowed to remain] for the testing of Israel, to determine whether Israel would listen to and obey the commandments of the LORD, which He had commanded their fathers (ancestors) through Moses. 5And the Israelites lived among the Canaanites, Hittites, Amorites, Perizzites, Hivites, and Jebusites; 6and they took their daughters for themselves as wives and gave their own daughters to their sons, and served their [pagan] gods.\n\n7And the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD, and they forgot the LORD their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. 8So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia; and the Israelites served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. The First Judge Rescues Israel 9But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD [for help], the LORD raised up a man to rescue the people of Israel, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. 10The Spirit of the LORD came upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the LORD gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand, and he prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. 11And the land was at rest [from oppression for] forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died.\n\n12Now the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD strengthened Eglon king of Moab against Israel, since they had done what was evil in the sight of the LORD. 13And Eglon gathered to him the sons of Ammon and Amalek, and went and struck down Israel [in defeat], and they took possession of the City of Palm Trees (Jericho). 14And the Israelites served Eglon king of Moab eighteen years.\n\nEhud Rescues Israel from Moab 15But when the Israelites cried out to the LORD [for help], the LORD raised up a man to rescue them, Ehud the son of Gera, a Benjamite, a left-handed man. And the Israelites sent a gift of tribute by him to Eglon king of Moab. 16Now Ehud made for himself a sword a cubit long, which had two edges, and he bound it on his right thigh under his robe. 17And he brought the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. 18And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who had carried it. 19But Ehud himself turned back from the sculptured stones at Gilgal, [and he returned to Eglon] and said [to him], “I have a secret message for you, O king.” Eglon said “Keep silence.” And all who attended him left him. 20Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his [private] cool upper chamber, and Ehud said, “I have a message from God for you.” And the king got up from his seat. 21Then Ehud reached out with his left hand and took the sword from his right thigh, and plunged it into Eglon’s belly. 22And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, because Ehud did not draw the sword out of his belly; and the refuse came out. 23Then Ehud went out into the vestibule and shut the doors of the upper chamber behind him, and locked them.\n\n24When Ehud departed, Eglon’s servants came. And when they saw that the doors of the upper room were locked, they said, “He is only relieving himself in the cool room.” 25They waited [a very long time] until they became embarrassed and uneasy, but he still did not open the doors of the upper room. So [finally] they took the key and opened them, and behold, their master had fallen to the floor, dead.\n\n26Now Ehud escaped while they lingered, and he passed beyond the sculptured stones and escaped to Seirah. 27When he had arrived, he blew a trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim; and the sons of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was in front of them. 28And he said to them, “Pursue them, for the LORD has handed over your enemies the Moabites to you.” So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan opposite Moab and did not allow anyone to cross. 29They struck down at that time about ten thousand Moabite men, all strong, courageous men; not a man escaped. 30So Moab was subdued and humbled that day under the hand of Israel, and the land was at rest for eighty years.\n\nShamgar Rescues from Philistines 31After Ehud came Shamgar the son of Anath, who struck down six hundred Philistine men with an oxgoad. He too saved Israel.\n\nJudges 4\nDeborah And Barak Rescue From Canaanites\n\n1But the Israelites again did evil in the sight of the LORD, after Ehud died. 2So the LORD sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. 3Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD [for help], for Jabin had nine hundred iron chariots and had oppressed and tormented the sons of Israel severely for twenty years.\n\n4Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. 5She used to sit [to hear and decide disputes] under the palm tree of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim; and the Israelites came up to her for judgment. 6Now she sent word and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali, and said to him, “Behold, the LORD, the God of Israel, has commanded, ‘Go and march to Mount Tabor, and take with you ten thousand men [of war] from the tribes of Naphtali and Zebulun. 7‘I will draw out Sisera, the commander of Jabin’s army, with his chariots and his infantry to meet you at the river Kishon, and I will hand him over to you.’” 8Then Barak said to her, “If you will go with me, then I will go; but if you will not go with me, I will not go.” 9She said, “I will certainly go with you; nevertheless, the journey that you are about to take will not be for your honor and glory, because the LORD will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman.” Then Deborah got up and went with Barak to Kedesh. 10And Barak summoned [the fighting men of the tribes of] Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh, and ten thousand men went up under his command; Deborah also went up with him.\n\n11Now Heber the Kenite had separated himself from the Kenites, from the sons of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the terebinth tree in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh.\n\n12When someone told Sisera that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, 13Sisera called together all his chariots, nine hundred iron chariots, and all the people who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. 14Deborah said to Barak, “Arise! For this is the day when the LORD has given Sisera into your hand. Has the LORD not gone out before you?” So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with ten thousand men following him. 15And the LORD routed Sisera and all his chariots and [confused] all his army with the edge of the sword before Barak; and Sisera dismounted from his chariot and fled away on foot. 16But Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and the entire army of Sisera fell by the sword; not even one man was left.\n\n17But Sisera fled on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, because there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. 18Jael went out to meet Sisera, and said to him, “Turn aside, my lord, turn aside to me! Have no fear.” So he turned aside to her [and went] into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. 19And he said to her, “Please give me a little water to drink because I am thirsty.” And she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink; then she covered him. 20And he said to her, “Stand at the door of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, ‘Is there anyone here?’ tell him, ‘No.’” 21But Jael, Heber’s wife, took a tent peg and a hammer in her hand, and came up quietly to him and drove the peg through his temple, and it went through into the ground; for he was sound asleep and exhausted. So he died. 22And behold, as Barak pursued Sisera, Jael came out to meet him and said to him, “Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking.” And he entered [her tent] with her, and behold Sisera lay dead with the tent peg in his temple.\n\n23So on that day God subdued and humbled Jabin king of Canaan before the sons of Israel. 24And the hand of the sons of Israel pressed down heavier and heavier on Jabin king of Canaan, until they had destroyed him.\n\nJudges 5\nThe Song Of Deborah And Barak\n\n1Then Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam sang on that day, saying,\n2“For the leaders who took the lead in Israel,\nFor the people who volunteered [for battle],\nBless the LORD!\n3“Hear, O kings; listen, O rulers!\nI will sing to the LORD,\nI will sing praise to the LORD, the God of Israel.\n4“LORD, when You went out from Seir,\nWhen You marched from the field of Edom,\nThe earth quaked, the heavens also dripped,\nYes, the clouds dripped water.\n5“The mountains quaked at the presence of the LORD,\nYes, this Sinai, at the presence of the LORD, the God of Israel.\n6“In the days of Shamgar the son of Anath,\nIn the days of Jael, the highways were deserted,\nAnd travelers went by roundabout ways.\n7“The villagers ceased to be; they ceased in Israel\nUntil I, Deborah, arose,\nUntil I arose, a mother in Israel.\n8“They chose new gods;\nThen war was in the gates.\nWas there a shield or spear seen\nAmong forty thousand in Israel?\n9“My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel,\nThe volunteers among the people;\nBless the LORD!\n10“Sing of it, you who ride on white donkeys,\nYou who sit on rich carpets,\nAnd you who walk by the way.\n11“At the sound of those who divide flocks among the watering places,\nThere they shall recount the righteous acts of the LORD,\nThe righteous acts toward His villagers in Israel.\nThen the people of the LORD went down to the gates.\n12“Awake, awake, Deborah;\nAwake, awake, sing a song!\nArise, Barak, and lead away your captives, you son of Abinoam.\n13“Then down marched the survivors to the nobles;\nThe people of the LORD marched down for Me against the mighty.\n14“From Ephraim those whose root is in Amalek came down,\nAfter you, Benjamin, with your relatives;\nFrom Machir came down commanders and rulers,\nAnd from Zebulun those who handle the scepter of the scribe.\n15“And the heads of Issachar came with Deborah;\nAs Issachar, so was Barak;\nInto the valley they rushed at his heels;\nAmong the divisions of Reuben\nThere were great searchings of heart.\n16“Why [Reuben] did you linger among the sheepfolds,\nTo hear the piping for the flocks?\nAmong the divisions of Reuben\nThere were great searchings of heart.\n17“Gilead remained beyond the Jordan;\nAnd why did Dan live as an alien on ships?\nAsher sat [still] on the seacoast,\nAnd remained by its landings.\n[These did not come to battle for God’s people.]\n18“But Zebulun was a people who risked their lives to the [point of] death;\nNaphtali also, on the heights of the field.\n19“The kings came and fought;\nThen the kings of Canaan fought\nAt Taanach by the waters of Megiddo.\nSpoils of silver they did not obtain.\n20“From the heavens the stars fought,\nFrom their courses they fought against Sisera.\n21“The torrent Kishon swept the enemy away,\nThe ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon.\nO my soul, march on with strength.\n22“Then the horses’ hoofs beat [loudly]\nBecause of the galloping—the galloping of his valiant and powerful steeds.\n23‘Curse Meroz,’ said the messenger of the LORD,\n‘Utterly curse its inhabitants;\nBecause they did not come to the help of the LORD,\nTo the help of the LORD against the mighty.’\n24“Most blessed of women is Jael,\nThe wife of Heber the Kenite;\nMost blessed is she of women in the tent.\n25“Sisera asked for water and she gave him milk;\nShe brought him curds in a magnificent bowl.\n26“She reached out her [left] hand for the tent peg,\nAnd her right hand for the workmen’s hammer.\nThen she struck Sisera, she smashed his head;\nAnd she shattered and pierced his temple.\n27“He bowed, he fell, he lay [still] at her feet;\nAt her feet he bowed, he fell;\nWhere he bowed, there he fell dead.\n28“Out of the window she looked down and lamented (cried out in a shrill voice),\nThe mother of Sisera through the lattice,\n‘Why is his chariot delayed in coming?\nWhy have the hoofbeats of his chariots delayed?’\n29“Her wise ladies answered her,\nIndeed, she repeated her words to herself,\n30‘Are they not finding and dividing the spoil?\nA maiden (concubine) or two for every man;\nA spoil of dyed garments for Sisera,\nA spoil of dyed garments embroidered,\nTwo pieces of dyed garments embroidered for the neck of the plunderer?’\n31“So let all Your enemies perish, O LORD;\nBut let those who love Him be like the rising of the sun in its might.”\nAnd the land was at rest for forty years.\n\nJudges 6\nIsrael Oppressed By Midian\n\n1Then the Israelites did evil in the sight of the LORD; and the LORD gave them into the hand of Midian for seven years. 2The [powerful] hand of Midian prevailed against Israel. Because of Midian the sons of Israel made for themselves the dens (hideouts) which were in the mountains, and the caves and the [mountain] strongholds. 3For it was whenever Israel had sown [their seed] that the Midianites would come up with the Amalekites and the people of the east and go up against them. 4So they would camp against them and destroy the crops of the land as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel as well as no sheep, ox, or donkey. 5For they would come up with their livestock and their tents, and they would come in as numerous as locusts; both they and their camels were innumerable. So they came into the land to devastate it. 6So Israel was greatly impoverished because of the Midianites, and the Israelites cried out to the LORD [for help].\n\n7Now it came about when they cried out to the LORD because of Midian, 8that the LORD sent a prophet to the Israelites, and he said to them, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I brought you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery. 9‘And I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land, 10and I said to you, “I am the LORD your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you live.” But you have not listened to and obeyed My voice.’”\n\nGideon Is Visited 11Now the Angel of the LORD came and sat under the terebinth tree at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, and his son Gideon was beating wheat in the wine press [instead of the threshing floor] to [hide it and] save it from the Midianites. 12And the Angel of the LORD appeared to him and said to him, “The LORD is with you, O brave man.” 13But Gideon said to him, “Please my lord, if the LORD is with us, then why has all this happened to us? And where are all His wondrous works which our fathers told us about when they said, ‘Did not the LORD bring us up from Egypt?’ But now the LORD has abandoned us and put us into the hand of Midian.” 14The LORD turned to him and said, “Go in this strength of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?” 15But Gideon said to Him, “Please Lord, how am I to rescue Israel? Behold, my family is the least [significant] in Manasseh, and I am the youngest (smallest) in my father’s house.” 16The LORD answered him, “I will certainly be with you, and you will strike down the Midianites as [if they were only] one man.” 17Gideon replied to Him, “If I have found any favor in Your sight, then show me a sign that it is You who speaks with me. 18“Please do not depart from here until I come back to You, and bring my offering and place it before You.” And He said, “I will wait until you return.”\n\n19Then Gideon went and prepared a young goat and unleavened bread from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket and the broth in a pot, and he brought the food to Him under the oak (terebinth) and presented it. 20The Angel of God said to him, “Take the meat and unleavened bread and lay them on this rock, and pour out the broth [over them].” And he did so. 21Then the Angel of the LORD put out the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the meat and the unleavened bread; and fire flared up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened bread. Then the Angel of the LORD vanished from his sight. 22When Gideon realized [without any doubt] that He was the Angel of the LORD, he declared, “Oh no, Lord GOD! For now I have seen the Angel of the LORD face to face [and I am doomed]!” 23The LORD said to him, “Peace to you, do not be afraid; you shall not die.” 24Then Gideon built an altar there to the LORD and named it The LORD is Peace. To this day it is still in Ophrah, of the Abiezrites.\n\n25Now on that same night the LORD said to Gideon, “Take your father’s bull, the second bull seven years old, and tear down the altar of Baal that belongs to your father, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it; 26and build an altar to the LORD your God on top of this mountain stronghold [with stones laid down] in an orderly way. Then take the second bull and offer a burnt sacrifice using the wood of the Asherah which you shall cut down.” 27Then Gideon took ten men of his servants and did just as the LORD had told him; but because he was too afraid of his father’s household (relatives) and the men of the city to do it during daylight, he did it at night.\n\nThe Altar of Baal Destroyed 28Early the next morning when the men of the city got up, they discovered that the altar of Baal was torn down, and the Asherah which was beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar which had been built. 29So they said to one another, “Who has done this thing?” When they searched about and inquired, they were told, “Gideon the son of Joash did it.” 30Then the men of the city said to Joash, “Bring out your son, so that he may be executed, because he has torn down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah which was beside it.” 31But Joash said to all who stood against him, “Will you plead for Baal? Will you save him? Whoever pleads for Baal shall be put to death while it is still morning. If Baal is a god, let him defend himself, because someone has torn down his altar.” 32Therefore on that day he named Gideon Jerubbaal, meaning, “Let Baal plead,” because he had torn down his altar.\n\n33Then all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the east assembled together; and they crossed over [the Jordan] and camped in the Valley of Jezreel. 34So the Spirit of the LORD clothed Gideon [and empowered him]; and he blew a trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called together [as a militia] to follow him. 35He sent messengers throughout [the tribe of] Manasseh, and the fighting men were also called together to follow him; and he sent messengers to [the tribes of] Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they came up to meet them.\n\nSign of the Fleece 36Then Gideon said to God, “If You are going to rescue Israel through me, as You have spoken, 37behold, I will put a fleece of [freshly sheared] wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew only on the fleece, and it is dry on all the ground [around it], then I will know that You will rescue Israel through me, as You have said.” 38And it was so. When he got up early the next morning and squeezed the dew out of the fleece, he wrung from it a bowl full of water. 39Then Gideon said to God, “Do not let your anger burn against me, so that I may speak once more. Please let me make a test once more with the fleece; now let only the fleece be dry, and let there be dew on all the ground.” 40God did so that night; for it was dry only on the fleece, and there was dew on all the ground [around it].\n\nJudges 7\nGideon’s 300 Chosen Men\n\n1Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) and all the people who were with him got up early and camped beside the spring of Harod; and the camp of Midian was north of them by the hill of Moreh in the valley.\n\n2Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are too many people with you for Me to hand over Midian to them, otherwise Israel will boast [about themselves] against Me, saying, ‘My own power has rescued me.’ 3“So now, proclaim in the hearing of the people, ‘Whoever is afraid and trembling, let him turn back and leave Mount Gilead.’” So twenty-two thousand men returned [home], but ten thousand remained.\n\n4Then the LORD said to Gideon, “There are still too many people; bring them down to the water and I will test them for you there. Therefore it shall be that he of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall go with you,’ he shall go with you; but everyone of whom I say to you, ‘This one shall not go with you,’ he shall not go.” 5So he brought the people down to the water, and the LORD said to Gideon, “You shall separate everyone who laps the water with his tongue as a dog laps, as well as everyone who kneels down to drink.” 6Now the number of those who lapped [the water], putting their hand to their mouth, was three hundred men, but all the rest of the people kneeled down to drink water. 7And the LORD told Gideon, “With the three hundred men who lapped I will rescue you, and will hand over the Midianites to you. Let all the other people go, each man to his home.” 8So the three hundred men took people’s provisions [for the journey] and their trumpets [made of rams’ horns] in their hands. And Gideon sent [away] all the other men of Israel, each to his tent, but kept the three hundred men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley.\n\n9Now on that same night the LORD said to Gideon, “Arise, go down against their camp, for I have given it into your hand. 10But if you are afraid to go down [by yourself], go with Purah your servant down to the camp, 11and you will hear what they say; and afterward you will have the courage to go down against the camp.” Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the army that was in the camp. 12Now the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the sons of the east were lying [camped] in the valley, as countless as locusts; and their camels were without number, as numerous as the sand on the seashore. 13When Gideon arrived, there was a man telling a dream to his friend. And he said, “Listen carefully, I had a dream: there was a loaf of barley bread tumbling into the camp of Midian, and it came to the tent and struck it so that it fell, and turned it upside down so that the tent lay flat.” 14And his friend replied, “This [dream] is nothing less than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel. God has given Midian and the entire camp into his hand.”\n\n15When Gideon heard the account of the dream and its interpretation, he bowed down in worship. Then he returned to the camp of Israel and said, “Arise, for the LORD has given the camp of Midian into your hand.” 16He divided the three hundred men into three companies, and he put trumpets and empty pitchers into the hands of all of them, with torches inside the pitchers. 17And he said to them, “Look at me, then do likewise. When I come to the edge of the camp, do just as I do. 18“When I and all who are with me blow the trumpet (ram’s horn), then all around the camp you also blow the trumpets and shout, ‘For the LORD and for Gideon!’”\n\nConfusion of the Enemy 19So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the edge of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when the guards had just been changed, and they blew the trumpets and smashed the pitchers that were in their hands. 20When three companies blew the trumpets and broke the pitchers, they held the torches in their left hands, and the trumpets in their right hands to blow, and they shouted, “A sword for the LORD and for Gideon!” 21Then each stood in his place around the camp; and the entire [Midianite] army ran, crying out as they fled. 22When Gideon’s men blew the three hundred trumpets, the LORD set the sword of one [Midianite] against another even throughout the whole army; and the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. 23The men of Israel were summoned together from [the tribes of] Naphtali and Asher and all Manasseh, and they pursued Midian.\n\n24Then Gideon sent messengers throughout the hill country of [the tribe of] Ephraim, saying, “Come down against the Midianites and take [control of] the waters before them [thereby cutting off the Midianites], as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan [River].” So all the men of Ephraim were assembled together and they took control of the waters, as far as Beth-barah and the Jordan. 25Then the men of Ephraim took the two leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb, and they killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and they killed Zeeb at the wine press of Zeeb, and pursued Midian; and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon from across the Jordan.\n\nJudges 8\nZebah And Zalmunna Routed\n\n1And the men of [the tribe of] Ephraim said to Gideon, “What is this thing that you have done to us, not calling us when you went to fight with Midian?” And they quarreled with him vehemently. 2But he said to them, “What have I done now [that is so significant] in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning (leftovers) of the grapes of [your tribe of] Ephraim better than the vintage (entire harvest) of [my clan of] Abiezer? 3“God has given the leaders of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb into your hands; and what was I able to do in comparison with you?” Then their anger toward him subsided when he made this statement.\n\n4So Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over [the river], he and the three hundred men who were with him—exhausted, yet [still] pursuing [the enemy]. 5He said to the men of Succoth, “Please give loaves of bread to the people who are following me since they are exhausted, and I am pursuing Zebah and Zalmunna, kings of Midian.” 6But the leaders of Succoth said, “Are Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hands, that we should give bread to your army?” 7Gideon said, “For that [response], when the LORD has handed over Zebah and Zalmunna to me, I will thrash your bodies with the thorns and briars of the wilderness.” 8He went from there up to Penuel and spoke similarly to them; and the men of Penuel answered him just as the men of Succoth had answered. 9So Gideon said also to the men of Penuel, “When I come again in peace, I will tear down this tower.”\n\n10Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their armies, about fifteen thousand [fighting] men, all who were left of the entire army of the sons of the east; for a hundred and twenty thousand swordsmen had fallen. 11Gideon went up by the route of those who lived in tents to the east of Nobah and Jogbehah, and he attacked their camp when the camp was unsuspecting. 12When Zebah and Zalmunna fled, he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and terrified the entire army.\n\n13Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. 14He captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And the youth wrote down for him [the names of] the leaders of Succoth and its elders, seventy-seven men. 15He came to the men of Succoth and said, “Look here, Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, ‘Are Zebah and Zalmunna now in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted?’” 16He took the elders of the city, and thorns of the wilderness and briars, and with them he punished the men of Succoth. 17He tore down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city.\n\n18Then Gideon said to Zebah and Zalmunna, “What kind of men were they whom you killed at Tabor?” And they replied, “They were like you, each one of them resembled the son of a king.” 19He said, “They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the LORD lives, if only you had let them live, I would not kill you.” 20So [to humiliate them] Gideon said to Jether his firstborn, “Stand up, and kill them!” But the youth did not draw his sword, because he was afraid, for he was still [just] a boy. 21Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, “Rise up yourself and strike us; for as the man is, so is his strength.” So Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and took the crescent amulets that were on their camels’ necks.\n\n22Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, “Rule [as king] over us, both you and your son, also your son’s son, for you have rescued us from the hand of Midian.” 23But Gideon said to them, “I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the LORD shall rule over you.” 24And Gideon said to them, “I would make a request of you, that each one of you give me an earring from his spoil.” For the Midianites had gold earrings, because they were Ishmaelites [who customarily wore them]. 25They answered, “We will certainly give them to you.” And they spread out a garment, and every one of them threw an earring there from his spoil. 26And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was seventeen hundred shekels of gold, apart from the crescent amulets and pendants and the purple garments which were worn by the kings of Midian, and apart from the chains that were on their camels’ necks. 27Gideon made [all the golden earrings into] an ephod [a sacred, high priest’s garment], and put it in his city of Ophrah, and all Israel worshiped it as an idol there, and it became a trap for Gideon and his household. Forty Years of Peace 28So Midian was subdued and humbled before the sons of Israel, and they no longer lifted up their heads [in pride]. And the land was at rest for forty years in the days of Gideon.\n\n29Jerubbaal (Gideon) the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. 30Now Gideon had seventy sons born to him, because he had many wives. 31And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, whom he named Abimelech. 32Gideon the son of Joash died at a good advanced age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father in Ophrah of the Abiezrites.\n\n33Then it came about, as soon as Gideon was dead, that the Israelites again played the prostitute with the Baals, and made Baal-berith their god. 34And the Israelites did not remember the LORD their God, who had rescued them from the hand of all their enemies on every side; 35nor did they show kindness to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon) in return for all the good that he had done for Israel.\n\nJudges 9\nAbimelech’s Conspiracy\n\n1Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal (Gideon) went to Shechem to his mother’s relatives, and said to them and to the whole clan of the household of his mother’s father, 2“Speak now in the hearing of all the leaders of Shechem, ‘Which is better for you, that seventy men, all of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one man rule over you?’ Also, remember that I am your own bone and flesh.” 3So his mother’s relatives spoke all these words concerning him so that all the leaders of Shechem could hear; and their hearts were inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, “He is our relative.” 4And they gave him seventy pieces of silver from the house of Baal-berith, with which Abimelech hired worthless and undisciplined men, and they followed (supported) him. 5Then he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and murdered his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, [in a public execution] on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left alive, because he had hidden himself. 6All the men of Shechem and all of Beth-millo assembled together, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak (terebinth) of the pillar (memorial stone) at Shechem.\n\n7When they told Jotham, he went and stood at the top of Mount Gerizim and shouted to them, “Hear me, O men of Shechem, so that God may hear you. 8Once the trees went forth to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, ‘Reign over us!’ 9But the olive tree said to them, ‘Should I give up my fatness by which God and men are honored, and go to wave over the trees?’ 10Then the trees said to the fig tree, ‘You come and reign over us!’ 11But the fig tree said to them, ‘Should I give up my sweetness and my good fruit, and go to wave over the trees?’ 12Then the trees said to the vine, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 13And the vine replied, ‘Should I give up my new wine, which makes God and men happy, and go to wave over the trees?’ 14Then all the trees said to the bramble, ‘You come and reign over us.’ 15So the bramble said to the trees, ‘If in truth you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade; but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon.’\n\n16“Now then, if you acted in truth and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house, and have dealt with him as he deserved— 17for my father fought for you and risked his life and rescued you from the hand of Midian; 18but you have risen against my father’s house today and have murdered his sons, seventy men, on one stone, and have made Abimelech, son of his maidservant, king over the people of Shechem, because he is your relative— 19if then you have acted in truth and integrity with Jerubbaal and his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. 20“But if not, may fire come out from Abimelech and devour the people of Shechem and Beth-millo; and may fire come out from the people of Shechem and Beth-millo, and devour Abimelech.” 21Then Jotham escaped and fled, and went to Beer and lived there because of Abimelech his brother.\n\nShechem and Abimelech Fall 22Abimelech ruled over Israel for three years. 23Then God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem; and the leaders of Shechem acted treacherously against Abimelech, 24so that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal (Gideon) might come [on the guilty], and that their [innocent] blood might be laid on Abimelech their brother, who had killed them, and on the leaders of Shechem, who strengthened his hands (encouraged him) to kill his brothers. 25The leaders of Shechem set men in ambush against Abimelech on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along the road; and it was reported to Abimelech.\n\n26Now Gaal the son of Ebed came with his relatives, and moved into Shechem; and the leaders of Shechem trusted him. 27They went out into the field, gathered the grapes of their vineyard and trod them, and held a festival; and they entered the house of their god, and they ate and drank, and cursed Abimelech. 28Gaal the son of Ebed said, “Who is Abimelech, and who is Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not [merely] the son of Jerubbaal and is Zebul not his lieutenant? Serve the men of Hamor the father (founder) of Shechem. Why then should we serve Abimelech? 29“If only this people were under my authority! Then I would remove Abimelech and say to him, ‘Increase [the size of] your army and come out [to fight].’”\n\n30When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger burned. 31He sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, “Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem; and they are stirring up the city against you. 32Now then, get up during the night, you and the people who are with you, and set up an ambush in the field. 33“Then in the morning, at sunrise, you will get up early and rush upon and attack the city; and when Gaal and the people who are with him come out against you, you shall do to them whatever you can.”\n\n34So Abimelech and all the people who were with him got up during the night, and set up an ambush against Shechem, in four companies. 35Now Gaal the son of Ebed came out and stood in the entrance of the city gate; then Abimelech and the people who were with him got up from the ambush. 36When Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, “Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops.” But Zebul said to him, “You are only seeing the shadow of the mountains as if they were men.” 37Gaal spoke again and said, “Look! People are coming down from the highest part of the land, and one company is coming by way of the sorcerers’ oak tree.” 38Then Zebul said to Gaal, “Where is your [boasting] mouth now, you who said, ‘Who is Abimelech that we should serve him?’ Is this not the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them!” 39So Gaal went out ahead of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. 40Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him; and many fell wounded as far as the entrance of the gate. 41Then Abimelech stayed at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives so that they could not remain in Shechem.\n\n42The next day the people went out to the field, and it was reported to Abimelech. 43So he took his people and divided them into three companies, and set an ambush in the field; and he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. And he rose up against them and struck them down. 44Then Abimelech and the company with him advanced forward and stood in the entrance of the city gate; the two other companies attacked all who were in the field and killed them. 45Abimelech fought against the city that entire day. He took the city and killed the people who were in it; he demolished the city and sowed it with salt.\n\n46When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard about it, they entered the inner chamber (stronghold) of the temple of El-berith (the god of a covenant). 47Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were assembled together. 48So Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people with him; and Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a branch from the trees, picked it up, and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the people with him, “What you have seen me do, hurry and do just as I have done.” 49So everyone of the people also cut down his branch and followed Abimelech, and they put the branches on top of the inner chamber and set it on fire over those inside, so that all the people in the Tower of Shechem also died, about a thousand men and women.\n\n50Then Abimelech went to Thebez, and camped against Thebez and took it. 51But there was a strong (fortified) tower in the center of the city, and all the men and women with all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in; and they went up on the roof of the tower. 52So Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it, and approached the entrance of the tower to burn it down with fire. 53But a certain woman threw an upper millstone [down] on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. 54Then he called quickly to the young man who was his armor bearer, and said to him, “Draw your sword and kill me, so that it will not be said of me, ‘A woman killed him.’” So the young man pierced him through, and he died. 55When the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, each departed to his home. 56In this way God repaid the wickedness of Abimelech, which he had done to his father [Jerubbaal] by killing his seventy brothers. 57Also God repaid all the wickedness of the men of Shechem on their heads, and the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal (Gideon) came upon them.\n\nJudges 10\nOppression Of Philistines And Ammonites\n\n1After Abimelech died, Tola the son of Puah, the son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, arose to save Israel; and he lived in Shamir, in the hill country of Ephraim. 2Tola judged Israel for twenty-three years; then he died and was buried in Shamir.\n\n3After him, Jair the Gileadite arose, and he judged Israel for twenty-two years. 4He had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty towns in the land of Gilead that are called Havvoth-jair (towns of Jair) to this day. 5And Jair died and was buried in Kamon.\n\n6Then the Israelites again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD; they served the Baals, the Ashtaroth (female deities), the gods of Aram (Syria), the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. They abandoned the LORD and did not serve Him. 7So the anger of the LORD was kindled against Israel, and He sold them into the hands of the Philistines and the Ammonites, 8and they oppressed and crushed Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the Israelites who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. 9The Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight against Judah, Benjamin, and the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was greatly distressed.\n\n10Then the Israelites cried out to the LORD [for help], saying, “We have sinned against You, because we have abandoned (rejected) our God and have served the Baals.” 11The LORD said to the Israelites, “Did I not rescue you from the Egyptians, the Amorites, the Ammonites, and the Philistines? 12Also when the Sidonians, the Amalekites, and the Maonites oppressed and crushed you, you cried out to Me, and I rescued you from their hands. 13Yet you have abandoned (rejected) Me and served other gods; therefore I will no longer rescue you. 14“Go, cry out to the gods you have chosen; let them rescue you in your time of distress.” 15The Israelites said to the LORD, “We have sinned, do to us whatever seems good to You; only please rescue us this day.” 16So they removed the foreign gods from among them and served the LORD; and He could bear the misery of Israel no longer.\n\n17Then the Ammonites were assembled together and they camped in Gilead. And the sons of Israel assembled and camped at Mizpah. 18The people, the leaders of Gilead (Israel) said to one another, “Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.”\n\nJudges 11\nJephthah The Ninth Judge\n\n1Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a brave warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was the father of Jephthah. 2Gilead’s wife bore him sons, and when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, “You shall not have an inheritance in our father’s house, because you are the son of another woman.” 3Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob; and worthless and unprincipled men gathered around Jephthah, and went out [on raids] with him.\n\n4Now it happened after a while that the Ammonites fought against Israel. 5When the Ammonites fought against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to get Jephthah from the land of Tob; 6and they said to Jephthah, “Come and be our leader, so that we may fight against the Ammonites.” 7But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “Did you not hate me and drive me from the house of my father? Why have you come to me now when you are in trouble?” 8The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “This is why we have turned to you now: that you may go with us and fight the Ammonites and become head over all the inhabitants of Gilead.” 9So Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, “If you take me back [home] to fight against the Ammonites and the LORD gives them over to me, will I [really] become your head?” 10The elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, “The LORD is the witness between us; be assured that we will do as you have said.” 11So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah repeated everything that he had promised before the LORD at Mizpah.\n\n12Now Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites, saying, “What is [the problem] between you and me, that you have come against me to fight in my land?” 13The Ammonites’ king replied to the messengers of Jephthah, “It is because Israel took away my land when they came up from Egypt, from the [river] Arnon as far as the Jabbok and [east of] the Jordan; so now, return those lands peaceably.” 14But Jephthah sent messengers again to the king of the Ammonites, 15and they said to him, “This is what Jephthah says: ‘Israel did not take the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites. 16‘For when they came up from Egypt, Israel walked through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh; 17then Israel sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, “Please let us pass through your land,” but the king of Edom would not listen. Also they sent word to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel stayed at Kadesh. 18‘Then they went through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab, and came to the east side of the land of Moab, and they camped on the other side of the [river] Arnon; but they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the [northern] boundary of Moab. 19‘Then Israel sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, “Please let us pass through your land to our place.” 20‘But Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory; so Sihon gathered together all his people and camped at Jahaz and fought against Israel. 21‘The LORD, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them; so Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, the inhabitants of that country. 22‘They took possession of all the territory of the Amorites, from the Arnon as far as the Jabbok, and from the wilderness [westward] as far as the Jordan. 23‘And now the LORD God of Israel has dispossessed and driven out the Amorites from before His people Israel, so [why] should you possess it? 24‘Do you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And everything that the LORD our God dispossessed before us, we will possess. 25‘Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever strive against Israel, or did he ever go to war against them? 26‘While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities along the banks of the Arnon for three hundred years, why did you not recover your lost lands during that time? 27‘So I have not sinned against you, but you are doing me wrong by making war against me; may the LORD, the [righteous] Judge, judge this day between the Israelites and the Ammonites.’” 28But the king of the Ammonites disregarded the message of Jephthah, which he sent to him.\n\nJephthah’s Tragic Vow 29Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh, and Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites. 30Jephthah made a vow to the LORD and said, “If You will indeed give the Ammonites into my hand, 31then whatever comes out of the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites, it shall be the LORD’S, and I will offer it up as a burnt offering.” 32Then Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight with them; and the LORD gave them into his hand. 33And from Aroer to the entrance of Minnith he struck them, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim (brook by the vineyard), with a very great defeat. So the Ammonites were subdued and humbled before the Israelites.\n\n34Then Jephthah came to his house at Mizpah, and this is what he saw: his daughter coming out to meet him with tambourines and with dancing. And she was his only child; except for her he had no son or daughter. 35And when he saw her, he tore his clothes [in grief] and said, “Alas, my daughter! You have brought me great disaster, and you are the cause of ruin to me; for I have made a vow to the LORD, and I cannot take it back.” 36And she said to him, “My father, you have made a vow to the LORD; do to me as you have vowed, since the LORD has taken vengeance for you on your enemies, the Ammonites.” 37And she said to her father, “Let this one thing be done for me; let me alone for two months, so that I may go to the mountains and weep over my virginity, I and my companions.” 38And he said, “Go.” So he sent her away for two months; and she left with her companions, and wept over her virginity on the mountains. 39At the end of two months she returned to her father, who did to her as he had vowed; and she had no relations with a man. It became a custom in Israel, 40that the daughters of Israel went yearly to tell the story of the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year.\n\nJudges 12\nJephthah And His Successors\n\n1The men of [the tribe of] Ephraim were summoned [to action], and they crossed over to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, “Why did you cross over to fight with the Ammonites without calling us to go with you? [For that] we will burn your house down upon you.” 2And Jephthah said to them, “My people and I were in a major conflict with the Ammonites, and when I called you [for help], you did not rescue me from their hand. 3“So when I saw that you were not coming to help me, I took my life in my hands and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the LORD handed them over to me. So why have you come up to me this day to fight against me?” 4Then Jephthah assembled all the men of Gilead and fought with [the tribe of] Ephraim; and the men of Gilead defeated Ephraim, because they had said, “You Gileadites are fugitives of Ephraim, in the midst of [the tribes of] Ephraim and Manasseh.” 5And the Gileadites took the fords of the Jordan opposite the Ephraimites; and when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, “Let me cross over,” the men of Gilead would say to him, “Are you an Ephraimite?” If he said, “No,” 6they said to him, “Then say ‘Shibboleth.’” And he said, “Sibboleth,” for he could not pronounce it correctly. Then they seized him and killed him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time forty-two thousand of the Ephraimites fell.\n\n7Jephthah judged Israel for six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in one of the cities of Gilead.\n\n8And after him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. 9He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters whom he gave in marriage outside the family, and he brought in thirty daughters [-in-law] from outside for his sons. He judged Israel for seven years. 10Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem.\n\n11After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel; and he judged Israel for ten years. 12Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun.\n\n13Now after him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. 14He had forty sons and thirty grandsons who rode on seventy donkeys; and he judged Israel for eight years. 15Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites.\n\nJudges 13\nPhilistines Oppress Again\n\n1Now Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the LORD, and the LORD gave them into the hands of the Philistines for forty years.\n\n2And there was a certain man of Zorah, of the family of the Danites, whose name was Manoah; and his wife was infertile and had no children. 3And the Angel of the LORD appeared to the woman and said to her, “Behold, you are infertile and have no children, but you shall conceive and give birth to a son. 4Therefore, be careful not to drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, and do not eat anything [ceremonially] unclean. 5“For behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the boy shall be a Nazirite [dedicated] to God from birth; and he shall begin to rescue Israel from the hands of the Philistines.” 6Then the woman went and told her husband, saying, “A Man of God came to me and his appearance was like the appearance of the Angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask Him where he came from, and he did not tell me his name. 7“But He said to me, ‘Behold, you shall conceive and give birth to a son, and now you shall not drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, nor eat anything [ceremonially] unclean, for the boy shall be a Nazirite to God from birth to the day of his death.’”\n\n8Then Manoah pleaded with the LORD and said, “O Lord, please let the Man of God whom You sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do for the boy who is to be born.” 9And God listened to the voice of Manoah; and the Angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field, but Manoah her husband was not with her. 10So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, “Behold, the Man who came to me the other day has appeared to me.” 11Then Manoah got up and followed his wife, and came to the Man and said to him, “Are you the Man who spoke to this woman?” He said, “I am.” 12And Manoah said, “Now when your words come true, what shall be the boy’s manner of life, and his vocation?” 13The Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “The woman must pay attention to everything that I said to her. 14“She may not eat anything that comes from the vine nor drink wine or [any other] intoxicating drink, nor eat anything [ceremonially] unclean. She shall observe everything that I commanded her.”\n\n15Then Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, “Please let us detain you and let us prepare a young goat for you [to eat].” 16The Angel of the LORD said to Manoah, “Though you detain me, I will not eat your food, but if you prepare a burnt offering, offer it to the LORD.” For Manoah did not know that he was the Angel of the LORD. 17Manoah said to the Angel of the LORD, “What is your name, so that when your words come true, we may honor you?” 18But the Angel of the LORD said to him, “Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful (miraculous)?” 19So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering and offered it on the rock to the LORD, and He performed miracles while Manoah and his wife looked on. 20For when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the Angel of the LORD ascended in the altar flame. When Manoah and his wife saw this they fell on their faces to the ground.\n\n21The Angel of the LORD did not appear again to Manoah or his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the Angel of the LORD. 22So Manoah said to his wife, “We will certainly die, because we have seen God.” 23But his [sensible] wife said to him, “If the LORD had desired to kill us, He would not have received a burnt offering and a grain offering from our hands, nor would He have shown us all these things, nor would He have announced such things as these at this time.”\n\n24So the woman [in due time] gave birth to a son and named him Samson; and the boy grew and the LORD blessed him. 25And the Spirit of the LORD began to stir him at times in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol.\n\nJudges 14\nSamson’s Marriage\n\n1Samson went down to Timnah and at Timnah he saw a woman, one of the daughters of the Philistines. 2So he went back and told his father and his mother, “I saw a woman in Timnah, one of the daughters of the Philistines; now get her for me as a wife.” 3But his father and mother said to him, “Is there no woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised (pagan) Philistines?” And Samson said to his father, “Get her for me, because she looks pleasing to me.” 4His father and mother did not know that it was of the LORD, and that He was seeking an occasion [to take action] against the Philistines. Now at that time the Philistines were ruling over Israel.\n\n5Then Samson went down to Timnah with his father and mother [to arrange the marriage], and they came as far as the vineyards of Timnah; and suddenly, a young lion came roaring toward him. 6The Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he tore the lion apart as one tears apart a young goat, and he had nothing at all in his hand; but he did not tell his father or mother what he had done. 7So he went down and talked with the woman; and she looked pleasing to Samson. 8When he returned later to take her, he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion; and behold, a swarm of bees and honey were in the body of the lion. 9So he scraped the honey out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. When he came to his father and mother, he gave them some, and they ate it; but he did not tell them he had taken the honey from the body of the lion.\n\n10His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for that was the customary thing for young men to do. 11When the people saw him, they brought thirty companions (wedding attendants) to be with him. Samson’s Riddle 12Then Samson said to them, “Let me now ask you a riddle; if you can tell me what it is within the seven days of the feast, and solve it, then I will give you thirty linen tunics (undergarments) and thirty changes of [outer] clothing. 13“But if you are unable to tell me [the answer], then you shall give me thirty linen tunics (undergarments) and thirty changes of [outer] clothing.” And they said to him, “Ask your riddle, so that we may hear it.” 14So he said to them,\n“Out of the eater came something to eat,\nAnd out of the strong came something sweet.”\nAnd they could not solve the riddle in three days.\n\n15Then on the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, “Persuade your husband to tell us [through you] the riddle, or we will burn you and your father’s household with fire. Have you invited us to make us poor? Is this not true?” 16So Samson’s wife wept before him and said, “You only hate me, you do not love me; you have asked my countrymen a riddle, and have not told [the answer] to me.” And he said to her, “Listen, I have not told my father or my mother [either], so [why] should I tell you?” 17However Samson’s wife wept before him seven days while their [wedding] feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her because she pressed him so hard. Then she told the riddle to her countrymen. 18So the men of the city said to Samson on the seventh day before sundown,\n“What is sweeter than honey?\nWhat is stronger than a lion?”\nAnd he said to them,\n“If you had not plowed with my heifer,\nYou would not have solved my riddle.”\n\n19Then the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and he went down to Ashkelon and killed thirty of them and took their gear, and gave changes of clothes to those who had explained the riddle. And his anger burned, and he went up to his father’s house. 20But Samson’s wife was given to his companion who had been his friend.\n\nJudges 15\nSamson Burns Philistine Crops\n\n1But after a while, in the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat [as a gift of reconciliation]; and he said, “I will go in to my wife in her room.” But her father would not allow him to go in. 2Her father said, “I really thought you utterly hated her; so I gave her to your companion. Is her younger sister not more beautiful than she? Please take her [as your wife] instead.” 3Samson said to them, “This time I shall be blameless in regard to the Philistines when I do them harm.” 4So Samson went and caught three hundred foxes, and took torches and turning the foxes tail to tail, he put a torch between each pair of tails. 5When he had set the torches ablaze, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines, and he burned up the heap of sheaves and the standing grain, along with the vineyards and olive groves. 6Then the Philistines said, “Who did this?” And they were told, “Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he took Samson’s wife and gave her to his [chief] companion [at the wedding feast].” So the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. 7Samson said to them, “If this is the way you act, be certain that I will take revenge on you, and [only] after that I will stop.” 8Then he struck them without mercy, a great slaughter; and he went down and lived in the cleft of the rock of Etam.\n\n9Then the [army of the] Philistines came up and camped in [the tribal territory of] Judah, and overran Lehi (Jawbone). 10The men of Judah said, “Why have you come up against us?” And they answered, “We have come up to bind Samson, in order to do to him as he has done to us.” 11Then three thousand men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam and said to Samson, “Have you not known that the Philistines are rulers over us? What is this that you have done to us?” He said to them, “As they did to me, so I have done to them.” 12They said to him, “We have come down to bind you, so that we may hand you over to the Philistines.” And Samson said to them, “Swear to me that you will not kill me.” 13So they said to him, “No, we will [only] bind you securely and place you into their hands; but we certainly will not kill you.” So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock [of Etam].\n\n14When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. And the Spirit of the LORD came upon him mightily, and the ropes on his arms were like flax (linen) that had been burned, and his bonds dropped off his hands. 15He found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, so he reached out his hand and took it and killed a thousand men with it. 16Then Samson said,\n“With the jawbone of a donkey,\nHeaps upon heaps,\nWith the jawbone of a donkey\nI have struck down a thousand men.”\n\n17When he finished speaking, he threw the jawbone from his hand; and he named that place Ramath-lehi (hill of the jawbone). 18Then Samson was very thirsty, and he called out to the LORD and said, “You have given this great victory through the hand of Your servant, and now am I to die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised (pagans)?” 19So God split open the hollow place that was at Lehi, and water came out of it. When Samson drank, his spirit (strength) returned and he was revived. Therefore he named it En-hakkore (spring which is calling), which is at Lehi to this day. 20And Samson judged Israel in the days of [occupation by] the Philistines for twenty years.\n\nJudges 16\nSamson’s Weakness\n\n1Then Samson went to Gaza and saw a prostitute there, and went in to her. 2The Gazites were told, “Samson has come here.” So they surrounded the place and waited all night at the gate of the city to ambush him. They kept quiet all night, saying, “In the morning, when it is light, we will kill him.” 3But Samson lay [resting] until midnight, then at midnight he got up and took hold of the doors of the city gate and the two door-posts, and pulled them up, [security] bar and all, and he put them on his shoulders and carried them up to the top of the hill which is opposite Hebron.\n\n4After this he fell in love with a [Philistine] woman [living] in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. 5So the [five] lords (governors) of the Philistines came to her and said to her, “Persuade him, and see where his great strength lies and [find out] how we may overpower him so that we may bind him to subdue him. And each of us will give you eleven hundred pieces of silver.” 6So Delilah said to Samson, “Please tell me where your great strength lies and with what you may be bound and subdued.” 7Samson said to her, “If they bind me with seven fresh cords (tendons) that have not been dried, then I will be weak and be like any [other] man.” 8Then the Philistine lords brought her seven fresh cords that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. 9Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner room. And she said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he broke the cords as a string of tow breaks when it touches fire. So [the secret of] his strength was not discovered.\n\n10Then Delilah said to Samson, “See now, you have mocked me and told me lies; now please tell me [truthfully] how you may be bound.” 11He said to her, “If they bind me tightly with new ropes that have not been used, then I will become weak and be like any [other] man.” 12So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And the men lying in ambush were in the inner room. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like [sewing] thread.\n\n13Then Delilah said to Samson, “Until now you have mocked me and told me lies; tell me [truthfully] with what you may be bound.” And he said to her, “If you weave the seven braids of my hair with the web [and fasten it with a pin, then I will become weak and be like any other man.” 14So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks (braids) of his hair and wove them into the web]. And she fastened it with the pin [of the loom] and said to him, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and pulled out the pin of the [weaver’s] loom and the web.\n\nDelilah Extracts His Secret 15Then she said to him, “How can you say, ‘I love you,’ when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times and have not told me where your great strength lies.” 16When she pressured him day after day with her words and pleaded with him, he was annoyed to death. 17Then [finally] he told her everything that was in his heart and said to her, “A razor has never been used on my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If I am shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I will become weak and be like any [other] man.”\n\n18Then Delilah realized that he had told her everything in his heart, so she sent and called for the Philistine lords, saying, “Come up this once, because he has told me everything in his heart.” Then the Philistine lords came up to her and brought the money [they had promised] in their hands. 19She made Samson sleep on her knees, and she called a man and had him shave off the seven braids of his head. Then she began to abuse Samson, and his strength left him. 20She said, “The Philistines are upon you, Samson!” And he awoke from his sleep and said, “I will go out as I have time after time and shake myself free.” For Samson did not know that the LORD had departed from him. 21Then the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes; and they brought him down to Gaza and bound him with [two] bronze chains; and he was forced to be a grinder [of grain into flour at the mill] in the prison. 22But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved off.\n\n23Now the Philistine lords gathered together to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god, and to celebrate, for they said,\n“Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hands!”\n\n24When the people saw Samson, they praised their god, for they said,\n“Our god has handed over our enemy to us,\nThe ravager of our country,\nWho has killed many of us.”\n\n25Now when they were in high spirits, they said, “Call for Samson, so that he may amuse us.” So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. 26Then Samson said to the boy who held him by the hand, “Let me feel the pillars on which the [roof of the] house rests, so that I may lean against them.” 27Now the house was full of men and women; all the Philistine lords were there, and on the flat roof were about three thousand men and women who looked on while Samson was entertaining them.\n\nSamson Is Avenged 28Then Samson called to the LORD and said, “O Lord GOD, please remember me and please strengthen me just this one time, O God, and let me take vengeance on the Philistines for my two eyes.” 29Samson took hold of the two middle [support] pillars on which the house rested, and braced himself against them, one with his right hand and the other with his left. 30And Samson said, “Let me die with the Philistines!” And he stretched out with all his might [collapsing the support pillars], and the house fell on the lords and on all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life. 31Then his brothers and his father’s entire [tribal] household came down, took him, and brought him up; and they buried him in the tomb of Manoah his father, [which was] between Zorah and Eshtaol. So Samson had judged Israel for twenty years.\n\nJudges 17\nMicah’s Idolatry\n\n1There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim whose name was Micah. 2And he said to his mother, “The eleven hundred pieces of silver which were taken from you, about which you cursed [the thief] and also spoke about in my hearing, behold, the silver is with me; I took it.” And his mother said, “Blessed be my son before the LORD.” 3He returned the eleven hundred pieces of silver to his mother, and she said, “I had truly dedicated the silver from my hand to the LORD for my son (in his name) to make an image [carved from wood and plated with silver] and a cast image [of solid silver]; so now, I will return it to you.” 4So when he returned the silver to his mother, she took two hundred pieces of silver and gave them to the silversmith who made of it an image [of silver-plated wood] and a cast image [of solid silver]; and they were in the house of Micah. 5Now the man Micah had a house of gods (shrine), and he made an ephod and teraphim and dedicated and installed one of his sons, who became his [personal] priest. 6In those days there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes.\n\n7Now there was a young man from Bethlehem in Judah, from the family [of the tribe] of Judah, who was a Levite; and he was staying there [temporarily]. 8Then the man left the town of Bethlehem in Judah, to stay wherever he could find a place; and as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah. 9Micah said to him, “Where do you come from?” And he said to him, “I am a Levite from Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to stay wherever I can find a place.” 10And Micah said to him, “Live here with me and be a father and a [personal] priest to me, and I will give you ten pieces of silver each year, a supply of clothing, and your sustenance (room and board).” So the Levite went in. 11The Levite agreed to live with the man, and the young man became to Micah like one of his sons. 12So Micah dedicated (installed) the Levite, and the young man became his priest and lived in the house of Micah. 13Then Micah said, “Now I know that the LORD will favor me and make me prosper because I have a Levite as my priest.”\n\nJudges 18\nDanites Seek Territory\n\n1In those days there was no king in Israel; and in those days the tribe of the Danites was seeking an inheritance [of land] for themselves to live in, for until then an inheritance had not been allotted to them as a possession among the tribes of Israel. 2So the sons of Dan sent from the total number of their [extended] family five brave men from Zorah and Eshtaol, to scout the land and to explore it; and they said to them, “Go, explore the land.” They came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. 3When they passed near Micah’s house, they recognized the voice of the young man, the Levite, and they turned aside there and said to him, “Who brought you here? And what are you doing in this place? And what do you have here?” 4And he said to them, “Micah has done this and that for me, and he has hired me and I have become his priest.” 5And they said to him, “Please ask of God, so that we may know whether our journey on which we are going will be successful.” 6The priest said to them, “Go in peace; the journey on which you are going is acceptable to the LORD.”\n\n7Then the five men went on and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, [how they were] living securely in the style of the Sidonians, quiet and peaceful; and there was no oppressive magistrate in the land humiliating them in anything, and they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. 8The five men came back [home] to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, and their brothers said to them, “What do you have to report?” 9They said, “Arise, let us go up against them; for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good (fertile). Will you sit still and do nothing? Do not hesitate to go, to enter, to take possession of the land. 10“When you enter, you will come to people [feeling] safe and secure with a spacious land [widely extended on all sides]; for God has given it into your hands—a place where there is no lack of anything that is on the earth.”\n\n11Then from the [tribal] family of the Danites, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, six hundred men armed with weapons of war set out. 12They went up and camped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. Therefore they have called that place Mahaneh-dan to this day; it is west of Kiriath-jearim. 13They went on from there to the hill country of Ephraim and came to Micah’s house.\n\nDanites Take Micah’s Idols 14Then the five men who had gone to scout the country of Laish said to their relatives, “Do you know that there are in these houses an ephod, teraphim, an image [of silver-plated wood], and a cast image [of solid silver]? Now therefore, consider what you should do.” 15So they turned in that direction and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him how he was doing. 16Now the six hundred men armed with their weapons of war, who were of the sons of Dan, stood at the entrance of the gate. 17Now the five men who had gone to scout the land went up and entered the house and took the image [of silver-plated wood], the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image [of solid silver], while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the six hundred men armed with weapons of war. 18When these [five men] went into Micah’s house and took the [plated] image, the ephod, the teraphim, and the cast image, the priest asked them, “What are you doing?” 19They said to him, “Keep quiet, put your hand over your mouth and come with us, and be a father and a priest to us. Is it better for you to be a priest to the house of one man, or to be a priest to a tribe and family in Israel?” 20The priest’s heart was glad [to hear that], and he took the ephod, the teraphim, and the image, and went among the people.\n\n21So they turned and left, and they put the children, the livestock, and the valuables and supplies in front of them. 22When they had gone some distance from the house of Micah, the men who were [living] in the houses near Micah’s house assembled [as a militia] and overtook the sons of Dan. 23They shouted to the Danites, who turned and said to Micah, “What is your reason for assembling [against us]?” 24He said, “You have taken away my gods which I have made, and the priest, and have gone away; what else do I have left? How can you say to me, ‘What is your reason?’” 25The sons of Dan said to him, “Do not let your voice [of complaint] be heard among us, or else angry men will assault you and you will lose your life, along with the lives of [everyone in] your household.” 26Then the Danites went on their way; and Micah saw that they were too strong for him, so he turned and went back to his house.\n\n27They took the [idolatrous] things that Micah had made, and his priest, and they came to Laish, to a people who were quiet and secure; and they struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. 28And there was no one to rescue them because it was far from Sidon and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley which belongs to Beth-rehob. And they rebuilt the city and lived in it. 29They named the city Dan, after Dan their forefather who was born to Israel (Jacob); however, the original name of the city was Laish. 30The [tribe of] the sons of Dan set up the image [of silver-plated wood] for themselves; and Jonathan the son of Gershom, the son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity and exile from the land. 31So they set up for themselves Micah’s [silver-plated wooden] image which he had made, and kept it throughout the time that the house (tabernacle) of God was at Shiloh.\n\nJudges 19\nA Levite’s Concubine Degraded\n\n1Now it happened in those days, when there was no king in Israel, that a certain Levite living [as an alien] in the most remote part of the hill country of Ephraim, who took a concubine for himself from Bethlehem in Judah. 2But his concubine was unfaithful to him, and left him and went to her father’s house in Bethlehem of Judah, and stayed there for a period of four months. 3Then her husband arose and went after her to speak kindly and tenderly to her in order to bring her back, taking with him his servant and a pair of donkeys. So she brought him into her father’s house, and when the father of the girl saw him, he was happy to meet him. 4So his father-in-law, the girl’s father, detained him; and he stayed there with him for three days. So they ate and drank, and he lodged there. 5On the fourth day they got up early in the morning, and the Levite prepared to leave; but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, “Strengthen yourself with a piece of bread, and afterward go your way.” 6So both men sat down and ate and drank together; and the girl’s father said to the man, “Please be willing to spend the night and enjoy yourself.” 7Then the man got up to leave, but his father-in-law urged him [strongly to remain]; so he spent the night there again. 8On the fifth day he got up early in the morning to leave, but the girl’s father said, “Please strengthen yourself, and wait until the end of the day.” So both of them ate. 9When the man and his concubine and his servant got up to leave, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, “Behold, now the day has drawn to a close; please spend the night. Look, now the day comes to an end; spend the night here and celebrate, enjoy yourself. Then tomorrow you may get up early for your journey and go home.”\n\n10But the man was not willing to stay the night; so he got up and left and came to a place opposite Jebus (that is Jerusalem). With him were two saddled donkeys [and his servant] and his concubine. 11When they were near Jebus, the day was almost gone, and the servant said to his master, “Please come and let us turn aside into this Jebusite city and spend the night in it.” 12But his master said to him, “We will not turn aside into a city of foreigners who are not of the sons (descendants) of Israel. We will go on as far as Gibeah.” 13And he said to his servant, “Come and let us approach one of these places: and we will spend the night in Gibeah or in Ramah.” 14So they passed by and went on their way, and the sun set on them near Gibeah, which belongs to [the tribe of] Benjamin, 15and they turned aside there to go in and spend the night in Gibeah. And the Levite went in and sat down in the open square of the city, because no man invited them into his house to spend the night.\n\n16Then behold, there was an old man who was coming out of the field from his work at evening. He was from the hill country of Ephraim but was staying in Gibeah, and the men of the place were sons (descendants) of Benjamin. 17When he looked up, he saw the traveler [and his companions] in the city square; and the old man said, “Where are you going, and where do you come from?” 18The Levite replied, “We are passing through from Bethlehem [in the territory] of Judah to the most remote part of the hill country of Ephraim; I am from there. I went to Bethlehem of Judah, but I am now going [home] to my house, and there is no man [in the city] who will take me into his house [for the night]. 19“Yet we have both straw and feed for our donkeys, and also bread and wine for me, and for your handmaid, and for the young man who is with your servant; there is no lack of anything.” 20Then the old man said, “Peace be to you. Only leave all your needs to me; and do not spend the night in the open square.” 21So he brought him into his house and fed the donkeys; and they washed their feet and ate and drank.\n\n22While they were celebrating, behold, men of the city, certain worthless and evil men, surrounded the house, pounding on the door; and they spoke to the master of the house, the old man, saying, “Bring out the man who came to your house so that we may have relations with him.” 23Then the man, the master of the house, went out and said to them, “No, my fellow citizens, please do not act so wickedly. Since this man has come to my house [as my guest], do not commit this sacrilege. 24“Here is my virgin daughter and this man’s concubine. I will bring them out now; abuse and humiliate them and do to them whatever you want, but do not commit this act of sacrilege against this man.” 25But the men would not listen to him. So the man took the Levite’s concubine and brought her outside to them; and they had relations with her and abused her all night until morning; and when daybreak came, they let her go. 26At daybreak the woman came and collapsed at the door of the man’s house where her master was, until it was [fully] light.\n\n27When her master got up in the morning and opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, he saw his concubine lying at the door of the house, and her hands were on the threshold. 28He said to her, “Get up, and let us go.” But there was no answer [for she had died]. Then he put her [body] on the donkey; and the man left and went home. 29When he arrived at his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his [dead] concubine, he cut her [corpse] limb by limb into twelve pieces, and sent her [body parts] throughout all the territory of Israel. 30All who saw the dismembered parts said, “Nothing like this has ever happened or been seen from the day that the sons of Israel came up from the land of Egypt to this day. Consider it, take counsel, and speak [your minds]!”\n\nJudges 20\nResolve To Punish The Guilty\n\n1Then all the sons of Israel from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], including the land of Gilead came out, and the congregation assembled as one man to the LORD at Mizpah. 2The chiefs of all the people of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, four hundred thousand men on foot who drew the sword. 3(Now the Benjamites [in whose territory the crime was committed] heard that the [other tribes of the] sons of Israel had gone up to Mizpah.) And the sons of Israel said, “How did this evil thing happen?” 4So the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, replied, “I had come with my concubine to spend the night in Gibeah, [a town] which belongs to [the tribe of] Benjamin. 5But the men of Gibeah rose up against me and surrounded the house at night because of me. They intended to kill me, but instead they raped my concubine [so brutally] that she died. 6So I took my concubine and cut her [corpse] in pieces and sent her [body parts] throughout the land of the inheritance of Israel; for the men of Gibeah have committed a lewd and disgraceful act in Israel. 7“Now then, all you sons of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here [regarding what should be done].”\n\n8Then all the people stood [unified] as one man, saying, “None of us will go to his tent, and none of us will return to his home [until this is settled]. 9But now this is the thing which we will do to Gibeah; we will go up by lot against it, 10and we will take ten men out of a hundred throughout the tribes of Israel, and a hundred out of a thousand, and a thousand out of ten thousand to bring provisions for the men, so that when they come to Gibeah of Benjamin, they may punish them for all the despicable acts which they have committed in Israel.” 11So all the men of Israel assembled against the city, united as one man.\n\n12Then the tribes of Israel sent men through the entire tribe of Benjamin, saying, “What is this evil thing that has been done among you? 13“Now therefore, turn over the men [involved], the worthless and wicked men in Gibeah, so that we may put them to death and remove this wickedness from Israel.” But the Benjamites would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the sons of Israel. 14Then the [tribe of the] sons of Benjamin gathered from the cities to Gibeah, to go out to battle against the [other] sons of Israel. 15And the Benjamites assembled out of their cities at that time twenty-six thousand men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who assembled seven hundred chosen men. 16Out of all these people were seven hundred choice left-handed men; each one could sling stones at [a target no wider than] a hair and not miss.\n\n17Then the men of Israel, other than Benjamin, assembled four hundred thousand men who drew the sword; all of these were men of war.\n\nCivil War, Benjamin Defeated 18The men of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and asked of God and said, “Which of us shall take the lead to battle against the sons [tribe] of Benjamin?” And the LORD said, “Judah [shall go up] first.”\n\n19Then the [fighting men of the] sons of Israel arose in the morning and camped against Gibeah. 20The men of Israel went out to battle against Benjamin, and assembled in battle formation against them at Gibeah. 21The sons of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and struck to the ground on that day twenty-two thousand [fighting] men of Israel. 22But the people, the [fighting] men of Israel, took courage and strengthened themselves and again set their battle line in the same place where they formed it the first day. 23The sons of Israel went up and wept before the LORD until evening, and asked of the LORD, “Shall we advance again to battle against the sons of our brother Benjamin?” And the LORD said, “Go up against them.”\n\n24So the sons of Israel came against the sons of Benjamin the second day. 25And [the fighting men from the tribe of] Benjamin went out of Gibeah against them the second day and again struck to the ground the sons of Israel, eighteen thousand men, all of whom were swordsmen. 26Then all the sons of Israel and all the people went up and came to Bethel and wept; and they sat there before the LORD and fasted that day until evening and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 27And the sons of Israel inquired of the LORD (for the ark of the covenant of God was there [at Bethel] in those days, 28and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days), saying, “Shall I yet again go out to battle against the sons of my brother Benjamin, or shall I quit?” And the LORD said, “Go up, for tomorrow I will hand them over to you.”\n\n29So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. 30The [fighting men of the] sons of Israel went up against the sons of Benjamin on the third day and placed themselves in battle formation against Gibeah as at other times. 31The Benjamites went out against their army and were lured away from the city, and they began to strike and kill some of the people as at other times, on the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel. 32And the Benjamites said, “They are defeated before us, as at the first.” But the sons of Israel said, “Let us flee and lure them away from the city to the highways.” 33Then all the men of Israel got up from their places and placed themselves in battle formation at Baal-tamar; and the men of Israel [who were] in ambush rushed from their place in the plain of Maareh-geba. 34When the ten thousand choice [fighting] men from all Israel came against Gibeah, the battle was hard and fierce; but the Benjamites did not realize that disaster was about to strike them. 35And the LORD struck down [the tribe of] Benjamin before Israel, so that the sons of Israel destroyed twenty-five thousand one hundred men of Benjamin that day, all of whom were swordsmen.\n\n36So the Benjamites realized that they were defeated. Then men of Israel gave ground to the Benjamites, because they relied on the men in ambush whom they had placed against Gibeah. 37Then the men in ambush quickly rushed and attacked Gibeah; and the men in ambush also deployed and struck the entire city with the edge of the sword. 38Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in ambush was that they would make a great cloud of smoke rise from the city. 39So the men of Israel turned in the battle, and Benjamin began to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel, for they said, “Certainly they are defeated before us as in the first battle!” 40But when the [signal] cloud began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjamites looked behind them; and behold, the entire city went up in smoke to heaven. 41When the men of Israel turned back again, the men of Benjamin were terrified, for they saw that disaster had fallen upon them. 42Therefore, they turned their backs before the men of Israel [and fled] toward the direction of the wilderness, but the battle followed and overtook them. As the [fighting men of the] sons of Benjamin ran among them, the Israelites of the cities came out and destroyed them. 43They surrounded [the men of] Benjamin, pursued them relentlessly, and overtook them opposite Gibeah toward the east. 44Thus eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of these brave and able warriors. 45The survivors [of Benjamin] turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon, and Israel caught five thousand of them on the roads and overtook them at Gidom and killed two thousand of them. 46So all of Benjamin who fell that day were twenty-five thousand men who drew the sword, all of them brave and able warriors. 47But six hundred men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and stayed at the rock of Rimmon for four months. 48The men of Israel turned back against [the tribe of] the sons of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, both the entire city [of Gibeah] and the livestock and all that they found. They also set on fire all the [surrounding] towns which they found.\n\nJudges 21\nMourning The Lost Tribe\n\n1Now the men of Israel had sworn [an oath] at Mizpah, “None of us shall give his daughter in marriage to [a man of] Benjamin.” 2So the people came to Bethel and sat there before God until evening, and lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. 3They said, “O LORD, God of Israel, why has this come about in Israel, that there should be today one tribe missing from Israel?” 4And the next day the people got up early and built an altar there and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings.\n\n5Then the sons of Israel said, “Which one from all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the LORD?” For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the LORD at Mizpah, saying, “He shall certainly be put to death.” 6And the sons of Israel felt sorry [and had compassion] for their brother Benjamin and said, “One tribe has been cut off from Israel today. 7“What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn [an oath] by the LORD that we will not give them any of our daughters as wives?”\n\nProvision for Their Survival 8And they said, “Which one is there of the tribes from Israel that did not come up to Mizpah to the LORD?” And behold, [it was discovered that] no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly. 9For when the people were assembled, behold, there was not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead there. 10And the congregation sent twelve thousand of the most courageous men there, and commanded them saying, “Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the sword, including the women and the children. 11“And this is the thing that you shall do; you shall utterly destroy every male and every woman who is not a virgin.” 12And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead four hundred young virgins who had not known a man intimately; and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan.\n\n13Then the whole congregation sent word to the [surviving] sons of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon, and proclaimed peace to them. 14So [the survivors of] Benjamin returned at that time, and they gave them the women whom they had kept alive from the women of Jabesh-gilead; but there were not enough [to provide wives] for them. 15And the people were sorry [and had compassion] for [the survivors of the tribe of] Benjamin because the LORD had made a gap in the tribes of Israel.\n\n16Then the elders of the congregation said, “What shall we do for wives for those [men] who are left, since the women of Benjamin have been destroyed?” 17They said, “There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, so that a tribe will not be wiped out from Israel. 18“But we cannot give them wives from our daughters.” For the sons of Israel had sworn [an oath], “Cursed is he who gives a wife to [a man from the tribe of] Benjamin.”\n\n19So they said, “Listen, there is the yearly feast of the LORD at Shiloh, which is on the north side of Bethel, on the east side of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and on the south side of Lebonah.” 20So they instructed the sons of Benjamin, saying, “Go, set an ambush in the vineyards, 21and watch; if the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then you shall come out of the vineyards and each of you shall catch his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of [the tribe of] Benjamin. 22“When their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we shall say to them, ‘Give them to us voluntarily, because we did not take a wife for each man of Benjamin in battle, nor did you give wives to them, for that would have made you guilty [of breaking your oath].’” 23So the sons of [the tribe of] Benjamin did as instructed and took wives according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried away. Then they went and returned to their inheritance, and rebuilt the towns and lived in them. 24The sons of Israel departed from there at that time, each man to his tribe and family, and each man went from there to his inheritance.\n\n25In those days [when the judges governed] there was no king in Israel; every man did what was right in his own eyes."

          "content": "Ruth 1\nNaomi Widowed\n\n1In the days when the judges governed [Israel], there was a famine in the land [of Canaan]. And a certain man of Bethlehem in Judah went to live temporarily in the country of Moab with his wife and his two sons. 2The man’s name was Elimelech and his wife’s name was Naomi and his two sons were named Mahlon and Chilion. They were Ephrathites from Bethlehem in Judah. They went to the country of Moab and stayed there. 3Then Elimelech, Naomi’s husband, died, and she was left [a widow] with her two sons. 4They took wives from the Moabite women; the name of the one was Orpah, and the name of the other was Ruth. They lived there about ten years; 5and then both Mahlon and Chilion also died, so the woman [Naomi] was left without her two sons and her husband.\n\n6Then she set out with her daughters-in-law to return from the country of Moab, for she had heard in Moab how the LORD had taken care of His people [of Judah] in giving them food. 7So she left the place where she was living, her two daughters-in-law with her, and they started on the way back to the land of Judah. 8But Naomi said to her two daughters-in-law, “Go back, each of you return to your mother’s house. May the LORD show kindness to you as you have shown kindness to the dead and to me. 9“May the LORD grant that you find rest, each one in the home of her husband.” Then she kissed them [goodbye], and they wept aloud. 10And they said to her, “No, we will go with you to your people [in Judah].” 11But Naomi said, “Go back, my daughters, why should you go with me? Do I still have sons in my womb that may become your husbands? 12Go back, my daughters, go, for I am too old to have a husband. If I said I have hope, and if I actually had a husband tonight and even gave birth to sons, 13would you wait until they were grown? Would you go without marrying? No, my daughters; for it is much more difficult for me than for you, because the LORD’S hand has gone against me.” Ruth’s Loyalty 14Then they wept aloud again; and Orpah kissed her mother-in-law [goodbye], but Ruth clung to her.\n\n15Then Naomi said, “Look, your sister-in-law has gone back to her people and to her gods; turn back and follow your sister-in-law.” 16But Ruth said, “Do not urge me to leave you or to turn back from following you; for where you go, I will go, and where you lodge, I will lodge. Your people will be my people, and your God, my God. 17“Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried. May the LORD do the same to me [as He has done to you], and more also, if anything but death separates me from you.” 18When Naomi saw that Ruth was determined to go with her, she said nothing more.\n\n19So the two of them went on until they came to Bethlehem. And when they arrived in Bethlehem, the whole city was stirred because of them, and the women asked, “Is this Naomi?” 20She said to them, “Do not call me Naomi (sweetness); call me Mara (bitter), for the Almighty has caused me great grief and bitterness. 21“I left full [with a husband and two sons], but the LORD has brought me back empty. Why call me Naomi, since the LORD has testified against me and the Almighty has afflicted me?”\n\n22So Naomi returned from the country of Moab, and with her Ruth the Moabitess, her daughter-in-law. And they arrived in Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest.\n\nRuth 2\nRuth Gleans In Boaz’ Field\n\n1Now Naomi had a relative of her husband, a man of great wealth and influence, from the family of Elimelech, whose name was Boaz. 2And Ruth the Moabitess said to Naomi, “Please let me go to the field and glean among the ears of grain after one [of the reapers] in whose sight I may find favor.” Naomi said to her, “Go, my daughter.” 3So Ruth went and picked up the leftover grain in a field after the reapers; and she happened to stop at the plot of land belonging to Boaz, who was of the family of Elimelech. 4It was then that Boaz came back from Bethlehem and said to the reapers, “The LORD be with you!” And they answered him, “The LORD bless you!” 5Then Boaz said to his servant who was in charge of the reapers, “Whose young woman is this?” 6The servant in charge of the reapers answered, “She is the young Moabite woman who came back with Naomi from the country of Moab. 7“And she said, ‘Please let me glean and gather after the reapers among the sheaves.’ So she came and has continued [gathering grain] from early morning until now, except when she sat [resting] for a little while in the [field] house.”\n\n8Then Boaz said to Ruth, “Listen carefully, my daughter. Do not go to glean in another field or leave this one, but stay here close by my maids. 9“Watch which field they reap, and follow behind them. I have commanded the servants not to touch you. And when you are thirsty, go to the [water] jars and drink from what the servants draw.” 10Then she kneeled face downward, bowing to the ground, and said to him, “Why have I found favor in your eyes that you should notice me, when I am a foreigner?” 11Boaz answered her, “I have been made fully aware of everything that you have done for your mother-in-law since the death of your husband, and how you have left your father and mother and the land of your birth, and have come to a people that you did not know before. 12“May the LORD repay you for your kindness, and may your reward be full from the LORD, the God of Israel, under whose wings you have come to take refuge.” 13Then she said, “Let me find favor in your sight, my lord, for you have comforted me and have spoken kindly to your maidservant, though I am not as one of your maidservants.”\n\n14At mealtime Boaz said to her, “Come over here and eat some bread and dip your bread in the vinegar.” So she sat beside the reapers; and he served her roasted grain, and she ate until she was satisfied and she had some left [for Naomi]. 15When she got up to glean, Boaz ordered his servants, “Let her glean even among the sheaves, and do not insult her. 16“Also you shall purposely pull out for her some stalks [of grain] from the sheaves and leave them so that she may collect them, and do not rebuke her.”\n\n17So she gleaned in the field until evening. Then she beat out what she had gleaned, and it was about an ephah of barley. 18She picked it up and went into the city, and her mother-in-law saw what she had gleaned. Ruth also took out and gave to Naomi what she had saved after she [had eaten and] was satisfied. 19Her mother-in-law said to her, “Where did you glean today? Where did you work? Blessed be the man who took notice of you.” So she told her mother-in-law with whom she had worked and said, “The name of the man with whom I worked today is Boaz.” 20Naomi said to her daughter-in-law, “May he be blessed of the LORD who has not ceased His kindness to the living and to the dead.” Again Naomi said to her, “The man is one of our closest relatives, one who has the right to redeem us.” 21Then Ruth the Moabitess said, “He also said to me, ‘Stay close to my servants until they have harvested my entire crop.’” 22Naomi said to Ruth, “It is good, my daughter, for you to go out [to work] with his maids, so that others do not assault you in another field.” 23So she stayed close to the maids of Boaz, gleaning until the end of the barley and wheat harvests. And she lived with her mother-in-law.\n\nRuth 3\nBoaz Will Redeem Ruth\n\n1Then Naomi her mother-in-law said to Ruth, “My daughter, shall I not look for security and a home for you, so that it may be well with you? 2Now Boaz, with whose maids you were [working], is he not our relative? See now, he is winnowing barley at the threshing floor tonight. 3So wash and anoint yourself [with olive oil], then put on your [best] clothes, and go down to the threshing floor; but stay out of the man’s sight until he has finished eating and drinking. 4“When he lies down, notice the place where he is lying, and go and uncover his feet and lie down. Then he will tell you what to do.” 5Ruth answered her, “I will do everything that you say.”\n\n6So she went down to the threshing floor and did just as her mother-in-law had told her. 7When Boaz had eaten and drunk and his heart was happy, he went to lie down at the end of the stack of grain. Then Ruth came secretly, and uncovered his feet and lay down. 8In the middle of the night the man was startled and he turned over, and found a woman lying at his feet. 9So he said, “Who are you?” And she answered, “I am Ruth your maid. Spread the hem of your garment over me, for you are a close relative and redeemer.” 10Then he said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, my daughter. You have made your last kindness better than the first; for you have not gone after young men, whether poor or rich. 11Now, my daughter, do not be afraid. I will do for you whatever you ask, since all my people in the city know that you are a woman of excellence. 12It is true that I am your close relative and redeemer; however, there is a relative closer [to you] than I. 13“Spend the night [here], and in the morning if he will redeem you, fine; let him do it. But if he does not wish to redeem you, then, as the LORD lives, I will redeem you. Lie down until the morning.”\n\n14So she lay at his feet until the morning, but got up before anyone could recognize another; Boaz said, “Do not let it be known that the woman came to the threshing floor [last night].” 15He also said, “Give me the shawl you are wearing and hold it out.” So Ruth held it and he measured out six measures of barley [into it] and placed it on her. And she went into the city. 16When she came home, her mother-in-law said, “How did it go, my daughter?” And Ruth told her everything that the man had done for her. 17She said, “He gave me these six measures of barley, and he said to me, ‘Do not go back to your mother-in-law empty-handed.’” 18Then Naomi said, “Sit and wait, my daughter, until you learn how this matter turns out; for the man will not rest until he has settled it today.”\n\nRuth 4\nThe Marriage Of Ruth\n\n1Then Boaz went up to the city gate [where business and legal matters were settled] and sat down, and then the close relative (redeemer) of whom Boaz had spoken came by. He said to him, “Come over here, friend, and sit down.” So he came and sat down. 2Then Boaz took ten men from the elders of the city and said, “Sit down here.” And they sat down. 3He said to the closest relative (redeemer), “Naomi, who has returned from the country of Moab, must sell the plot of land which belonged to our brother Elimelech. 4“So I thought to let you hear of it, saying, ‘Buy it in the presence of those sitting here, and before the elders of my people. If you will redeem it, redeem it; but if not, then tell me, so that I may know; for there is no one besides you to redeem it, and I am [next of kin] after you.’” And he said, “I will redeem it.” 5Then Boaz said, “The day that you buy the field from Naomi, you must also acquire Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of the deceased, to restore the name of the deceased to his inheritance.” 6The closest relative (redeemer) said, “I cannot redeem it for myself, because [by marrying a Moabitess] I would jeopardize my own inheritance. Take my right of redemption (purchase) yourself, because I cannot redeem it.”\n\n7Now formerly in Israel this was the custom concerning redeeming and exchanging property. To confirm a transaction, a man pulled off his sandal and gave it to the other. This was the way of confirming and attesting in Israel. 8So, when the closest relative (redeemer) said to Boaz, “Buy it for yourself,” he pulled off his sandal [and gave it to Boaz to confirm the agreement]. 9Then Boaz said to the elders and to all the people, “You are witnesses this day that I have bought everything that was Elimelech’s and everything that was Chilion’s and Mahlon’s from the hand of Naomi. 10“I have also acquired Ruth the Moabitess, the widow of Mahlon, to be my wife to restore the name of the deceased to his inheritance, so that the name of the deceased will not be cut off from his brothers or from the gate of his birthplace. You are witnesses today.” 11All the people at the gate and the elders said, “We are witnesses. May the LORD make the woman who is coming into your house like Rachel and Leah, the two who built the household of Israel. May you achieve wealth and power in Ephrathah and become famous in Bethlehem. 12“Further, may your house be like the house of Perez whom Tamar bore to Judah, because of the offspring which the LORD will give you by this young woman.”\n\n13So Boaz took Ruth, and she became his wife. And he went in to her, and the LORD enabled her to conceive, and she gave birth to a son. 14Then the women said to Naomi, “Blessed is the LORD who has not left you without a redeemer (grandson, as heir) today, and may his name become famous in Israel. 15“May he also be to you one who restores life and sustains your old age; for your daughter-in-law, who loves you and is better to you than seven sons, has given birth to him.” The Line of David Began Here 16Then Naomi took the child and placed him in her lap, and she became his nurse. 17The neighbor women gave him a name, saying, “A son (grandson) has been born to Naomi.” They named him Obed (worshiper). He is the father of Jesse, the father of David [the ancestor of Jesus Christ].\n\n18Now these are the descendants of Perez: Perez was the father of Hezron, 19Hezron was the father of Ram, Ram the father of Amminadab, 20Amminadab the father of Nahshon, Nahshon the father of Salmon, 21Salmon the father of Boaz, Boaz the father of Obed, 22Obed the father of Jesse, and Jesse the father of David [the king of Israel and the ancestor of Jesus Christ]."

          "content": "1  Samuel 1 \nElkanah And His Wives\n\n1There was a certain man of Ramathaim-zophim, of the hill country of Ephraim, named Elkanah the son of Jeroham, the son of Elihu, the son of Tohu, the son of Zuph, an Ephraimite. 2He had two wives, one named Hannah and the other named Peninnah. Peninnah had children, but Hannah had none.\n\n3This man went up from his city each year to worship and sacrifice to the LORD of hosts at Shiloh. Hophni and Phinehas, the two sons of Eli, were priests to the LORD there. 4When the day came that Elkanah sacrificed, he would give portions [of the sacrificial meat] to Peninnah his wife and all her sons and daughters. 5But to Hannah he would give a double portion, because he loved Hannah, but the LORD had given her no children. 6Hannah’s rival provoked her bitterly, to irritate and embarrass her, because the LORD had left her childless. 7So it happened year after year, whenever she went up to the house of the LORD, Peninnah provoked her; so she wept and would not eat. 8Then Elkanah her husband said to her, “Hannah, why do you cry and why do you not eat? Why are you so sad and discontent? Am I not better to you than ten sons?”\n\n9So Hannah got up after eating and drinking in Shiloh. Now Eli the priest was sitting on his seat beside the doorpost of the temple (tabernacle) of the LORD. 10Hannah was greatly distressed, and she prayed to the LORD and wept in anguish. 11She made a vow, saying, “O LORD of hosts, if You will indeed look on the affliction (suffering) of Your maidservant and remember, and not forget Your maidservant, but will give Your maidservant a son, then I will give him to the LORD all the days of his life; a razor shall never touch his head.”\n\n12Now it happened as she continued praying before the LORD, that Eli was watching her mouth. 13Hannah was speaking in her heart (mind); only her lips were moving, and her voice was not heard, so Eli thought she was drunk. 14Eli said to her, “How long will you make yourself drunk? Get rid of your wine.” 15But Hannah answered, “No, my lord, I am a woman with a despairing spirit. I have not been drinking wine or any intoxicating drink, but I have poured out my soul before the LORD. 16“Do not regard your maidservant as a wicked and worthless woman, for I have spoken until now out of my great concern and [bitter] provocation.” 17Then Eli answered and said, “Go in peace; and may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of Him.” 18Hannah said, “Let your maidservant find grace and favor in your sight.” So the woman went on her way and ate, and her face was no longer sad.\n\nSamuel Is Born to Hannah 19The family got up early the next morning, worshiped before the LORD, and returned to their home in Ramah. Elkanah knew Hannah his wife, and the LORD remembered her [prayer]. 20It came about in due time, after Hannah had conceived, that she gave birth to a son; she named him Samuel, saying, “Because I have asked for him from the LORD.”\n\n21Then the man Elkanah and all his household went up to offer to the LORD the yearly sacrifice and pay his vow. 22But Hannah did not go up, for she said to her husband, “I will not go up until the child is weaned; and then I will bring him, so that he may appear before the LORD and remain there as long as he lives.” 23Elkanah her husband said to her, “Do what seems best to you. Wait until you have weaned him; only may the LORD establish and confirm His word.” So the woman remained [behind] and nursed her son until she weaned him. 24Now when she had weaned him, she took him up with her, along with a three-year-old bull, an ephah of flour, and a leather bottle of wine [to pour over the burnt offering for a sweet fragrance], and she brought Samuel to the LORD’S house in Shiloh, although the child was young. 25Then they slaughtered the bull, and brought the child to Eli. 26Hannah said, “Oh, my lord! As [surely as] your soul lives, my lord, I am the woman who stood beside you here, praying to the LORD. 27For this child I prayed, and the LORD has granted me my request which I asked of Him. 28“Therefore I have also dedicated him to the LORD; as long as he lives he is dedicated to the LORD.” And they worshiped the LORD there.\n\n1 Samuel 2\nHannah’s Song Of Thanksgiving\n\n1Hannah prayed and said,\n“My heart rejoices and triumphs in the LORD;\nMy horn (strength) is lifted up in the LORD,\nMy mouth has opened wide [to speak boldly] against my enemies,\nBecause I rejoice in Your salvation.\n2“There is no one holy like the LORD,\nThere is no one besides You,\nThere is no Rock like our God.\n3“Do not go on boasting so very proudly,\nDo not let arrogance come out of your mouth;\nFor the LORD is a God of knowledge,\nAnd by Him actions are weighed (examined).\n4“The bows of the mighty are broken,\nBut those who have stumbled equip themselves with strength.\n5“Those who were full hire themselves out for bread,\nBut those who were hungry cease [to hunger].\nEven the barren [woman] gives birth to seven,\nBut she who has many children withers away.\n6“The LORD puts to death and makes alive;\nHe brings down to Sheol (the grave) and raises up [from the grave].\n7“The LORD makes poor and makes rich;\nHe brings low and He lifts up.\n8“He raises up the poor from the dust,\nHe lifts up the needy from the ash heap\nTo make them sit with nobles,\nAnd inherit a seat of honor and glory;\nFor the pillars of the earth are the LORD’S,\nAnd He set the land on them.\n9“He guards the feet of His godly (faithful) ones,\nBut the wicked ones are silenced and perish in darkness;\nFor a man shall not prevail by might.\n10“The adversaries of the LORD will be broken to pieces;\nHe will thunder against them in the heavens,\nThe LORD will judge the ends of the earth;\nAnd He will give strength to His king,\nAnd will exalt the horn (strength) of His anointed.”\n\n11Elkanah [and his wife Hannah] returned to Ramah to his house. But the child [Samuel] served the LORD under the guidance of Eli the priest.\n\nThe Sin of Eli’s Sons 12The sons of Eli [Hophni and Phinehas] were worthless (dishonorable, unprincipled) men; they did not know [nor respect] the LORD 13and the custom of the priests with [the sacrifices of] the people. When any man was offering a sacrifice, the priest’s servant would come while the meat was boiling, with a three-pronged [meat] fork in his hand; 14then he would thrust it into the pan, or kettle, or caldron, or pot; everything that the fork brought up the priest would take for himself. This is what they did in Shiloh to all [the sacrifices of] the Israelites who came there. 15Also, before they burned (offered) the fat, the priest’s servant would come and say to the man who was sacrificing, “Give the priest meat to roast, since he will not accept boiled meat from you, only raw.” 16If the man said to him, “Certainly they are to burn (offer) the fat first, and then you may take as much as you want,” then the priest’s servant would say, “No! You shall give it to me now or I will take it by force.” 17So the sin of the [two] young men [Hophni and Phinehas] was very great before the LORD, for the men treated the offering of the LORD disrespectfully.\n\nSamuel before the LORD as a Boy 18Now Samuel was ministering before the LORD, as a child dressed in a linen ephod [a sacred item of priestly clothing]. 19Moreover, his mother would make him a little robe and would bring it up to him each year when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice. 20Then Eli would bless Elkanah and his wife and say, “May the LORD give you children by this woman in place of the one she asked for which was dedicated to the LORD.” Then they would return to their own home.\n\n21And [the time came when] the LORD visited Hannah, so that she conceived and gave birth to three sons and two daughters. And the boy Samuel grew before the LORD.\n\nEli Rebukes His Sons 22Now Eli was very old; and he heard about everything that his sons were doing to all [the people of] Israel, and how they were lying with the women who served at the entrance to the Tent of Meeting (tabernacle). 23Eli said to them, “Why do you do such things, the evil things that I hear from all these people? 24No, my sons; for the report that I keep hearing from the passers-by among the LORD’S people is not good. 25“If one man does wrong and sins against another, God will intercede (arbitrate) for him; but if a man does wrong to the LORD, who can intercede for him?” But they would not listen to their father, for it was the LORD’S will to put them to death.\n\n26But the boy Samuel continued to grow in stature and in favor both with the LORD and with men.\n\n27Then a man of God (prophet) came to Eli and said to him, “Thus says the LORD: ‘Did I not plainly reveal Myself to the house of your father (ancestor) when they were in Egypt in bondage to Pharaoh’s house? 28‘Moreover, I selected him out of all the tribes of Israel to be My priest, to go up to My altar, to burn incense, to wear an ephod before Me. And [from then on] I gave to the house of your father all the fire offerings of the sons of Israel. 29‘Why then do you kick at (despise) My sacrifice and My offering which I commanded in My dwelling place, and honor your sons more than Me, by fattening yourselves with the choicest part of every offering of My people Israel?’ 30Therefore the LORD God of Israel declares, ‘I did indeed say that your house and that of [Aaron] your father would walk [in priestly service] before Me forever.’ But now the LORD declares, ‘Far be it from Me—for those who honor Me I will honor, and those who despise Me will be insignificant and contemptible. 31‘Behold, the time is coming when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your father’s house, so that there will not be an old man in your house. 32‘You will look at the distress of My house (the tabernacle), in spite of all the good which God will do for Israel, and there will never again be an old man in your house. 33‘Yet I will not cut off every man of yours from My altar; your eyes will fail from weeping and your soul will grieve, and all those born in your house will die as men [in the prime of life]. 34‘This will be the sign to you which shall come concerning your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas: on the same day both of them shall die. 35‘But I will raise up for Myself a faithful priest who will do according to what is in My heart and in My soul; and I will build him a permanent and enduring house, and he will walk before My anointed forever. 36‘And it will happen that everyone who is left in your house will come and bow down to him for a piece of silver and a loaf of bread and say, “Please assign me to one of the priest’s offices so I may eat a piece of bread.”’”\n\n1 Samuel 3\nThe Prophetic Call To Samuel\n\n1Now the boy Samuel was attending to the service of the LORD under the supervision of Eli. The word of the LORD was rare and precious in those days; visions [that is, new revelations of divine truth] were not widespread.\n\n2Yet it happened at that time, as Eli was lying down in his own place (now his eyesight had begun to grow dim and he could not see well). 3and the [oil] lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying down in the temple of the LORD, where the ark of God was, 4that the LORD called Samuel, and he answered, “Here I am.” 5He ran to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli said, “I did not call you; lie down again.” So he went and lay down. 6Then the LORD called yet again, “Samuel!” So Samuel got up and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you called me.” But Eli answered, “I did not call, my son; lie down again.” 7Now Samuel did not yet know [or personally experience] the LORD, and the word of the LORD was not yet revealed [directly] to him. 8So the LORD called Samuel a third time. And he stood and went to Eli and said, “Here I am, for you did call me.” Then Eli understood that it was the LORD [who was] calling the boy. 9So Eli said to Samuel, “Go, lie down, and it shall be that if He calls you, you shall say, ‘Speak, LORD, for Your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.\n\n10Then the LORD came and stood and called as at the previous times, “Samuel! Samuel!” Then Samuel answered, “Speak, for Your servant is listening.” 11The LORD said to Samuel, “Behold, I am about to do a thing in Israel at which both ears of everyone who hears it will ring. 12On that day I will carry out against Eli everything that I have spoken concerning his house (family), from beginning to end. 13Now I have told him that I am about to judge his house forever for the sinful behavior which he knew [was happening], because his sons were bringing a curse on themselves [dishonoring and blaspheming God] and he did not rebuke them. 14“Therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli that the sinful behavior of Eli’s house (family) shall not be atoned for by sacrifice or offering forever.”\n\n15So Samuel lay down until morning. Then he opened the doors of the LORD’S house. But Samuel was afraid to tell the vision to Eli. 16But Eli called Samuel and said, “Samuel, my son.” And he answered, “Here I am.” 17Then Eli said, “What is it that He said to you? Please do not hide it from me. May God do the same to you, and more also, if you hide from me anything of all that He said to you.” 18So Samuel told him everything, hiding nothing from him. And Eli said, “It is the LORD; may He do what seems good to Him.”\n\n19Now Samuel grew; and the LORD was with him and He let none of his words fail [to be fulfilled]. 20And all Israel from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south] knew that Samuel was appointed as a prophet of the LORD. 21And the LORD continued to appear in Shiloh, for the LORD revealed Himself to Samuel in Shiloh by the word of the LORD.\n\n1 Samuel 4\nPhilistines Take The Ark In Victory\n\n1And the word of [the LORD through] Samuel came to all Israel. Now Israel went out to meet the Philistines in battle and they camped beside Ebenezer while the Philistines camped at Aphek. 2The Philistines assembled in battle formation to meet Israel, and when the battle was over, Israel was defeated by the Philistines, who killed about four thousand men on the battlefield. 3When the people (soldiers) came into the camp, the elders of Israel said, “Why has the LORD defeated us today before the Philistines? Let us bring the ark of the covenant of the LORD here from Shiloh, so that He may come among us and save us from the hand of our enemies.” 4So the people sent word to Shiloh, and from there they carried the ark of the covenant of the LORD of hosts who sits above the cherubim; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were with the ark of the covenant of God.\n\n5So it happened that as the ark of the covenant of the LORD came into the camp, all [the people of] Israel shouted with a great shout, and the earth resounded. 6When the Philistines heard the noise of the shout, they said, “What does the noise of this great shout in the camp of the Hebrews mean?” Then they understood that the ark of the LORD had come into the camp. 7The Philistines were afraid, for they said, “God has come into the camp.” And they said, “Woe [disaster is coming] to us! For nothing like this has happened before. 8Woe to us! Who will rescue us from the hand of these mighty gods? These are the gods who struck the Egyptians with all kinds of plagues in the wilderness. 9“Take courage, and be men, O Philistines, so that you do not become servants to the Hebrews, as they have been servants to you; act like men and fight!”\n\n10So the Philistines fought; Israel was defeated and every man fled to his tent. It was a very great defeat, for thirty thousand foot soldiers of Israel fell. 11Also the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were killed.\n\n12Now a man [from the tribe] of Benjamin ran from the battle line and came to Shiloh that same day with his clothes torn and dust on his head [as signs of mourning over the disaster]. 13When he arrived, Eli was sitting on his seat by the road, keeping watch, because his heart was anxious about the ark of God. When the man arrived to report [the news] in the city, everyone in the city cried out [to God, for help]. 14When Eli heard the noise of the outcry, he asked, “What is the noise of this uproar?” And the man came hurriedly and told Eli. 15Now Eli was ninety-eight years old; his eyes were dim so that he could not see. 16The man said to Eli, “I have come from the battle line. Indeed, I escaped from the battle line today.” Eli said, “How did things go, my son?” 17The messenger replied, “Israel has fled before the Philistines and there has also been a great slaughter among the people. Also your two sons, Hophni and Phinehas, are dead, and the ark of God has been taken.” 18When he mentioned the ark of God, Eli fell off the seat backwards by the side of the [city] gate. His neck was broken and he died, for he was old and heavy. He had judged Israel for forty years.\n\n19Now his daughter-in-law, Phinehas’ wife, was pregnant, and was about to give birth; so when she heard the news that the ark of God had been taken and that her father-in-law and her husband had died, she kneeled down and gave birth, because her [labor] pains began. 20And about the time of her death [following the sudden birth] the women attending her said to her, “Do not be afraid, for you have given birth to a son.” But she did not answer or pay any attention. 21And she named the boy Ichabod, saying, “The glory has left Israel,” because the ark of God had been taken and because of [the deaths of] her father-in-law and her husband. 22She said, “The glory has left Israel, for the ark of God has been taken.”\n\n1 Samuel 5\nCapture Of The Ark Provokes God\n\n1Then the Philistines took the ark of God, and they brought it from Ebenezer to Ashdod. 2They took the ark of God and brought it into the house of Dagon and set it beside [the image of] Dagon [their chief idol]. 3When the people of Ashdod got up early the next day, behold, Dagon had fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD. So they took Dagon and returned him to his place. 4But when they got up early the next morning, behold, Dagon had [again] fallen on his face on the ground before the ark of the LORD, and his head and both palms of his hands were [lying] cut off on the threshold; only the trunk [portion] of [the idol of] Dagon was left on him. 5This is the reason neither the priests of Dagon nor any who enter Dagon’s house step on the threshold of Dagon in Ashdod to this day.\n\n6Then the hand of the LORD was heavy on the people of Ashdod, and He caused them to be dumbfounded and struck them with tumors, both Ashdod and its territory. 7When the men of Ashdod saw what had happened, they said, “The ark of the God of Israel must not remain with us, for His hand is heavy on us and on Dagon our god.” 8So they sent word and gathered all the lords (governors) of the Philistines to them and said, “What shall we do with the ark of the God of Israel?” They answered, “Let the ark of the God of Israel be brought around to Gath.” So they took the ark of the God of Israel there. 9But it happened that after they had taken it to Gath, the hand of the LORD was against the city, causing an extremely great panic [because of the deaths from the plague], for He struck the people of the city, both young and old, and tumors broke out on them. 10So they sent the ark of God to Ekron. And as the ark of God came to Ekron, the Ekronites cried out, “They have brought the ark of the God of Israel [from Gath] to us, to kill us and our people.” 11So they sent word and gathered all the lords of the Philistines and said, “Send away the ark of the God of Israel; let it be returned to its own place, so that it will not kill us and our people.” For there was a deadly panic throughout the city; the hand of God was very heavy (severe) there. 12The men who had not died were stricken with tumors and the cry of the city [for help] went up to heaven.\n\n1 Samuel 6\nThe Ark Returned To Israel\n\n1Now the ark of the LORD had been in the country of the Philistines for seven months. 2And the Philistines called for the priests and the diviners (seers), saying, “What shall we do with the ark of the LORD? Let us know how we can send it back to its place.” 3They said, “If you send away the ark of the God of Israel, do not send it empty [without a gift]; but be sure to return [it] to Him [together with] a guilt offering. Then you will be healed, and it will be known to you why His hand is not removed from you.” 4Then they said, “What shall the guilt offering be which we shall return to Him?” They answered, “Five golden tumors and five golden mice, according to the number of the lords (governors) of the Philistines, for one plague was on all of you and on your lords. 5So you shall make replicas of your tumors and of your mice that ravage the land, and give glory to the God of Israel; perhaps He will lighten His hand [of judgment] on you and your gods and your land. 6Why then do you harden your hearts [allowing pride to cause your downfall] just as the Egyptians and Pharaoh hardened their hearts? When He had severely dealt with them and mocked them, did they not allow the people [of Israel] to go, and they departed? 7Now then, make a new cart and prepare two milk cows on which a yoke has never been placed; and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves back home, away from them. 8Then take the ark of the LORD and put it on the cart; and put the articles of gold which you are returning to Him as a guilt offering in a box beside it. Then send it away [without a driver]. 9“But watch, if it goes up by the way of its own territory to Beth-shemesh, then [you will know that] He has done us this great evil. But if not, then we will know that it was not His hand that struck us; this disaster happened to us by chance.”\n\n10And the men did so, and took two milk cows and hitched them to the cart, and corralled their calves at home. 11They put the ark of the LORD on the cart, and the box containing the golden mice and the replicas of their tumors. 12And the cows went straight toward Beth-shemesh along the highway, lowing as they went, and did not turn away to the right or the left. And the Philistine lords (governors) followed them to the border of Beth-shemesh.\n\n13Now the men of Beth-shemesh were gathering their wheat harvest in the valley, and they looked up and saw the ark and rejoiced to see it. 14The cart came into the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh and stopped there. A large stone was there; and the men split up the wood of the cart [for firewood] and offered the cows as a burnt offering to the LORD. 15The Levites had taken down the ark of the LORD and the box beside it, in which were the articles of gold, and put them on the large stone. And the men of Beth-shemesh offered burnt offerings and made sacrifices that day to the LORD. 16When the five lords of the Philistines saw what happened, they returned to Ekron that day.\n\n17These are the golden tumors which the Philistines returned as a guilt offering to the LORD: one for Ashdod, one for Gaza, one for Ashkelon, one for Gath and one for Ekron [the five chief cities of the Philistines]; 18also the golden mice, according to the number of all the cities of the Philistines belonging to the five lords, both fortified cities and [unwalled] country villages. The large stone on which the Levites set the ark of the LORD remains a witness to this day in the field of Joshua of Beth-shemesh.\n\n19The LORD struck down some of the men of Beth-shemesh because they had looked into the ark of the LORD. He struck down 50,070 men among the people, and the people mourned because the LORD had struck the people with a great slaughter. 20The men of Beth-shemesh said, “Who is able to stand before the LORD, this holy God? And to whom shall He go up from us?” 21So they sent messengers to the residents of Kiriath-jearim, saying, “The Philistines have returned the ark of the LORD. Come down and take it up to you.”\n\n1 Samuel 7\nRescue From The Philistines\n\n1So the men of Kiriath-jearim came and took up the ark of the Lord and brought it into the house of Abinadab on the hill, and they consecrated Eleazar his son to care for the ark of the Lord. 2And from that day the ark remained in Kiriath-jearim for a very long time, for it was twenty years [until the reign of King David]; and all the house of Israel lamented (wailed) and grieved after the LORD.\n\n3Then Samuel said to all the house of Israel, “If you are returning to the LORD with all your heart, remove the foreign gods and the Ashtaroth (pagan goddesses) from among you and direct your hearts to the LORD and serve Him only; and He will rescue you from the hand of the Philistines.” 4So the Israelites removed the Baals and the Ashtaroth and served the LORD alone.\n\n5Samuel said, “Gather all Israel together at Mizpah and I will pray to the LORD for you.” 6So they gathered at Mizpah, and drew water and poured it out before the LORD, and fasted on that day and said there, “We have sinned against the LORD.” And Samuel judged the Israelites at Mizpah.\n\n7Now when the Philistines heard that the Israelites had gathered at Mizpah, the lords (governors) of the Philistines went up against Israel. And when the Israelites heard it, they were afraid of the Philistines. 8And the sons of Israel said to Samuel, “Do not cease to cry out to the LORD our God for us, so that He may save us from the hand of the Philistines.” 9So Samuel took a nursing lamb and offered it as a whole burnt offering to the LORD; and Samuel cried out to the LORD for Israel and the LORD answered him. 10As Samuel was offering up the burnt offering, the Philistines approached for the battle against Israel. Then the LORD thundered with a great voice that day against the Philistines and threw them into confusion, and they were defeated and fled before Israel. 11And the men of Israel came out of Mizpah and pursued the Philistines, and struck them down as far as [the territory] below Beth-car.\n\n12Then Samuel took a stone and set it between Mizpah and Shen, and he named it Ebenezer (stone of help), saying, “Thus far the LORD has helped us.” 13So the Philistines were subdued and they did not come anymore into Israelite territory. And the hand of the LORD was against the Philistines all the days of Samuel. 14The cities which the Philistines had taken from Israel were restored to Israel, from Ekron to Gath; and Israel recovered the cities’ territory from the Philistines. Also there was peace between Israel and the Amorites.\n\nSamuel’s Ministry 15Now Samuel judged Israel all the days of his life. 16He used to go annually on a circuit to Bethel, Gilgal, and Mizpah, and he judged Israel in all these places. 17Then he would return to Ramah, because his home was there; and there he judged Israel, and there he built an altar to the LORD.\n\n1 Samuel 8\nIsrael Demands A King\n\n1And it came about when Samuel was old that he appointed his sons as judges over Israel. 2Now the name of his firstborn was Joel, and the name of his second, Abijah; they were judging in Beersheba. 3His sons, however, did not walk in his ways, but turned aside after dishonest gain, took bribes, and perverted justice.\n\n4Then all the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah 5and said to him, “Look, you have grown old, and your sons do not walk in your ways. Now appoint us a king to judge us [and rule over us] like all the other nations.” 6But their demand displeased Samuel when they said, “Give us a king to judge and rule over us.” So Samuel prayed to the LORD. 7The LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to the voice of the people in regard to all that they say to you, for they have not rejected you, but they have rejected Me from being King over them. 8Like all the deeds which they have done since the day that I brought them up from Egypt even to this day—in that they have abandoned (rejected) Me and served other gods—so they are doing to you also. 9“So now listen to their voice; only solemnly warn them and tell them the ways of the king who will reign over them.”\n\nWarning concerning a King 10So Samuel told all the words of the LORD to the people who were asking him for a king. 11He said, “These will be the ways of the king who will reign over you: he will take your sons and appoint them for himself to his chariots and among his horsemen and they will run before his chariots. 12He will appoint them for himself to be commanders over thousands and over fifties, and some to do his plowing and to reap his harvest and to make his implements of war and equipment for his chariots. 13He will take your daughters to be perfumers, cooks, and bakers. 14He will take the best of your fields, your vineyards, and your olive groves, and give them to his servants. 15He will take a tenth of your grain and of your vineyards and give it to his officers and to his servants. 16He will take your male servants and your female servants and your best young men and your donkeys and use them for his work. 17He will take a tenth of your flocks, and you yourselves shall be his servants. 18“Then you will cry out on that day because of your king whom you have chosen for yourselves, but the LORD will not answer you on that day [because you have rejected Him as King].”\n\n19Nevertheless, the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, “No, but there shall be a king over us, 20so that we too may be like all the nations [around us], that our king may judge [and govern] us and go out before us and fight our battles.” 21Samuel had heard all the words of the people and repeated them to the LORD. 22And the LORD said to Samuel, “Listen to their request and appoint a king for them.” So Samuel said to the men of Israel, “Go, each man to his own city.”\n\n1 Samuel 9\nSaul’s Search\n\n1There was a man of [the tribe of] Benjamin whose name was Kish the son of Abiel, the son of Zeror, the son of Becorath, the son of Aphiah, a Benjamite, a mighty man of influence and wealth. 2Kish had a son named Saul, a choice and handsome man; among the sons of Israel there was not a man more handsome than he. From his shoulders and up he was [a head] taller than any of the people.\n\n3Now the donkeys of Kish, Saul’s father, had wandered off and were lost. Kish said to his son Saul, “Please take one of the servants with you and arise, go look for the donkeys.” 4And they passed through the hill country of Ephraim and the land of Shalishah, but did not find them. Then they passed through the land of Shaalim, but they were not there and the land of the Benjamites, but they [still] did not find them.\n\n5When they came to the land of Zuph, Saul said to his servant who was with him, “Come, let us return, otherwise my father will stop worrying about the donkeys and become anxious about us.” 6The servant said to him, “Look here, in this city there is a man of God, and the man is held in honor; everything that he says comes true. Now let us go there; perhaps he can advise us about our journey [and tell us where we should go].” 7Then Saul said to his servant, “But look, if we go [to see him], what shall we bring to the man? For the bread from our sacks is gone and there is no gift to bring to the man of God. What do we have [to offer]?” 8The servant replied again to Saul, “Here in my hand I have a quarter of a shekel of silver; I will give that to the man of God, and he will advise us as to [where we should go on] our journey [to find the donkeys].” 9(Formerly in Israel, when a man went to inquire of God, he would say, “Come, let us go to the seer”; for he who is called a prophet today was formerly called a seer.) 10Saul said to his servant, “Well said; come, let us go.” So they went to the city where the man of God was living.\n\n11As they went up the hill to the city, they met some young women going out to draw water, and said to them, “Is the seer (prophet) here?” 12They answered them, “He is; look, he is ahead of you. Hurry now, for he has come into the city today because the people have a sacrifice on the high place today. 13“As you enter the city you will find him before he goes up to the high place to eat, for the people will not eat until he comes, because he must ask the blessing on the sacrifice; afterward, those who are invited will eat. So go up now, for about now you will find him.” 14So they went up to the city. And as they came into the city, there was Samuel coming out toward them to go up to the high place.\n\nGod’s Choice for King 15Now a day before Saul came, the LORD had informed Samuel [of this], saying, 16“About this time tomorrow I will send you a man from the land of Benjamin, and you shall anoint him as leader over My people Israel; and he will save My people from the hand of the Philistines. For I have looked upon [the distress of] My people, because their cry [for help] has come to Me.” 17When Samuel saw Saul, the LORD said to him, “There is the man of whom I spoke to you. This one shall rule over My people [as their king].” 18Then Saul approached Samuel in the [city] gate and said, “Please tell me where the seer’s house is.” 19Samuel answered Saul, “I am the seer. Go on ahead of me to the high place, for you shall eat with me today; and in the morning I will let you go, and will tell you all that is on your mind. 20“As for your donkeys which were lost three days ago, do not be concerned about them, for they have been found. And for whom are all things that are desirable in Israel? Are they not for you and for all your father’s household (family)?” 21Saul replied, “Am I not a Benjamite, of the smallest of the tribes of Israel? And is not my family the smallest of all the families of the tribe of Benjamin? Why then have you spoken this way to me [as if I were very important]?”\n\n22Then Samuel took Saul and his servant and brought them into the hall [at the high place] and gave them a place [to sit] at the head of the persons—about thirty men—who were invited [while the rest ate outside]. 23Samuel said to the cook, “Bring the [priests’] portion that I gave you, regarding which I told you, ‘Set it aside.’” 24Then the cook lifted up the leg (thigh) with the meat that was on it [indicating that it was the priest’s honored portion] and placed it before Saul. Samuel said, “Here is what has been reserved [for you]. Set it before you and eat, because it has been kept for you until the appointed time, ever since I invited the people.” So Saul ate with Samuel that day.\n\n25When they came down from the high place into the city, Samuel spoke with Saul on the roof [of his house]. 26They got up early [the next day]; and at dawn Samuel called Saul [who was sleeping] on the roof, saying, “Get up, so that I may send you on your way.” Saul got up, and both he and Samuel went outside. 27As they were going down to the outskirts of the city, Samuel said to Saul, “Tell the servant to go on ahead of us so that he may pass by but you stand still now so that I may proclaim the word of God to you.”\n\n1 Samuel 10\nSaul Among Prophets\n\n1Then Samuel took the flask of oil and poured it on Saul’s head, kissed him, and said, “Has the LORD not anointed you as ruler over His inheritance (Israel)? 2“When you leave me today, you will meet two men beside Rachel’s tomb in the territory of Benjamin at Zelzah; they will say to you, ‘The donkeys you went to look for have been found. And your father has stopped caring about them and is worried about you, saying, “What shall I do about my son?”’ 3Then you will go on further from there, and you will come to the terebinth tree of Tabor, and three men going up to [sacrifice to] God at Bethel will meet you there, one carrying three young goats, another carrying three loaves of bread, and another carrying a jug of wine. 4They will greet you and give you two loaves of bread, which you will accept from their hand. 5After that you will come to the hill of God where the garrison of the Philistines is; and when you come there to the city, you will meet a group of prophets coming down from the high place [of worship] with harp, tambourine, flute, and lyre before them, and they will be prophesying. 6Then the Spirit of the LORD will come upon you mightily, and you will prophesy with them, and you will be changed into another man. 7When these signs come to you, do for yourself whatever the situation requires, for God is with you. 8“You shall go down ahead of me to Gilgal; and behold, I will be coming down to you to offer burnt offerings and to sacrifice peace offerings. You shall wait seven days until I come to you and show you what you must do.”\n\n9Then it happened when Saul turned his back to leave Samuel, God changed his heart; and all those signs came to pass that day. 10When they came to the hill [Gibeah], behold, a group of prophets met him; and the Spirit of God came on him mightily, and he prophesied [under divine guidance] among them. 11Now when all who knew Saul previously saw that he actually prophesied now [by inspiration] with the prophets, the people said one to another, “What has happened to [Saul, who is nobody but] the son of Kish? Is Saul also among the prophets?” 12And a man from there answered, “But who is the father of the others?” So it became a proverb, “Is Saul also among the prophets?” 13When Saul had finished prophesying, he went to the high place [of worship].\n\n14Saul’s uncle said to him and to his servant, “Where did you go?” And Saul said, “To look for the donkeys. And when we saw that they were nowhere to be found, we went to Samuel [for help].” 15Saul’s uncle said, “Please tell me, what did Samuel say to you?” 16And Saul said to his uncle, “He told us plainly that the donkeys had been found.” But he did not tell him about the matter of the kingdom which Samuel had mentioned.\n\nSaul Publicly Chosen King 17Then Samuel called the people together to the LORD at Mizpah, 18and he said to Israel, “Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘It was I who brought Israel up from Egypt, and I rescued you from the hand of the Egyptians and from all the kingdoms that were oppressing you.’ 19“But today you have rejected your God, who Himself saves you from all your disasters and distresses; yet you have said, ‘No! Set a king over us.’ Now then, present yourselves before the LORD by your tribes and by your families (clans).”\n\n20And when Samuel brought all the tribes of Israel near, the tribe of Benjamin was chosen by lot. 21Then he brought the tribe of Benjamin near by their families, and the family of Matri was chosen by lot. And Saul the son of Kish was chosen by lot; but when they looked for him, he could not be found. 22So they inquired further of the LORD, “Has the man come here yet?” And the LORD answered, “He is there, hiding himself by the provisions and supplies.” 23So they ran and took him from there, and when he stood among the people, he was taller than any of the people from his shoulders upward. 24Samuel said to all the people, “Do you see him whom the LORD has chosen? For there is no one like him among all the people.” So all the people shouted and said, “Long live the king!”\n\n25Then Samuel told the people the requirements of the kingdom, and wrote them in a book and placed it before the LORD. And Samuel sent all the people away, each one to his home. 26Saul also went home to Gibeah; and the brave men whose hearts God had touched went with him. 27But some worthless men said, “How can this man save and rescue us?” And they regarded Saul with contempt and did not bring him a gift. But he ignored the insult and kept silent.\n\n1 Samuel 11\nSaul Defeats The Ammonites\n\n1Now Nahash the Ammonite [king] went up and besieged Jabesh-gilead; and all the men of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Make a treaty [of peace] with us and we will serve you.” 2But Nahash the Ammonite told them, “I will make a treaty with you on this condition, that I will gouge out the right eye of every one of you, and make it a disgrace upon all Israel.” 3The elders of Jabesh said to Nahash, “Give us seven days so that we may send messengers throughout the territory of Israel. Then, if there is no one to save us, we will come out [and surrender] to you.” 4Then the messengers came to Gibeah of Saul and told the news to the people; and all the people raised their voices and wept aloud.\n\n5Now Saul was coming out of the field behind the oxen, and he said, “What is the matter with the people that they are weeping?” So they told him about the report of the men of Jabesh. 6The Spirit of God came upon Saul mightily when he heard these words, and he became extremely angry. 7He took a team of oxen and cut them in pieces, and sent them throughout the territory of Israel by the hand of messengers, saying, “Whoever does not come out to follow Saul and Samuel, the same shall be done to his oxen.” Then fear of the LORD fell on the people, and they came out [united] as one man [with one purpose]. 8He assembled and counted them at Bezek; and the sons of Israel numbered 300,000, and the men of Judah 30,000. 9They said to the messengers who had come, “You shall say to the men of Jabesh-gilead: ‘Tomorrow, by the time the sun is hot, you will have help [against the Ammonites].’” So the messengers came and reported this to the men of Jabesh; and they were overjoyed. 10So the men of Jabesh said [to Nahash the Ammonite], “Tomorrow we will come out to you [to surrender], and you may do to us whatever seems good to you.” 11The next morning Saul put the men into three companies; and they entered the [Ammonites’] camp during the [darkness of the early] morning watch and killed the Ammonites until the heat of the day; and the survivors were scattered, and no two of them were left together.\n\n12The people said to Samuel, “Who is the one who said, ‘Shall Saul reign over us?’ Bring the men, and we will put them to death.” 13But Saul said, “No man shall be put to death this day, for today the LORD has brought victory to Israel.”\n\n14Samuel said to the people, “Come, let us go to Gilgal and there restore the kingdom.” 15So all the people went to Gilgal, and there they made Saul king before the LORD in Gilgal. There they also sacrificed peace offerings before the LORD; and there Saul and all the men of Israel rejoiced greatly.\n\n1 Samuel 12\nSamuel Addresses Israel\n\n1Then Samuel said to all Israel, “Behold, I have listened to your voice in everything that you have said to me and have appointed a king over you. 2And now, here is the king walking before you. As for me, I am old and gray, and here are my sons with you. I have walked before you from my childhood to this day. 3“Here I am; testify against me before the LORD and [Saul] His anointed [if I have done someone wrong]. Whose ox have I taken, or whose donkey have I taken, or whom have I exploited? Whom have I oppressed or from whose hand have I taken a bribe to blind my eyes [to the truth]? [Tell me and] I will restore it to you.” 4They said, “You have not exploited us or oppressed us or taken anything at all from a man’s hand.” 5Samuel said to them, “The LORD is a witness against you, and [Saul] His anointed is a witness this day that you have not found anything in my hand.” And they answered, “He is a witness.”\n\n6Then Samuel said to the people, “It is the LORD who appointed Moses and Aaron and brought your fathers (ancestors) up from the land of Egypt. 7Now then, take your stand, so that I may plead and contend with you before the LORD concerning all the righteous acts of the LORD which He did for you and for your fathers. 8When Jacob [and his sons] had come into Egypt [and later when the Egyptians oppressed them] and your fathers cried out to the LORD, then the LORD sent Moses and Aaron who brought your fathers out of Egypt and settled them in this place. 9But when they forgot the LORD their God, He sold them into the hand of Sisera, commander of Hazor’s army, and into the hand of the Philistines and of the king of Moab, and they fought against them. 10They cried out to the LORD, saying, ‘We have sinned because we have abandoned (rejected) the Lord and have served the Baals and the Ashtaroth; but now rescue us from the hands of our enemies, and we will serve You.’ 11Then the LORD sent Jerubbaal (Gideon) and Bedan and Jephthah and Samuel, and He rescued you from the hand of your enemies on every side, and you lived in security. The King Confirmed 12But when you saw that Nahash king of the Ammonites had come against you, you said to me, ‘No, but a king shall reign over us’—although the LORD your God was your King. 13Now therefore, here is [Saul] the king whom you have chosen, and for whom you asked; behold, the LORD has set a king over you. 14If you will fear the LORD [with awe and profound reverence] and serve Him and listen to His voice and not rebel against His commandment, then both you and your king will follow the LORD your God [and it will be well]. 15But if you do not listen to the LORD’S voice, but rebel against His command, then the hand of the LORD will be against you [to punish you], as it was against your fathers. 16So now, take your stand and see this great thing which the LORD will do before your eyes. 17“Is it not [the beginning of the] wheat harvest today? I will call to the LORD and He will send thunder and rain; then you will know [without any doubt], and see that your evil which you have done is great in the sight of the LORD by asking for yourselves a king.” 18So Samuel called to the LORD [in prayer], and He sent thunder and rain that day; and all the people greatly feared the LORD and Samuel.\n\n19Then all the people said to Samuel, “Pray to the LORD your God for your servants, so that we will not die, for we have added to all our sins this evil—to ask for a king for ourselves.” 20Samuel said to the people, “Do not be afraid. You have [indeed] done all this evil; yet do not turn away from following the LORD, but serve the LORD with all your heart. 21You must not turn away, for then you would go after futile things which cannot profit or rescue, because they are futile. 22The LORD will not abandon His people for His great name’s sake, because the LORD has been pleased to make you a people for Himself. 23Moreover, as for me, far be it from me that I should sin against the LORD by ceasing to pray for you; but I will instruct you in the good and right way. 24Only fear the LORD [with awe and profound reverence] and serve Him faithfully with all your heart; for consider what great things He has done for you. 25“But if you still do evil, both you and your king will be swept away [to destruction].”\n\n1 Samuel 13\nWar With The Philistines\n\n1Saul was thirty years old when he began to reign, and he reigned forty-two years over Israel.\n\n2Saul chose for himself 3,000 men of Israel; of whom 2,000 were with him in Michmash and in the hill country of Bethel, while 1,000 were with Jonathan at Gibeah of Benjamin. But he sent the rest of the people away, each one to his own tent. 3Jonathan attacked and defeated the Philistine garrison which was at Geba, and the Philistines heard about it. Then Saul blew the trumpet throughout the land, saying, “Let the Hebrews hear.” 4All Israel heard that Saul had defeated the Philistine garrison, and also that Israel had become despicable to the Philistines. And the people were summoned to join Saul at Gilgal.\n\n5Now the Philistines gathered to fight against Israel, 30,000 chariots and 6,000 horsemen, and troops in multitude, like sand on the seashore. They came up and camped at Michmash, east of Beth-aven. 6When the men of Israel saw that they were in a tight situation (for their troops were hard-pressed), they hid in caves, in thickets, in cellars, and in [dry] cisterns (pits). 7Also some of the Hebrews had crossed the [river] Jordan to the land of Gad and Gilead. As for Saul, he was still in Gilgal, and all the people followed him, trembling [in fear and anticipation].\n\n8Now Saul waited seven days, according to the appointed time which Samuel had set, but Samuel had not come to Gilgal; and the people were scattering away from Saul. 9So Saul said, “Bring me the burnt offering and the peace offerings.” And he offered the burnt offering [which he was forbidden to do]. 10As soon as he finished offering the burnt offering, Samuel finally came; Saul went out to meet and to welcome him. 11But Samuel said, “What have you done?” Saul said, “Since I saw that the people were scattering away from me, and that you did not come within the appointed time, and that the Philistines were assembling at Michmash, 12therefore, I said, ‘Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal, and I have not asked for the LORD’S favor [by making supplication to Him].’ So I forced myself to offer the burnt offering.” 13Samuel said to Saul, “You have acted foolishly; you have not kept the commandment of the LORD your God, which He commanded you, for [if you had obeyed] the LORD would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. 14“But now your kingdom shall not endure. The LORD has sought out for Himself a man (David) after His own heart, and the LORD has appointed him as leader and ruler over His people, because you have not kept (obeyed) what the LORD commanded you.”\n\n15Then Samuel arose and went up from Gilgal to Gibeah of Benjamin. And Saul assembled and counted the people who were still with him, [only] about six hundred [fighting] men. 16Saul and his son Jonathan and the people with them were staying in Geba of Benjamin, while the Philistines camped at Michmash. 17And the raiding party came from the Philistine camp in three companies: one company turned toward Ophrah, to the land of Shual, 18another company turned toward Beth-horon, and another toward the border overlooking the Valley of Zeboim toward the wilderness.\n\n19Now no blacksmith (metal-worker) could be found in all the land of Israel, for the Philistines said, “Otherwise the Hebrews will make swords or spears.” 20So all [the men of] Israel went down to the Philistines, each to get his plowshare, pick, axe, or sickle sharpened. 21The fee [for sharpening] was a pim (two-thirds of a shekel) for the plowshares, the picks, the pitchforks, and the axes, and to straighten the goads (cattle prods). 22So it came about on the day of battle that neither sword nor spear was found in the hands of any of the people who were with Saul and Jonathan; but Saul and Jonathan his son had them. 23And the garrison of the Philistines went out to the pass at Michmash.\n\n1 Samuel 14\nJonathan’s Victory\n\n1One day Jonathan the son of Saul said to his young armor bearer, “Come, let us go over to the Philistine garrison on the other side.” But he did not tell his father. 2Saul was staying in the outskirts of Gibeah under a pomegranate tree in Migron; and with him were about six hundred men, 3and Ahijah the son of Ichabod’s brother Ahitub the son of Phinehas, the son of Eli, the LORD’S priest at Shiloh, was wearing the ephod. And the people did not know that Jonathan had gone. 4Between the passes by which Jonathan sought to cross over to get to the Philistine garrison, there was a rocky crag on the one side and a rocky crag on the other side; one [crag] was named Bozez, and the other, Seneh. 5The one crag was on the north in front of Michmash, and the other on the south in front of Geba.\n\n6Jonathan said to his young armor bearer, “Come, let us cross over to the garrison of these uncircumcised men; it may be that the LORD will work for us. For there is nothing to prevent the LORD from saving, whether by many or by few.” 7And his armor bearer said to him, “Do everything that is in your heart (mind); here I am with you in whatever you think [best].” 8Jonathan said, “See now, we are going to cross over to the [Philistine] men and reveal ourselves to them. 9If they say to us, ‘Wait until we come to you,’ then we will stand in our place and not go up to them. 10“But if they say, ‘Come up to us,’ we will go up, for the LORD has handed them over to us; and this shall be the sign to us.” 11When both of them revealed themselves to the garrison of the Philistines, the Philistines said, “Look, the Hebrews are coming out of the holes where they have hidden themselves.” 12So the men of the garrison responded to Jonathan and his armor bearer, “Come up to us and we will tell you something.” Jonathan said to his armor bearer, “Climb up after me, for the LORD has given them into the hands of Israel.” 13Then Jonathan climbed up on his hands and feet, his armor bearer following after him. The enemy fell before Jonathan [in combat], and his armor bearer killed some of them after him. 14That first slaughter which Jonathan and his armor bearer made was about twenty men within about half a [plow] furrow in a plot of land [the area of which a yoke of oxen could plow in a day]. 15And there was trembling in the [Philistine] camp, in the field, and among all the people; even the garrison and the raiding party trembled [in fear], and the earth quaked and it became a trembling and terror from God.\n\n16Saul’s watchmen in Gibeah of Benjamin looked, and behold, the multitude melted away and they went here and there. 17Then Saul said to the people with him, “Take a count and see who has left us.” When they had taken a count, behold, Jonathan and his armor bearer were missing. 18Saul said to Ahijah [the priest], “Bring the ark of God here.” For at that time the ark of God was with the sons of Israel. 19While Saul talked to the priest, the commotion in the Philistine camp continued and increased, so Saul said to the priest, “Withdraw your hand.” 20Then Saul and all the people who were with him rallied and went into the battle; and behold, every [Philistine] man’s sword was against his companion, in wild confusion. 21Now the Hebrews who were with the Philistines previously, who went up with them all around in the camp, they also turned to be with the Israelites who were with Saul and Jonathan. 22When all the men of Israel who had hidden themselves in the hill country of Ephraim heard that the Philistines had fled, they too pursued them closely in the battle. 23So the LORD saved Israel that day, and the battle spread beyond Beth-aven.\n\nSaul’s Foolish Order 24But the men of Israel were hard-pressed that day, because Saul had put the people under a curse, saying, “Cursed be the man who eats food before evening, and before I have taken vengeance on my enemies.” So none of the people ate any food. 25All the people of the land came to a forest, and there was honey on the ground. 26When the people entered the forest, the honey was dripping, but no man put his hand to his mouth [to taste it], because the people feared the oath [of Saul]. 27But Jonathan had not heard when his father put the people under the oath. So he put out the end of the staff that was in his hand and dipped it into a honeycomb, and then he put his hand to his mouth, and his energy was restored. 28But one of the people told him, “Your father strictly put the people under an oath, saying, ‘Cursed be the man who eats food today.’” And the people were exhausted [and hungry]. 29Then Jonathan said, “My father has troubled the land [with his foolish curse]. See how my energy is restored because I tasted a little of this honey. 30How much better [it would have been] if only the people had eaten freely today from the spoil of their enemies which they found! For now the slaughter among the Philistines has not been great.”\n\n31They struck the Philistines that day from Michmash to Aijalon. And the people were very tired. 32[When night came and the oath ended] the people rushed greedily upon the spoil. They took sheep, oxen, and calves, and slaughtered them on the ground; and they ate them [raw] with the blood [still in them]. 33Then Saul was told, “Look, the people are sinning against the LORD by eating [the meat] with the blood.” And he said, “You have violated [the Law] and acted treacherously; roll a large stone to me today.” 34Saul said, “Spread out among the people and tell them, ‘Each one of you bring me his ox or his sheep, and butcher it [properly] here and eat; and do not sin against the LORD by eating [the meat with] the blood.’” So that night each one brought his ox with him and butchered it there. 35And Saul built an altar to the LORD; it was the first altar that he built to the LORD.\n\n36Then Saul said, “Let us go down after the Philistines by night and plunder them until the morning light, and let us not leave a man of them [alive].” They said, “Do whatever seems good to you.” Then the priest said, “Let us approach God here.” 37Saul asked [counsel] of God, “Shall I go down after the Philistines? Will You hand them over to Israel?” But He did not answer him that day. 38Then Saul said, “Come here, all you who are leaders of the people, and let us find out how this sin [causing God’s silence] happened today. 39“For as the LORD lives, who saves Israel, for even if the guilt is in my son Jonathan, he shall most certainly die.” But not one of all the people answered him. 40Then he said to all the Israelites, “You shall be on one side; I and my son Jonathan will be on the other side.” The people said to Saul, “Do what seems good to you.” 41Therefore, Saul said to the LORD, the God of Israel, “Give a perfect lot [identifying the transgressor].” Then Saul and Jonathan were selected [by lot], but the other men went free. 42Saul said, “Cast [lots] between me and my son Jonathan.” And Jonathan was selected.\n\n43Saul said to Jonathan, “Tell me what you have done.” So Jonathan told him, “I tasted a little honey with the end of the staff that was in my hand. Here I am, I must die!” 44Saul answered, “May God do so [to me], and more also [if I do not keep my word], for you shall most certainly die, Jonathan.” 45But the people said to Saul, “Must Jonathan, who has brought about this great victory in Israel, be put to death? Far from it! As the LORD lives, not one hair of his head shall fall to the ground, for he has worked with God this day.” So the people rescued Jonathan and he was not put to death. 46Then Saul stopped pursuing the Philistines, and the Philistines went to their own place.\n\nConstant Warfare 47When Saul assumed control of the kingdom of Israel, he fought against all his enemies on every side: Moab, the sons (descendants) of Ammon, Edom, the kings of Zobah, and the Philistines. Wherever he turned, he inflicted punishment. 48He acted valiantly and defeated the Amalekites, and rescued Israel from the hands of those who had plundered them.\n\n49Now Saul’s sons were Jonathan, Ishvi, and Malchi-shua. The names of his two daughters were these: the name of the firstborn was Merab, and the name of the younger, Michal. 50The name of Saul’s wife was Ahinoam the daughter of Ahimaaz. The commander of his army was named Abner, the son of Ner, Saul’s uncle. 51Kish was the father of Saul, and Ner the father of Abner was the son of Abiel.\n\n52Now the war against the Philistines was severe (brutal, relentless) all the days of Saul; and whenever Saul saw any mighty or courageous man, he recruited him for his staff.\n\n1 Samuel 15\nSaul’s Disobedience\n\n1Samuel said to Saul, “The Lord sent me to anoint you king over His people Israel. Now listen and pay close attention to the words of the Lord. 2Thus says the LORD of hosts (armies), ‘I will punish Amalek for what he did to Israel, how he set himself against him on the way when Israel came up from Egypt. 3‘Now go and strike Amalek and completely destroy everything that they have; do not spare them, but kill both man and woman, child and infant, ox and sheep, camel and donkey.’”\n\n4So Saul summoned the people and numbered them at Telaim—200,000 foot soldiers and 10,000 men of Judah. 5Saul came to the city of Amalek and set an ambush in the valley. 6Saul said to the Kenites, “Go, leave, go down from the Amalekites, so that I do not destroy you along with them; for you showed kindness to all the Israelites when they went up from Egypt.” So the Kenites departed from among the Amalekites. 7Saul defeated the Amalekites, from Havilah as far as Shur, which is east of Egypt. 8He captured Agag the king of the Amalekites alive, though he totally destroyed all [the rest of] the people with the sword. 9Saul and the people spared Agag and the best of the sheep, the oxen, the fatlings, the lambs, and everything that was good, and they were not willing to destroy them entirely; but everything that was undesirable or worthless they destroyed completely.\n\nSamuel Rebukes Saul 10Then the word of the LORD came to Samuel, saying, 11“I regret that I made Saul king, for he has turned away from following Me and has not carried out My commands.” Samuel was angry [over Saul’s failure] and he cried out to the LORD all night. 12When Samuel got up early in the morning to meet Saul, he was told, “Saul came to Carmel, and behold, he set up for himself a monument [commemorating his victory], then he turned and went on and went down to Gilgal.” 13So Samuel came to Saul, and Saul said to him, “Blessed are you of the LORD. I have carried out the command of the LORD.” 14But Samuel said, “What then is this bleating of the sheep in my ears, and the lowing of the oxen which I hear?” 15Saul said, “They have brought them from the Amalekites, for the people spared the best of the sheep and oxen to sacrifice to the LORD your God; but the rest we have destroyed completely.” 16Then Samuel said to Saul, “Stop, and let me tell you what the LORD said to me last night.” Saul said to him, “Speak.”\n\n17Samuel said, “Is it not true that even though you were small (insignificant) in your own eyes, you were made the head of the tribes of Israel? And the LORD anointed you king over Israel, 18and the LORD sent you on a mission, and said, ‘Go, totally destroy the sinners, the Amalekites, and fight against them until they are eliminated.’ 19“Why did you not obey the voice of the LORD, but [instead] swooped down on the plunder [with shouts of victory] and did evil in the sight of the LORD?”\n\n20Saul said to Samuel, “I have obeyed the voice of the LORD, and have gone on the mission on which the LORD sent me, and have brought back Agag the king of Amalek, and have completely destroyed the Amalekites. 21“But the people took some of the spoil, sheep and oxen, the best of the things [that were] to be totally destroyed, to sacrifice to the LORD your God at Gilgal.” 22Samuel said,\n“Has the LORD as great a delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices\nAs in obedience to the voice of the LORD?\nBehold, to obey is better than sacrifice,\nAnd to heed [is better] than the fat of rams.\n23“For rebellion is as [serious as] the sin of divination (fortune-telling),\nAnd disobedience is as [serious as] false religion and idolatry.\nBecause you have rejected the word of the LORD,\nHe also has rejected you as king.”\n\n24Then Saul said to Samuel, “I have sinned; for I have transgressed the command of the LORD and your words, because I feared the people and obeyed their voice. 25“Now, please, pardon my sin and return with me, so that I may worship the LORD.” 26But Samuel said to Saul, “I will not return with you; for you have rejected the word of the LORD, and the LORD has rejected you from being king over Israel.” 27As Samuel turned to go [away], Saul grabbed the hem of his robe [to stop him], and it tore. 28So Samuel said to him, “The LORD has torn the kingdom of Israel from you today and has given it to your neighbor, who is better than you. 29“Also the Splendor and Glory and Eminence of Israel will not lie or change His mind; for He is not a man that He should change His mind.” 30Saul said, “I have sinned; but please honor me now before the elders of my people and before Israel, and go back with me, so that I may worship the LORD your God.” 31So Samuel went back following Saul, and Saul worshiped the LORD.\n\n32Then Samuel said, “Bring me Agag, the king of the Amalekites.” And Agag came to him cheerfully. And Agag said, “Surely the bitterness of death has come to an end.” 33Samuel said, “As your sword has made women childless, so shall your mother be childless among women.” And Samuel cut Agag in pieces before the LORD in Gilgal.\n\n34Then Samuel went to Ramah, but Saul went up to his house in Gibeah of Saul. 35Samuel did not see Saul again until the day of his death, for Samuel grieved over Saul. And the LORD regretted that He had made Saul king over Israel.\n\n1 Samuel 16\nSamuel Goes To Bethlehem\n\n1The LORD said to Samuel, “How long will you grieve for Saul, when I have rejected him as king over Israel? Fill your horn with oil and go; I will send you to Jesse the Bethlehemite, for I have chosen a king for Myself among his sons.” 2But Samuel said, “How can I go? When Saul hears about it, he will kill me.” And the LORD said, “Take a heifer from the herd with you and say, ‘I have come to sacrifice to the Lord.’ 3“You shall invite Jesse to the sacrifice, and I will show you what you shall do [after that]; and you shall anoint for Me the one whom I designate.” 4So Samuel did what the LORD said, and came to Bethlehem. And the elders of the city came trembling to meet him and said, “Do you come in peace?” 5And he said, “In peace; I have come to sacrifice to the LORD. Consecrate yourselves and come with me to the sacrifice.” He also consecrated Jesse and his sons and invited them to the sacrifice.\n\n6So it happened, when they had come, he looked at Eliab [the eldest son] and thought, “Surely the LORD’S anointed is before Him.” 7But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not look at his appearance or at the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the LORD sees not as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” 8Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass before Samuel. But Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” 9Next Jesse had Shammah pass by. And Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen him either.” 10Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel. But Samuel said to Jesse, “The LORD has not chosen [any of] these.” 11Then Samuel said to Jesse, “Are all your sons here?” Jesse replied, “There is still one left, the youngest; he is tending the sheep.” Samuel said to Jesse, “Send word and bring him; because we will not sit down [to eat the sacrificial meal] until he comes here.” David Anointed 12So Jesse sent word and brought him in. Now he had a ruddy complexion, with beautiful eyes and a handsome appearance. The LORD said [to Samuel], “Arise, anoint him; for this is he.” 13Then Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed David in the presence of his brothers; and the Spirit of the LORD came mightily upon David from that day forward. And Samuel arose and went to Ramah.\n\n14Now the Spirit of the LORD departed from Saul, and an evil spirit from the Lord tormented and terrified him. 15Saul’s servants said to him, “Behold, an evil spirit from God is tormenting you. 16“Let our lord now command your servants who are here before you to find a man who plays skillfully on the harp; and when the evil spirit from God is on you, he shall play the harp with his hand, and you will be well.” 17So Saul told his servants, “Find me a man who plays well and bring him to me.” 18One of the young men said, “Behold, I have seen a son of Jesse the Bethlehemite who is a skillful musician, a brave and competent man, a warrior, discerning (prudent, eloquent) in speech, and a handsome man; and the LORD is with him.” 19So Saul sent messengers to Jesse and said, “Send me David your son, who is with the flock.” 20Jesse took a donkey [loaded with] bread and a jug of wine and a young goat, and sent them to Saul with David his son. 21Then David came to Saul and attended him. Saul loved him greatly and [later] David became his armor bearer. 22Saul sent word to Jesse, saying, “Please let David be my attendant, for he has found favor in my sight.” 23So it came about that whenever the [evil] spirit from God was on Saul, David took a harp and played it with his hand; so Saul would be refreshed and be well, and the evil spirit would leave him.\n\n1 Samuel 17\nGoliath’s Challenge\n\n1Now the Philistines gathered their armies for battle and were assembled at Socoh, which belongs to Judah; and they camped between Socoh and Azekah, in Ephes-dammim. 2Saul and the men of Israel were gathered together and they camped in the Valley of Elah, and assembled in battle formation to meet the Philistines. 3The Philistines were standing on the mountain on one side and Israel was standing on the mountain on the other side, with the valley between them. 4Then a champion came out from the camp of the Philistines named Goliath of Gath, whose height was six cubits and a span. 5He had a bronze helmet on his head, and wore a coat of scale-armor (overlapping metal plates) which weighed 5,000 shekels of bronze. 6He had bronze shin protectors on his legs and a bronze javelin hung between his shoulders. 7The [wooden] shaft of his spear was like a weaver’s beam; the blade-head of his spear weighed six hundred shekels of iron. And a shield-bearer walked in front of him. 8Goliath stood and shouted to the battle lines of Israel, saying to them, “Why have you come out to draw up for battle? Am I not the Philistine and are you not servants of Saul? Choose a man for yourselves and have him come down to me. 9“If he is able to fight with me and kill me, then we will become your servants; but if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall become our servants and serve us.” 10Again the Philistine said, “I defy the battle lines of Israel this day; give me a man so that we may fight together.” 11When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid.\n\n12Now David was the son of the Ephrathite of Bethlehem in Judah, named Jesse, who had eight sons. Jesse was old in the days of Saul, advanced in years among men. 13His three older sons had followed Saul into battle. The names of his three sons who went to battle were Eliab, the firstborn; next, Abinadab; and third, Shammah. 14David was the youngest. Now the three oldest followed Saul, 15but David went back and forth from Saul to tend his father’s flock at Bethlehem. 16The Philistine [Goliath] came out morning and evening, and took his stand for forty days.\n\n17Then Jesse said to David his son, “Take for your brothers an ephah of this roasted grain and these ten loaves of bread and run quickly to the camp to your brothers. 18Also take these ten cuts of cheese to the commander of the unit. See how your brothers are doing and bring back news of them. 19“Now they are with Saul and all the men of Israel in the Valley of Elah, fighting with the Philistines.”\n\nDavid Accepts the Challenge 20So David got up early in the morning, left the flock with a keeper, picked up the provisions and went just as Jesse had directed him. And he came to the encampment as the army was going out in battle formation shouting the battle cry. 21Israel and the Philistines drew up in battle formation, army against army. 22Then David left his provisions in the care of the supply keeper, and ran to the ranks and came and greeted his brothers. 23As he was talking with them, behold, the champion, the Philistine of Gath named Goliath, was coming up from the army of the Philistines, and he spoke these same words again; and David heard him.\n\n24When the men of Israel all saw the man, they fled from him, and were very frightened. 25The men of Israel said, “Have you seen this man who is coming up? Surely he is coming up to defy Israel. The king will reward the man who kills him with great riches, and will give him his daughter [in marriage] and make his father’s house (family) free [from taxes and service] in Israel.”\n\n26Then David spoke to the men who were standing by him, “What will be done for the man who kills this Philistine and removes the disgrace [of his taunting] from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine that he has taunted and defied the armies of the living God?” 27The men told him, “That is what will be done for the man who kills him.”\n\n28Now Eliab his oldest brother heard what he said to the men; and Eliab’s anger burned against David and he said, “Why have you come down here? With whom did you leave those few sheep in the wilderness? I know your presumption (overconfidence) and the evil of your heart; for you have come down in order to see the battle.” 29But David said, “What have I done now? Was it not just a [harmless] question?” 30Then David turned away from Eliab to someone else and asked the same question; and the people gave him the same answer as the first time.\n\nDavid Kills Goliath 31When the words that David spoke were heard, the men reported them to Saul, and he sent for him. 32David said to Saul, “Let no man’s courage fail because of him (Goliath). Your servant will go out and fight with this Philistine.” 33Then Saul said to David, “You are not able to go against this Philistine to fight him. For you are [only] a young man and he has been a warrior since his youth.” 34But David said to Saul, “Your servant was tending his father’s sheep. When a lion or a bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, 35I went out after it and attacked it and rescued the lamb from its mouth; and when it rose up against me, I seized it by its whiskers and struck and killed it. 36“Your servant has killed both the lion and the bear; and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, since he has taunted and defied the armies of the living God.” 37David said, “The LORD who rescued me from the paw of the lion and from the paw of the bear, He will rescue me from the hand of this Philistine.” And Saul said to David, “Go, and may the LORD be with you.” 38Then Saul dressed David in his garments and put a bronze helmet on his head, and put a coat of mail (armor) on him. 39Then David fastened his sword over his armor and tried to walk, [but he could not,] because he was not used to them. And David said to Saul, “I cannot go with these, because I am not used to them.” So David took them off. 40Then he took his [shepherd’s] staff in his hand and chose for himself five smooth stones out of the stream bed, and put them in his shepherd’s bag which he had, that is, in his shepherd’s pouch. With his sling in his hand, he approached the Philistine.\n\n41The Philistine came and approached David, with his shield-bearer in front of him. 42When the Philistine looked around and saw David, he derided and disparaged him because he was [just] a young man, with a ruddy complexion, and a handsome appearance. 43The Philistine said to David, “Am I a dog, that you come to me with [shepherd’s] staffs?” And the Philistine cursed David by his gods. 44The Philistine also said to David, “Come to me, and I will give your flesh to the birds of the sky and the beasts of the field.” 45Then David said to the Philistine, “You come to me with a sword, a spear, and a javelin, but I come to you in the name of the LORD of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have taunted. 46This day the LORD will hand you over to me, and I will strike you down and cut off your head. And I will give the corpses of the army of the Philistines this day to the birds of the sky and the wild beasts of the earth, so that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel, 47and that this entire assembly may know that the LORD does not save with the sword or with the spear; for the battle is the LORD’S and He will hand you over to us.”\n\n48When the Philistine rose and came forward to meet David, David ran quickly toward the battle line to meet the Philistine. 49David put his hand into his bag and took out a stone and slung it, and it struck the Philistine on his forehead. The stone penetrated his forehead, and he fell face down on the ground.\n\n50So David triumphed over the Philistine with a sling and a stone, and he struck down the Philistine and killed him; but there was no sword in David’s hand. 51So he ran and stood over the Philistine, grasped his sword and drew it out of its sheath and killed him, and cut off his head with it. When the Philistines saw that their [mighty] champion was dead, they fled. 52The men of Israel and Judah stood with a shout and pursued the Philistines as far as the entrance to the valley and the gates of Ekron. And the [fatally] wounded Philistines fell along the way to Shaaraim, even as far as Gath and Ekron. 53The sons of Israel returned from their pursuit of the Philistines and plundered their camp. 54Then David took the head of the Philistine and brought it to Jerusalem, but he put his weapons in his tent.\n\n55When Saul saw David going out against the Philistine, he said to Abner the captain of the army, “Abner, whose son is this young man?” And Abner answered, “By your life, O king, I do not know.” 56The king said, “Ask whose son the young man is.” 57When David returned from killing [Goliath] the Philistine, Abner took him and brought him before Saul with the head of the Philistine in his hand. 58Saul asked him, “Whose son are you, young man?” And David answered, “I am the son of your servant Jesse of Bethlehem.”\n\n1 Samuel 18\nJonathan And David\n\n1When David had finished speaking to Saul, the soul of Jonathan was bonded to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as himself. 2Saul took David that day and did not let him return to his father’s house. 3Then Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as himself. 4Jonathan stripped himself of the outer robe that he was wearing and gave it to David, with his armor, including his sword, his bow, and his belt. 5So David went out wherever Saul sent him, and he acted wisely and prospered; and Saul appointed him over the men of war. And it pleased all the people and also Saul’s servants.\n\n6As they were coming [home], when David returned from killing the Philistine, the women came out of all the cities of Israel, singing and dancing, to meet King Saul with tambourines, [songs of] joy, and musical instruments. 7The women sang as they played and danced, saying,\n“Saul has slain his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands.”\n\n8Then Saul became very angry, for this saying displeased him; and he said, “They have ascribed to David ten thousands, but to me they have ascribed [only] thousands. Now what more can he have but the kingdom?” 9Saul looked at David with suspicion [and jealously] from that day forward.\n\nSaul Turns against David 10Now it came about on the next day that an evil spirit from God came forcefully on Saul, and he raved [madly] inside his house, while David was playing the harp with his hand, as usual; and there was a spear in Saul’s hand. 11Saul hurled the spear, for he thought, “I will pin David to the wall.” But David evaded him twice.\n\n12Now Saul was afraid of David, because the LORD was with him, but had departed from Saul. 13So Saul had David removed from his presence and appointed him as his commander of a thousand; and he publicly associated with the people. 14David acted wisely and prospered in all his ways, and the LORD was with him. 15When Saul saw that he was prospering greatly, he was afraid of him. 16But all Israel and Judah loved David, because he publicly associated with them.\n\n17Then Saul said to David, “Behold I will give you my older daughter Merab as a wife; only be brave for me and fight the LORD’S battles.” For Saul thought, “My hand shall not be against him, but let the hand of the Philistines be against him.” 18David said to Saul, “Who am I, and what is my life or my father’s family in Israel, that I should be the king’s son-in-law?” 19But at the time when Merab, Saul’s daughter, should have been given to David, she was [instead] given to Adriel the Meholathite as a wife.\n\nDavid Marries Saul’s Daughter 20Now Michal, Saul’s daughter, loved David; and when they told Saul, it pleased him. 21Saul said, “I will give her to him so that she may become a snare (bad influence, source of trouble) to him, and that the hand of the Philistines may be against him.” So Saul said to David for a second time, “You shall be my son-in-law today.” 22Then Saul commanded his servants, “Speak to David secretly, saying, ‘Listen, the king delights in you, and all his servants love you; now then, become the king’s son-in-law.’” 23So Saul’s servants spoke these words to David. But David said, “Is it a trivial thing in your sight to become a king’s son-in-law, seeing that I am a poor man and insignificant?” 24The servants of Saul told him what David said. 25Then Saul said, “This is what you shall say to David: ‘The king wants no dowry except a hundred foreskins of the Philistines, to take vengeance on the king’s enemies.’” Now Saul’s intention was to cause David’s death at the hand of the Philistines. 26When his servants told David these words, it pleased him to become the king’s son-in-law. Before the time [for the marriage] arrived, 27David arose and went, he and his men, and killed two hundred Philistine men, and David brought their foreskins [as proof of death] and presented every one of them to the king, so that he might become the king’s son-in-law. So Saul gave him Michal, his [younger] daughter, as a wife. 28When Saul saw and knew that the LORD was with David, and that Michal, his daughter, loved him, 29Saul was even more afraid of David; and Saul became David’s constant enemy.\n\n30Then the Philistine commanders (princes) came out to battle, and it happened as often as they did, that David acted more wisely and had more success than all Saul’s servants. So his name was highly esteemed.\n\n1 Samuel 19\nDavid Protected From Saul\n\n1Now Saul told his son Jonathan and all his servants to kill David, but Jonathan, Saul’s son, greatly delighted in David. 2So he told David, “Saul my father is seeking to kill you. Now then, please be on guard in the morning, and stay in a secret place and hide yourself. 3“As for me, I will go out and stand beside my father in the field where you are, and I will speak with my father about you, and if I learn anything, then I will tell you.” 4Then Jonathan spoke well of David to Saul his father and said to him, “May the king not sin against his servant David, since he has not sinned against you, and since his deeds have been very beneficial to you. 5“For he took his life in his hand and killed the Philistine, and the LORD brought about a great victory for all Israel; you saw it and rejoiced. Why then would you sin against innocent blood by killing David without a cause?” 6Saul listened to Jonathan and swore [an oath], “As the LORD lives, he shall not be put to death.” 7So Jonathan called David and told him all these things. And Jonathan brought David to Saul, and he was in his presence [serving him] as previously.\n\n8Then there was war again, and David went out and fought with the Philistines and defeated them with a great slaughter, and they fled before him. 9Then an evil spirit from the LORD came on Saul as he was sitting in his house with his spear in his hand, and David was playing the harp with his hand. 10Saul tried to pin David to the wall with the spear, but he escaped from Saul’s presence, so that Saul only stuck the spear into the wall. Then David fled and escaped that night.\n\n11Then Saul sent messengers to David’s house to watch for him, so that he might kill him in the morning. But Michal, David’s wife, told him, “If you do not save your life tonight, tomorrow you will be killed.” 12So Michal let David down through the window, and he fled and escaped. 13And Michal took the household idol and laid it on the bed, put a pillow of goats’ hair at its head, and covered it with clothes. 14And when Saul sent messengers to take David, she said, “He is sick.” 15Then Saul sent the messengers [again] to see David, saying, “Bring him up to me on his bed [if necessary], so that I may kill him.” 16When the messengers came in, there was the household idol on the bed with a quilt of goats’ hair at its head. 17Saul said to Michal, “Why have you deceived me like this and let my enemy go, so that he has escaped?” Michal answered Saul, “He said to me, ‘Let me go! Why should I kill you?’”\n\n18So David fled and escaped and came to Samuel at Ramah, and told him everything that Saul had done to him. And he and Samuel went and stayed in Naioth. 19Saul was told, “David is at Naioth in Ramah.” 20Then Saul sent messengers to take David; but when they saw the group of prophets prophesying, and Samuel standing and presiding over them, the Spirit of God came on the messengers of Saul; and they also prophesied. 21When Saul was informed, he sent other messengers, and they also prophesied. So Saul sent messengers again, the third time, and they prophesied as well. 22Then Saul went to Ramah himself and came to the great well that is in Secu; and he asked, “Where are Samuel and David?” And he was told, “They are at Naioth [with the prophets] in Ramah.” 23So he went on to Naioth in Ramah; and the Spirit of God came upon him too, and he went along continually prophesying until he came to Naioth in Ramah. 24He also took off his [royal] robes [and armor] and prophesied before Samuel and lay down naked all that day and night. So they say, “Is Saul also among the prophets?”\n\n1 Samuel 20\nDavid And Jonathan’s Covenant\n\n1David fled from Naioth in Ramah and he came and said to Jonathan, “What have I done? What is my guilt? What is my sin before (against) your father, that he is seeking my life?” 2Jonathan said to him, “Far from it! You shall not die. My father does nothing important or insignificant without telling me. So why would he hide this thing from me? It is not so!” 3But David vowed again, saying “Your father certainly knows that I have found favor in your sight, and he has said, ‘Do not let Jonathan know this, or he will be worried.’ But truly as the LORD lives and as your soul lives, there is hardly a step between me and death.” 4Then Jonathan said to David, “Whatever you say, I will do for you.” 5David said to Jonathan, “Behold, tomorrow is the New Moon [observance], and I should sit at the table to eat [the sacrificial meal] with the king; but let me go, so that I may hide myself in the field until the third evening. 6If your father misses me at all, then say, ‘David earnestly asked permission from me to go to Bethlehem, his city, because it is the yearly sacrifice there for the entire family.’ 7If he says, ‘All right,’ your servant will be safe; but if he is very angry, then be certain that he has decided on evil. 8“Therefore show kindness to your servant, because you have brought your servant into a covenant of the LORD with you. But if there is iniquity (guilt) in me, kill me yourself; for why should you bring me to your father [to be killed]?” 9Jonathan said, “Far be it from [happening to] you! In fact, if I indeed learn that my father has decided to harm you, would I not tell you about it?” 10Then David said to Jonathan, “Who will tell me if your father answers you harshly?” 11Jonathan said to David, “Come, let us go out into the field [to talk].” So they went out to the field.\n\n12Then Jonathan said to David, “The LORD, the God of Israel, is my witness! When I have sounded out my father about this time tomorrow, or the third day, behold, if he has a good feeling toward you, shall I not then send word to you and make it known to you? 13But if it pleases my father to do you harm, may the LORD do so to Jonathan, and more if I do not let you know about it and send you away, so that you may go in safety. And may the LORD be with you as He has been with my father. 14If I am still alive, will you not show me the lovingkindness and faithfulness of the LORD, so that I will not die? 15“You shall never cut off your lovingkindness and faithfulness from my house, not even when the LORD cuts off every one of the enemies of David from the face of the earth.” 16So Jonathan made a covenant with the house of David. [He added,] “May the LORD require it at the hands of David’s enemies. [that is, hold them accountable for any harm they inflict on David].” 17Jonathan made David vow again because of his love for him, for Jonathan loved him as himself.\n\n18Then Jonathan said to David, “Tomorrow is the New Moon [festival], and you will be missed because your seat will be empty. 19When you have stayed for three days, you shall go down quickly and come to the place where you hid yourself on that eventful day [when my father tried to kill you], and shall stay by the stone Ezel. 20I will shoot three arrows to the side of it, as though I shot at a target. 21And I will send a boy, saying, ‘Go, find the arrows.’ If I specifically say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are on this side of you, get them,’ then come [back to my father’s table]; for it is safe for you and there is no danger, as the LORD lives. 22But if I say to the boy, ‘Look, the arrows are beyond you,’ then go, for the LORD has sent you away. 23“As for the agreement of which you and I have spoken, behold, the LORD is between you and me forever [making sure that we each keep our word].”\n\n24So David hid in the field; and when the New Moon [festival] came, the king sat down to eat food. 25The king sat on his seat as on previous occasions, on his seat by the wall; then Jonathan stood up, and Abner [his commander] sat down by Saul’s side, but David’s place was empty. 26Yet Saul did not say anything that day, for he thought, “It is an incident [of some kind] and he is not [ceremonially] clean—surely he is unclean.” 27But on the next day, the second day of the new moon, David’s place was empty [again]; and Saul said to Jonathan his son, “Why has the son of Jesse not come to the meal, either yesterday or today?” 28Jonathan answered Saul, “David earnestly asked me for permission to go to Bethlehem. 29He said, ‘Please let me go because our family is holding a sacrifice in the city, and my brother has commanded me to attend. Now, if I have found favor in your eyes, please let me slip away so that I may see my brothers.’ That is why he has not come to the king’s table.”\n\nSaul Is Angry with Jonathan 30Then Saul’s anger burned against Jonathan and he said to him, “You son of a wayward, rebellious woman! Do I not know that you have chosen the son of Jesse [over me] to your own shame, and to the shame of your mother’s nakedness? 31“For as long as the son of Jesse lives on the earth, neither you [as heir to the throne] nor your kingdom will be established. So now, send [someone] and bring him to me, for he must die.” 32Jonathan answered Saul his father, “Why must he be put to death? What has he done?” 33Then Saul hurled his spear at him to strike him down, so Jonathan knew [without any doubt] that his father had decided to put David to death. 34Then Jonathan stood up from the table in the heat of anger, and ate no food on that second day of the new moon (month), for he grieved and worried about David because his father had dishonored him.\n\n35In the morning Jonathan went out to the field for the meeting with David, and a young boy was with him. 36And he said to his boy, “Run, please find the arrows which I am about to shoot.” As the boy ran, he shot an arrow past him. 37When the boy came to the place where Jonathan had shot the arrow, Jonathan called to him, “Is the arrow not beyond you?” 38And Jonathan called out after the boy, “Hurry, be quick, do not stay!” So Jonathan’s boy picked up the arrow and came back to his master. 39But the boy was not aware of anything; only Jonathan and David knew about the matter. 40Jonathan gave his weapons to his boy and said to him, “Go, take them to the city.” 41As soon as the boy was gone, David got up from the south side [beside the mound of stones] and fell on his face to the ground [in submission and respect], and bowed three times. Then they kissed one another and wept together, but David wept more. 42Jonathan told David, “Go in safety, inasmuch as we have sworn to each other in the name of the LORD, saying, ‘The LORD shall be between me and you, and between my descendants and yours forever.’” Then he stood and left, while Jonathan went into the city.\n\n1 Samuel 21\nDavid Takes Consecrated Bread\n\n1Then David went to Nob to Ahimelech the priest; and Ahimelech came trembling [in fear] to meet David and said to him, “Why are you alone, and no one with you?” 2David said to Ahimelech the priest, “The king has commissioned me with a matter and has told me, ‘Let no one know anything about the matter for which I am sending you and with which I have commissioned you. I have directed the young men to a certain place.’ 3“Now what [food] do you have on hand? Give me five loaves of bread, or whatever can be found.” 4The priest answered David, “There is no ordinary (unconsecrated) bread on hand, but there is consecrated bread; [you may have it] if only the young men have kept themselves from women.” 5David answered the priest, “Be assured that women have been kept from us in these three days since I set out, and the bodies of the young men were consecrated (ceremonially clean), although it was an ordinary (unconsecrated) journey; so how much more will their vessels be holy today?” 6So the priest gave him the consecrated bread; for there was no bread there except the bread of the Presence which was removed from before the LORD in order to put hot bread in its place when it was taken away.\n\n7Now one of Saul’s servants was there that day, detained before the LORD; his name was Doeg the Edomite, the chief of Saul’s shepherds.\n\n8David said to Ahimelech, “Do you not have a sword or spear here on hand? For I brought neither my sword nor my [other] weapons with me, because the king’s business was urgent.” 9Then the priest said, “The sword of Goliath the Philistine, whom you killed in the Valley of Elah, is here wrapped in a cloth behind the ephod; if you would take it for yourself, do so. For there is no other here except for it.” And David said, “There is none like that; give it to me.”\n\n10Then David arose and fled from Saul that day, and went to Achish king of Gath. 11The servants of Achish said to him, “Is this not David the king of the land? Did they not sing in praise of this one as they danced, saying,\n‘Saul has slain his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands’?”\n\n12David took these words to heart and was greatly afraid of Achish king of Gath. 13So [fearing for his life] he changed his behavior in their sight, and acted insanely in their hands, and he scribbled on the doors of the gate, and drooled on his beard. 14Then Achish said to his servants, “Look, you see that the man is insane. Why have you brought him to me? 15“Do I lack madmen, that you bring this one to behave like a madman in my presence? Shall this one come into my house?”\n\n1 Samuel 22\nThe Priests Slain At Nob\n\n1So David departed from there and escaped to the cave of Adullam; and when his brothers and all his father’s house heard about it, they went down there to him. 2Everyone who was suffering hardship, and everyone who was in debt, and everyone who was discontented gathered to him; and he became captain over them. There were about four hundred men with him.\n\n3And David went from there to Mizpah of Moab; and he said to the king of Moab, “Please let my father and my mother come [out of Judah] and stay with you until I know what God will do for me.” 4Then he left them with the king of Moab; and they stayed with him all the time that David was in the stronghold. 5Then the prophet Gad said to David, “Do not stay in the stronghold; leave, and go into the land of Judah.” So David left and went into the forest of Hereth.\n\n6But Saul heard that David and the men who were with him had been discovered. Now Saul was in Gibeah, sitting under the tamarisk tree on the high place with his spear in his hand, and all his servants were standing around him. 7Saul said to his servants who were standing around him, “Listen now, you Benjamites! Will the son of Jesse also give every one of you fields and vineyards? Will he make you all commanders of thousands and hundreds? 8“For all of you have conspired against me so that no one informs me when my son [Jonathan] makes a covenant with the son of Jesse. None of you cares about me or informs me that my son has stirred up my servant against me to lie in ambush, as he does this day?” 9Then Doeg the Edomite, who was standing with Saul’s servants, replied, “I saw the son of Jesse coming to Nob, to Ahimelech [the priest] the son of Ahitub. 10“Ahimelech inquired of the LORD for him, and gave him provisions and the sword of Goliath the Philistine.”\n\n11Then the king sent someone to call Ahimelech the priest, the son of Ahitub, and all his father’s household, the priests who were at Nob; and all of them came to the king. 12Then Saul said, “Listen now, son of Ahitub.” He replied, “Here I am [at your service], my lord.” 13Saul said to him, “Why have you and the son of Jesse conspired against me, in that you have given him bread and a sword and have inquired of God for him, so he would rebel against me by lying in ambush, as he does this day?”\n\n14Then Ahimelech answered the king, “And who among all your servants is as faithful and trustworthy as David, who is the king’s son-in-law, and who is captain over your guard [and your confidant], and is honored in your house? 15“Did I just begin to inquire of God for him today? Far be it from me! Do not let the king impute any guilt to his servant or to any of the household of my father, for your servant knows nothing at all about this entire matter.” 16But Saul said, “Be assured that you shall die, Ahimelech, you and all your father’s household (extended family).” 17And the king said to the guards who stood around him, “Turn around and kill the priests of the LORD, because their loyalty also is with David, and because they knew that he was fleeing and did not inform me.” But the servants of the king were not willing to put out their hands to attack the LORD’S priests. 18So the king said to Doeg, “You turn around and attack the priests.” And Doeg the Edomite turned and attacked the priests, and that day he killed eighty-five men who wore the [priest’s] linen ephod. 19And he struck Nob the city of the priests with the edge of the sword, both men and women, children and infants; also he struck oxen and donkeys and sheep with the edge of the sword.\n\n20But one of the sons of Ahimelech the son of Ahitub, named Abiathar, escaped and fled to David. 21Abiathar told David that Saul had murdered the LORD’S priests. 22Then David said to Abiathar, “I knew that day, when Doeg the Edomite was there, that he would certainly tell Saul. I have brought about the death of everyone in your father’s household (extended family). 23“Stay with me; do not be afraid, for he who seeks my life seeks your life, but you are safe with me.”\n\n1 Samuel 23\nDavid Rescues Keilah\n\n1Then they told David, saying, “Behold, the Philistines are fighting against Keilah and are plundering (robbing) the threshing floors [of the grain].” 2So David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go and attack these Philistines?” And the Lord said to David, “Go and attack the Philistines and save Keilah.” 3But David’s men said to him, “Listen, we are afraid here in Judah. How much more then if we go to Keilah against the battle lines of the Philistines?” 4Then David inquired of the LORD again. And the LORD answered him, “Arise, go down to Keilah, for I will hand over the Philistines to you.” 5So David and his men went to Keilah and fought the Philistines; he drove away their cattle and struck them with a great slaughter. So David rescued the inhabitants of Keilah.\n\n6When Abiathar the son of Ahimelech fled to David at Keilah, he came down with an ephod in his hand. 7Now when Saul was informed that David had come to Keilah, Saul said, “God has handed him over to me, for he shut himself in by entering a city that has double gates and bars.” 8So Saul summoned all the people (soldiers) for war, to go down to Keilah to besiege David and his men. 9But David knew that Saul was plotting evil against him; and he said to Abiathar the priest, “Bring the ephod here.” 10Then David said, “O LORD, the God of Israel, Your servant has heard for certain that Saul intends to come to Keilah, to destroy the city on my account. 11“Will the men of Keilah hand me over to him? Will Saul come down just as Your servant has heard? O LORD, God of Israel, I pray, tell Your servant.” And the LORD said, “He will come down.” 12Then David asked, “Will the men of Keilah surrender me and my men to Saul?” The LORD said, “They will surrender you.” 13Then David and his men, about six hundred, arose and left Keilah, and they went wherever they could go. When Saul was told that David had escaped from Keilah, he gave up the pursuit. 14David stayed in the wilderness in strongholds, in the hill country of the Wilderness of Ziph. Saul searched for him every day, but God did not hand David over to him.\n\nSaul Pursues David 15Now David became aware that Saul had come out to seek his life. David was in the Wilderness of Ziph [in the woods] at Horesh. 16And Jonathan, Saul’s son, arose and went [into the woods] to David at Horesh, and encouraged him in God. 17He said to him, “Do not be afraid; the hand of my father Saul will not find you. You will be king over Israel and I will be second in command to you; my father Saul knows this too.” 18So the two of them made a covenant before the LORD; and David stayed [in the woods] at Horesh and Jonathan went to his house.\n\n19Then the Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding with us in strongholds of Horesh, on the hill of Hachilah, which is south of Jeshimon? 20“Now then, O king, come down [to Ziph] in accordance with all your heart’s desire to do so [and capture him]; and our part shall be to hand him over to the king.” 21Saul said, “May you be blessed by the LORD, because you have had compassion on me. 22Go now, be very persistent and investigate, and see where his haunt is and who has seen him there; for I am told he is very cunning. 23“So look, and take note of all the places where he hides and come back to me with the established facts, then I will go with you. If he is [anywhere] in the land, I will search him out among all the thousands of Judah.”\n\n24So they arose and went to Ziph ahead of Saul. Now David and his men were in the Wilderness of Maon, in the Arabah south of Jeshimon. 25Then Saul and his men went to search for him. When David was told about it, he went down to the rock and stayed [there] in the Wilderness of Maon. When Saul heard it, he pursued David in the Wilderness of Maon. 26Saul went on one side of the mountain, and David and his men on the other side of the mountain. And David was hurrying to get away from Saul, for Saul and his men were surrounding David and his men to capture them. 27But a messenger came to Saul, saying, “Hurry and come, because the Philistines have attacked the land.” 28So Saul returned from pursuing David and went to meet the Philistines; therefore they called that place the Rock of Escape. 29David went up from there and stayed in the strongholds of Engedi.\n\n1 Samuel 24\nDavid Spares Saul’s Life\n\n1When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told, “Behold, David is in the Wilderness of Engedi.” 2Then Saul took three thousand chosen men out of all Israel and went to search for David and his men in front of the Rocks of the Wild Goats. 3On the way he came to the sheepfolds where there was a cave; and Saul went in to relieve himself. Now David and his men were sitting in the cave’s innermost recesses. 4David’s men said to him, “Behold, this is the day of which the LORD said to you, ‘Behold, I will hand over your enemy to you, and you shall do to him as seems good to you.’” Then David arose [in the darkness] and stealthily cut off the hem (edge) of Saul’s robe. 5Afterward, David’s conscience bothered him because he had cut off the hem of Saul’s robe. 6He said to his men, “The LORD forbid that I should do this thing to my master, the LORD’S anointed, to put out my hand against him, since he is the anointed of the LORD.” 7So David strongly rebuked his men with these words and did not let them rise up against Saul. Saul got up, left the cave and went on his way.\n\n8Then David also got up afterward and went out of the cave and called after Saul, saying, “My lord the king!” And when Saul looked behind him, David bowed with his face to the ground and lay himself face down. 9David said to Saul, “Why do you listen to the words of men who say, ‘David seeks to harm you?’ 10Behold, your eyes have seen today how the LORD had given you into my hand in the cave. Some told me to kill you, but I spared you; I said, ‘I will not reach out my hand against my lord, for he is the LORD’S anointed.’ 11Look, my father! Indeed, see the hem of your robe in my hand! Since I cut off the hem of your robe and did not kill you, know and understand [without question] that there is no evil or treason in my hands. I have not sinned against you, though you are lying in wait to take my life. 12May the LORD judge between me and you; and may the LORD avenge me on you; but my hand shall not be against you. 13As the proverb of the ancients says, ‘Out of the wicked comes wickedness’; but my hand shall not be against you. 14After whom has the king of Israel come out? Whom do you pursue [with three thousand men]? A dead dog, a single flea? 15“May the LORD be the judge and render judgment between me and you; and may He see and plead my cause and vindicate me by saving me from your hand.”\n\n16When David had finished saying these words to Saul, Saul said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” Then Saul raised his voice and wept. 17He said to David, “You are more righteous and upright [in God’s eyes] than I; for you have done good to me, but I have done evil to you. 18You have declared today the good that you have done to me, for when the LORD put me into your hand, you did not kill me. 19For if a man finds his enemy, will he let him go away unharmed? So may the LORD reward you with good in return for what you have done for me this day. 20Now, behold, I know that you will certainly be king and that the kingdom of Israel will be established in your hand. 21“So now swear to me by the LORD that you will not cut off my descendants after me and that you will not destroy my name from my father’s household (extended family).” 22David gave Saul his oath; and Saul went home, but David and his men went up to the mountain stronghold.\n\n1 Samuel 25\nSamuel’s Death\n\n1Now Samuel died; and all Israel assembled and mourned for him, and they buried him at his house in Ramah. Then David left and went down to the Wilderness of Paran.\n\nNabal and Abigail 2Now there was a man in Maon whose business and possessions were in Carmel; and the man was very rich. He had three thousand sheep and a thousand goats, and he was shearing his sheep in Carmel 3(now the man’s name was Nabal and his wife’s name was Abigail. She was intelligent and beautiful in appearance, but the man was harsh and evil in his dealings; he was a Calebite). 4David heard in the wilderness that Nabal was shearing his sheep. 5So David sent ten young men; and David said to the young men, “Go up to Carmel and go to Nabal, and greet him in my name; 6and this is what you shall say, ‘Have a long life! Peace be to you, and peace to your house, and peace to all that you have. 7‘Now I have heard that you have shearers. Now your shepherds have been with us and we have not harmed them, nor were they missing anything all the time they were in Carmel. 8‘Ask your young men and they will tell you. Therefore let my young men find favor in your sight [and be well-treated], for we have come on a good (festive) day. Please, give whatever you find at hand to your servants and to your son David.’”\n\n9When David’s young men came, they spoke to Nabal according to all these words in the name of David; then they waited. 10But Nabal answered David’s servants and said, “Who is David? And who is the son of Jesse? There are many servants today, each of whom is breaking away from his master. 11“So should I take my bread and my water and my meat that I have slaughtered for my shearers, and give it to men when I do not know where they are from?” 12So David’s young men made their way back and returned; and they came and told him everything that was said [to them by Nabal]. 13David said to his men, “Each man put on your sword.” So each man put on his sword. David also put on his sword, and about four hundred men went up behind David while two hundred stayed back with the provisions and supplies.\n\n14But one of Nabal’s young men told Abigail, Nabal’s wife, “Listen, David sent messengers out of the wilderness to bless (greet) our master, and he shouted at them [in contempt]. 15But David’s men were very good to us, and we were not harmed or treated badly, nor did we miss anything as long as we were with them, when we were in the fields. 16They were a wall [of protection] to us both night and day, all the time that we were with them tending the sheep. 17“Now then, know this and consider what you should do, for evil is [already] planned against our master and against all his household; but he is such a worthless and wicked man that one cannot speak [reasonably] to him.”\n\nAbigail Intercedes 18Then Abigail hurried and took two hundred loaves of bread, two jugs of wine, five sheep already prepared [for roasting], five measures of roasted grain, a hundred clusters of raisins, and two hundred cakes of figs, and loaded them on donkeys. 19She said to her young men (servants), “Go on ahead of me; behold, I am coming after you.” But she did not tell her husband Nabal. 20It happened that as she was riding on her donkey and coming down by [way of] the hidden part of the mountain, that suddenly David and his men were coming down toward her, and she met them. 21Now David had said, “Surely in vain I have protected and guarded all that this man has in the wilderness, so that nothing was missing of all that belonged to him; and he has repaid me evil for good. 22“May God do so to the enemies of David, and more also, if by morning I leave [alive] even one male of any who belong to him.”\n\n23When Abigail saw David, she hurried and dismounted from the donkey, and kneeled face downward before David and bowed down to the ground [in respect]. 24Kneeling at his feet she said, “My lord, let the blame and guilt be on me alone. And please let your maidservant speak to you, and listen to the words of your maidservant. 25Please do not let my lord pay attention to this worthless man, Nabal, for as his name is, so is he. Nabal (fool) is his name and foolishness (stupidity) is with him; but I your maidservant did not see my lord’s young men whom you sent.\n\n26So now, my lord, as the LORD lives, and as your soul lives, since the LORD has prevented you from shedding blood, and from avenging yourself by your own hand, now then let your enemies and those who seek to do evil to my lord, be as [self-destructive as] Nabal. 27Now this gift, which your maidservant has brought my lord, let it be given to the young men who accompany and follow my lord. 28Please forgive the transgression of your maidservant; for the LORD will certainly make my lord a secure and enduring house, because my lord is fighting the battles of the LORD, and evil will not be found in you all your days. 29Should anyone rise up to pursue you and to seek your life, then the life of my lord will be bound in the [precious] bundle of the living with the LORD your God; but the lives of your enemies—those He will hurl out as from the center of a sling. 30And it will happen when the LORD does for my lord according to all the good that He has spoken (promised) concerning you, and appoints you ruler over Israel, 31that this [incident] will not cause grief or [bring] a troubled conscience to my lord, both by having shed blood without cause and by my lord having avenged himself. When the LORD deals well with my lord, then remember [with favor] your maidservant.”\n\n32David said to Abigail, “Blessed be the LORD, the God of Israel, who sent you to meet me this day. 33And blessed be your discretion and discernment, and blessed be you, who has kept me from bloodshed this day and from avenging myself by my own hand. 34“Nevertheless, as the LORD the God of Israel lives, who has prevented me from harming you, if you had not come quickly to meet me, most certainly by the morning light there would not have been left to Nabal so much as one male.” 35So David accepted what she had brought to him and said to her, “Go up to your house in peace. See, I have listened to you and have granted your request.”\n\n36Then Abigail came to Nabal, and he was holding a feast in his house [for the shearers], like the feast of a king. And Nabal’s mood was joyous because he was very drunk; so she told him nothing at all until the morning light. 37But in the morning, when Nabal was sober, and his wife told him these things, his heart died within him and he became [paralyzed and helpless] like a stone. 38About ten days later, the LORD struck Nabal and he died.\n\nDavid Marries Abigail 39When David heard that Nabal was dead, he said, “Blessed be the LORD, who has pleaded the cause of my reproach [suffered] at the hand of Nabal and has kept His servant from [retaliating with] evil. For the Lord has returned the wickedness of Nabal on his own head.” Then David sent word to Abigail, proposing to take her as his wife. 40When the servants of David came to Abigail at Carmel, they said to her, “David sent us to you to take you [to him] to be his wife.” 41And she stood and bowed with her face to the ground and said, “Behold, your maidservant is [ready to be] a maid to wash the feet of the servants of my lord.” 42Then Abigail quickly got up, and rode on a donkey, with five of her maidens who attended her; and she followed the messengers of David and became his wife.\n\n43David had also taken Ahinoam of Jezreel, and they both became his wives.\n\n44But Saul had given Michal his [younger] daughter, David’s wife, to Palti the son of Laish, who was from Gallim.\n\n1 Samuel 26\nDavid Again Spares Saul\n\n1The Ziphites came to Saul at Gibeah, saying, “Is David not hiding on the hill of Hachilah, east of Jeshimon?” 2So Saul arose and went down to the Wilderness of Ziph, taking with him three thousand chosen men of Israel, to search for David [there] in the wilderness of Ziph. 3Saul camped on the hill of Hachilah, which is beside the road east of Jeshimon, but David stayed in the wilderness. When he saw that Saul came into the wilderness after him, 4David sent out spies, and he learned that Saul was definitely coming. 5So David arose and went to the place where Saul had camped, and saw the spot where Saul lay, as well as Abner the son of Ner, the commander of his army; and Saul was lying inside the circle of the camp, with the army camped around him.\n\n6Then David said to Ahimelech the Hittite and to Abishai the son of Zeruiah, brother of Joab, “Who will go down with me to Saul in the camp?” And Abishai said, “I will go down with you.” 7So David and Abishai went to the army during the night, and there was Saul lying asleep inside the circle of the camp with his spear stuck in the ground by his head; and Abner and the people were lying around him. 8Then Abishai said to David, “God has given your enemy into your hand this day; now then, please let me strike him with the spear driving it to the ground with one stroke, and I will not strike him the second time.” 9But David said to Abishai, “Do not kill him, for who can put out his hand against the LORD’S anointed [king] and be guiltless (innocent)?” 10David also said, “As the LORD lives, most certainly the LORD will strike him [in His own time and way], or his day will come and he will die, or he will go down into battle and be carried off [dead]. 11“The LORD forbid that I would put out my hand against the LORD’S anointed; but now take the spear that is by his head and the jug of water, and let us go.” 12So David took the spear and the jug of water from beside Saul’s head, and they left, and no one saw or knew nor did anyone awaken, because they were all sound asleep, for a deep sleep from the LORD had fallen on them.\n\n13Then David crossed over to the other side and stood on the top of the mountain at a distance, with a large area between them. 14David called to the army and to Abner the son of Ner, “Will you not answer, Abner?” Abner replied, “Who are you who calls [and disturbs] the king?” 15David said to Abner, “Are you not a [brave] man? Who is like you in Israel? Why then have you not guarded your lord the king? For one of the people came [into your camp] to kill the king your lord. 16“This thing that you have done is not good. As the LORD lives, you surely deserve to die, because you have not guarded your lord, the LORD’S anointed. And now, see where the king’s spear is, and the jug of water that was by his head.”\n\n17Then Saul recognized David’s voice and said, “Is this your voice, my son David?” And David said, “It is my voice, my lord the king!” 18And David said, “Why is my lord pursuing his servant? For what have I done? Or what evil is in my hand? 19Now therefore, please let my lord the king hear the words of his servant. If the LORD has incited you against me, let Him accept an offering [from me]; but if it is men, may they be cursed before the LORD, because they have driven me out this day to keep me from sharing in the inheritance of the LORD, saying, ‘Go, serve other gods.’ 20“Now then, do not let my blood fall to the ground away from the presence of the LORD; for the king of Israel has come out to search for a single flea, just as when one hunts a [defenseless] partridge in the mountains.”\n\n21Then Saul said, “I have sinned. Return, my son David, for I will not harm you again because my life was precious in your sight this day. Hear me, I have played the fool and have done a very great wrong [to you].” 22David answered, “Look, here is the king’s spear! Now let one of the young men come over and get it. 23The LORD will repay each man for his righteousness and his faithfulness; for the LORD handed you over to me today, but I refused to put out my hand against the LORD’S anointed. 24“Now behold, just as your life was precious in my sight this day, so let my life be precious in the sight of the LORD, and may He rescue me from all distress.” 25Then Saul said to David, “May you be blessed, my son David; you will both accomplish much and certainly prevail.” So David went on his way, and Saul returned to his place.\n\n1 Samuel 27\nDavid Flees To The Philistines\n\n1But David said in his heart, “Now I will die one day by the hand of Saul. There is nothing better for me than to escape to the land of the Philistines. Then Saul will give up searching for me inside the borders of Israel, and I will escape from his hand [once and for all].” 2So David and the six hundred men who were with him arose and crossed over to Achish the son of Maoch, king of Gath. 3And David lived with Achish at Gath, he and his men, each man with his household, and David with his two wives, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess, and Abigail the Carmelitess, [who was] Nabal’s widow. 4When Saul was told that David had fled to Gath, he no longer searched for him.\n\n5Then David said to Achish, “If I have found favor in your sight, let me be given a place [of my own] in one of the cities in the country, so that I may live there; for why should your servant live in the royal city with you?” 6Then Achish gave David [the town of] Ziklag that day. Therefore Ziklag has belonged to the kings of Judah to this day. 7The number of days that David lived in the country of the Philistines was a year and four months.\n\n8Now David and his men went up and raided the Geshurites, the Girzites, and the Amalekites [the enemies of Israel that Joshua had failed to annihilate]; for they had inhabited the land from ancient times, as one comes to Shur even as far as the land of Egypt. 9David attacked the land and did not leave a man or a woman alive, but he took the sheep, the cattle, the donkeys, the camels, and the clothing, and returned to Achish. 10When Achish asked, “Where did you raid today?” David replied, “Against the Negev (the South country) of Judah, and against the Negev of the Jerahmeelites, and against the Negev of the Kenites.” 11David did not leave a man or a woman alive to bring news to Gath, saying [to himself], “Otherwise they will tell about us, saying, ‘This is what David has done, and this has been his practice all the time that he has lived in the country of the Philistines.’” 12Achish believed David, saying, “He has certainly become hated by his people in Israel; so he will always be my servant.”\n\n1 Samuel 28\nSaul And The Spirit Medium\n\n1In those days the Philistines gathered their forces for war to fight against Israel. Achish said to David, “Understand for certain that you and your men will go out with me to battle.” 2David said to Achish, “All right, you shall know what your servant can do.” So Achish said to David, “Therefore I will make you my bodyguard for life.”\n\n3Now Samuel had died, and all Israel had mourned for him and buried him in Ramah, his own city. And Saul had removed the mediums and the spiritists (soothsayers) from the land. 4The Philistines assembled and came and camped at Shunem; and Saul gathered all the Israelites and they camped at Gilboa. 5When Saul saw the Philistine army, he was afraid and badly shaken. 6So Saul inquired of the LORD, but the LORD did not answer him, either by dreams or by Urim [used like lots by the priest to determine the will of God] or by prophets. 7Then Saul said to his servants, “Find for me a woman who is a medium [between the living and the dead], so that I may go to her and ask her advice.” His servants said to him, “There is a woman who is a medium at En-dor.”\n\n8So Saul disguised himself by wearing different clothes, and he left with two men, and they came to the woman at night. He said to her, “Conjure up for me, please, and bring up [from the dead] for me [the spirit] whom I shall name to you.” 9But the woman said to him, “See here, you know what Saul has done, how he has cut off (eliminated) those who are mediums and spiritists from the land. So why are you laying a trap for my life, to cause my death?” 10Then Saul swore [an oath] to her by the LORD, saying, “As the LORD lives, no punishment shall come upon you for this.” 11So the woman said, “Whom shall I bring up for you?” He said, “Bring up Samuel for me.” 12When the woman saw Samuel, she screamed with a loud voice; and she said to Saul, “Why have you deceived me? You are Saul!” 13The king said to her, “Do not be afraid; but [tell me] what do you see?” The woman said to Saul, “I see a divine [superhuman] being coming up from the earth.” 14He said to her, “What is his appearance?” And she said, “An old man is coming up, wrapped in a robe.” Then Saul knew that it was Samuel, and he bowed with his face to the ground and paid respect [to him].\n\n15Then Samuel said to Saul, “Why have you disturbed me by bringing me up?” Saul answered, “I am greatly distressed; for the Philistines are making war against me, and God has left me and no longer answers me, either through prophets or by dreams; therefore I have called you to make known to me what I should do.” 16Samuel said, “Why then do you ask me, since the LORD has left you and has become your enemy? 17The LORD has done [to you] just as He said through me [when I was with you]; for the LORD has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given it to your neighbor, to David. 18Because you did not obey the voice of the LORD and did not execute His fierce wrath on Amalek, therefore the LORD has done this thing to you this day. 19“Moreover, the LORD will also put Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines, and tomorrow you and your sons will be with me [among the dead]. Indeed, the LORD will put the army of Israel into the hands of the Philistines.”\n\n20Then Saul immediately fell full length on the earth [floor of the medium’s house], and was very afraid because of Samuel’s words; and he was thoroughly exhausted because he had not eaten all day and all night. 21The woman came to Saul and saw that he was greatly troubled, and she said to him, “Look, your maidservant has obeyed you, and I have taken my life in my hand and have listened to everything you said to me. 22“So now, please listen to the voice of your maidservant, and let me set a piece of bread before you, and eat, so that you may have strength when you go on your way.” 23But he refused and said, “I will not eat.” But his servants together with the woman urged him, and he [finally] listened to them. So he got up from the ground and sat on the bed. 24The woman had a fattened calf in the house; she quickly killed it, and took flour, kneaded it and baked unleavened bread. 25She brought it before Saul and his servants, and they ate. Then they got up and went away that night.\n\n1 Samuel 29\nThe Philistines Mistrust David\n\n1Now the Philistines gathered all their forces at Aphek, while Israel camped by the spring in Jezreel. 2As the Philistine lords (governors) were proceeding on [marching] by hundreds and by thousands, and David and his men were proceeding on in the rear with Achish [the king of Gath], 3the Philistine commanders [having noticed David] said, “What are these Hebrews doing here?” Achish said to the Philistine commanders, “Is this not David, the servant of Saul king of Israel, who has been with me these days and years, and I have found no fault in him from the day he deserted to me to this day?” 4But the Philistine commanders were angry with Achish and they said to him, “Make this man return, so that he may go back to his place where you have assigned him, and do not let him go down to battle with us, or in the battle he may [turn and] become our adversary. For how could David reconcile himself to his lord [Saul]? Would it not be with the heads of these [Philistine] men? 5“Is this not David, of whom they used to sing in dances,\n‘Saul killed his thousands,\nAnd David his ten thousands’?”\n\n6Then Achish called David and said to him, “As the LORD lives, you have been upright (righteous), and your behavior in the army is pleasing in my sight. For from the day you came to me to this day I have found no evil in you. Nevertheless, the [Philistine] lords do not approve of you. 7“So return now and go in peace [to your place], so that you do not displease the Philistine lords.” 8David said to Achish, “But what have I done? What have you found in your servant from the day when I [first] came before you to this day, that I may not go and fight against the enemies of my lord the king?” 9Achish answered David, “I know that you are blameless in my sight, like an angel of God; nevertheless the commanders of the Philistines have said, ‘He must not go up with us to the battle.’ 10“So now, get up early in the morning with your master’s servants who have come with you, and as soon as you are up in the morning and have light, leave.” 11So David and his men got up early to leave in the morning, to return to the land of the Philistines. But the Philistines went up to Jezreel [to fight against Israel].\n\n1 Samuel 30\nDavid’s Victory Over The Amalekites\n\n1Now it happened when David and his men came [home] to Ziklag on the third day, [they found] that the Amalekites had made a raid on the Negev (the South country) and on Ziklag, and had overthrown Ziklag and burned it with fire; 2and they had taken captive the women [and all] who were there, both small and great. They killed no one, but carried them off [to be used as slaves] and went on their way. 3When David and his men came to the town, it was burned, and their wives and their sons and their daughters had been taken captive. 4Then David and the people who were with him raised their voices and wept until they were too exhausted to weep [any longer]. 5Now David’s two wives had been captured, Ahinoam the Jezreelitess and Abigail the widow of Nabal the Carmelite. 6Further, David was greatly distressed because the people spoke of stoning him, for all of them were embittered, each man for his sons and daughters. But David felt strengthened and encouraged in the LORD his God.\n\n7David said to Abiathar the priest, Ahimelech’s son, “Please bring me the ephod.” So Abiathar brought him the ephod. 8David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I pursue this band [of raiders]? Will I overtake them?” And He answered him, “Pursue, for you will certainly overtake them, and you will certainly rescue [the captives].” 9So David went, he and the six hundred men who were with him, and came to the brook Besor; there those [who could not continue] remained behind. 10But David pursued [the Amalekites], he and four hundred men, for two hundred who were too exhausted to cross the brook Besor stayed behind.\n\n11They found an Egyptian [who had collapsed] in the field and brought him to David, and gave him bread and he ate, and they gave him water to drink, 12and they gave him a piece of a fig cake and two clusters of raisins; and when he had eaten, his energy returned, for he had not eaten bread or had any water to drink for three days and three nights. 13David said to him, “To whom do you belong, and where are you from?” He said, “I am a young man from Egypt, a servant of an Amalekite; and my master abandoned me [as useless] when I fell sick three days ago. 14“We made a raid on the Negev of the Cherethites, and on that which belongs to Judah, and on the Negev of Caleb, and we burned Ziklag with fire.” 15Then David said to him, “Will you take me down to this band [of raiders]?” And he said, “Swear to me by God that you will not kill me or turn me over to the hand of my master, and I will bring you down to this band.”\n\n16When he brought David down, the Amalekites had disbanded and spread over all the land, eating and drinking and dancing because of all the great spoil they had taken from the land of the Philistines and from the land of Judah. 17Then David [and his men] struck them down [in battle] from twilight until the evening of the next day; and not a man of them escaped, except four hundred young men who rode camels and fled. 18So David recovered all that the Amalekites had taken, and rescued his two wives. 19Nothing of theirs was missing whether small or great, sons or daughters, spoil or anything that had been taken; David recovered it all. 20So David captured all the flocks and herds [which the enemy had], and [the people] drove those animals before him and said, “This is David’s spoil.”\n\nThe Spoils Are Divided 21David came to the two hundred men who were so exhausted that they could not follow him and had been left at the brook Besor [with the provisions]. They went out to meet David and the people with him, and when he approached the people, he greeted them. 22Then all the wicked and worthless men among those who went with David said, “Because they did not go with us, we will give them none of the spoil that we have recovered, except that each man may take his wife and children away and leave.” 23David said, “You must not do so, my brothers, with what the LORD has given us. He has kept us safe and has handed over to us the band [of Amalekites] that came against us. 24“And who will listen to you in regard to this matter? For as is the share of him who goes down into the battle, so shall his share be who stays by the provisions and supplies; they shall share alike.” 25So from that day forward he made it a statute and an ordinance for Israel to this day.\n\n26When David came to Ziklag, he sent part of the spoil to the elders of Judah, his friends, saying, “Here is a blessing (gift) for you from the spoil of the enemies of the LORD: 27For those in Bethel, Ramoth of the Negev, Jattir, 28Aroer, Siphmoth, Eshtemoa, 29Racal, the cities of the Jerahmeelites, the cities of the Kenites, 30Hormah, Bor-ashan, Athach, 31Hebron, and for [those elders in] all the places where David himself and his men were accustomed to go.”\n\n1 Samuel 31\nSaul And His Sons Slain\n\n1Now the Philistines fought against Israel, and the men of Israel fled before them and fell slain on Mount Gilboa. 2The Philistines overtook Saul and his sons; and they killed Jonathan and Abinadab and Malchi-shua, Saul’s sons. 3The battle went heavily against Saul, and the archers hit him; and he was severely wounded by the archers. 4Saul said to his armor bearer, “Draw your sword and pierce me through with it, otherwise these uncircumcised [Philistines] will come and pierce me through and abuse and mock me.” But his armor bearer would not, because he was terrified [of doing such a thing]. So Saul took his sword and fell on it. 5When his armor bearer saw that Saul was dead, he also fell on his sword and died with him. 6So Saul, his three sons, his armor bearer, and all his men died together on that day.\n\n7When the men of Israel who were on the other side of the valley [of Jezreel], and those who were beyond the Jordan, saw that the other men of Israel had fled and that Saul and his sons were dead, they abandoned the cities and fled; then the Philistines came and lived in them.\n\n8The next day, when the Philistines came to plunder the dead, they found Saul and his three sons fallen on Mount Gilboa. 9So they cut off Saul’s head and stripped off his weapons and armor and sent them throughout the land of the Philistines, to bring the good news to the house of their idols and to the people. 10And they put Saul’s weapons and armor in the temple of the Ashtaroth (female goddesses), and they fastened his body to the wall of Beth-shan. 11When the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead heard what the Philistines had done to Saul, 12all the brave men stood and walked all night, and they took the bodies of Saul and his sons from the wall of Beth-shan, and they came to Jabesh and cremated them there. 13They took their bones and buried them under the tamarisk tree at Jabesh, and fasted [as a sign of mourning and respect] for seven days."

          "content": "2 Samuel 1\nDavid Learns Of Saul’s Death\n\n1Now it happened after the death of Saul, when David had returned from the slaughter of the Amalekites, that he stayed two days in Ziklag. 2On the third day a man came [unexpectedly] from Saul’s camp with his clothes torn and dust on his head [as in mourning]. When he came to David, he bowed to the ground and lay himself face down [in an act of great respect and submission]. 3Then David asked him, “Where do you come from?” He said, “I have escaped from the camp of Israel.” 4David said to him, “How did it go? Please tell me.” He answered, “The people have fled from the battle. Also, many of the people have fallen and are dead; Saul and Jonathan his son are also dead.” 5So David said to the young man who informed him, “How do you know Saul and his son Jonathan are dead?” 6And the young man who told him explained, “By chance I happened to be on Mount Gilboa, and there was Saul leaning on his spear, and the chariots and horsemen [of the Philistines] were close behind him. 7When he turned to look behind him, he saw me, and called to me. And I answered, ‘Here I am.’ 8He asked me, ‘Who are you?’ I answered him, ‘I am an Amalekite.’ 9He said to me, ‘Stand up facing me and kill me, for [terrible] agony has come over me, yet I still live [and I will be taken alive].’ 10“So I stood facing him and killed him, because I knew that he could not live after he had fallen. Then I took the crown which was on his head and the band which was on his arm, and I have brought them here to my lord.”\n\n11Then David grasped his own clothes and tore them [in mourning]; so did all the men who were with him. 12They mourned and wept and fasted until evening for Saul and Jonathan his son, and for the LORD’S people and the house of Israel, because they had fallen by the sword [in battle]. 13David said to the young man who informed him, “Where are you from?” He answered, “I am the son of a foreigner (resident alien, sojourner), an Amalekite.” 14David said to him, “How is it that you were not afraid to put out your hand to destroy the LORD’S anointed?” 15David called one of the young men and said, “Go, execute him.” So he struck the Amalekite and he died. 16David said to the [fallen] man, “Your blood is on your own head, for your own mouth has testified against you, saying, ‘I have killed the LORD’S anointed.’”\n\nDavid’s Dirge for Saul and Jonathan 17Then David sang this dirge (funeral song) over Saul and his son Jonathan, 18and he told them to teach the sons of Judah, the song of the bow. Behold, it is written in the Book of Jashar:\n19“Your glory and splendor, O Israel, is slain upon your high places!\nHow the mighty have fallen!\n20“Tell it not in Gath,\nProclaim it not in the streets of Ashkelon,\nOr the daughters of the Philistines will rejoice,\nThe daughters of the uncircumcised (pagans) will exult.\n21“O mountains of Gilboa,\nLet not dew or rain be upon you, nor fields with offerings;\nFor there the shield of the mighty was defiled,\nThe shield of Saul, [dry, cracked] not anointed with oil.\n22“From the blood of the slain, from the fat of the mighty,\nThe bow of Jonathan did not turn back,\nAnd the sword of Saul did not return empty.\n23“Saul and Jonathan, beloved and lovely and friends in their lives,\nAnd in their death they were not separated;\nThey were swifter than eagles,\nThey were stronger than lions.\n24“O daughters of Israel, weep over Saul,\nWho clothed you luxuriously in scarlet,\nWho put ornaments of gold on your apparel.\n25“How the mighty have fallen in the midst of the battle!\nJonathan lies slain upon your high places.\n26“I am distressed for you, my brother Jonathan;\nYou have been a good friend to me.\nYour love toward me was more wonderful\nThan the love of women.\n27“How the mighty have fallen,\nAnd the weapons of war have perished!”\n\n2 Samuel 2\nDavid Made King Over Judah\n\n1So it happened after this that David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up into one of the cities of Judah?” And the LORD said to him, “Go up.” David asked, “Where shall I go?” And He said, “To Hebron.” 2So David went up there [to Hebron] with his two wives also, Ahinoam of Jezreel and Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel [in Judah]. 3And David brought up his men who were with him, each one with his household; and they lived in the cities of Hebron. 4Then the men of Judah came and there they anointed David king over the house of Judah.\n\nThen they told David, “It was the men of Jabesh-gilead who buried Saul.” 5So David sent messengers to the men of Jabesh-gilead, and said to them, “May you be blessed by the LORD because you showed this graciousness and loyalty to Saul your lord (king), and buried him. 6Now may the LORD show lovingkindness and truth and faithfulness to you. I too will show this goodness to you, because you have done this thing. 7“So now, let your hands be strong and be valiant; for your lord Saul is dead, and also the house of Judah has anointed me king over them.”\n\nIsh-bosheth Made King over Israel 8Now [Saul’s cousin] Abner the son of Ner, commander of Saul’s army, had taken Ish-bosheth the son of Saul and brought him over to Mahanaim. 9He made him king over Gilead, over the Ashurites, over Jezreel, over Ephraim, over Benjamin, even over all Israel [except Judah]. 10Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, was forty years old when he became king over Israel, and he reigned for two years. But the house of Judah followed David. 11And the time that David was king in Hebron over the house of Judah was seven years and six months.\n\nCivil War 12Now Abner the son of Ner and the servants of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul went out from Mahanaim to Gibeon. 13Joab [David’s nephew] the son of Zeruiah and the servants of David also went out and met them by the pool of Gibeon. They sat down, with one group on one side of the pool and the other group on the other side of the pool. 14Then Abner said to Joab, “Let the young men now stand and have a contest before us.” And Joab said, “Let them stand.” 15So they stood up and went over by number, twelve for Benjamin and Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, and twelve of the servants of David. 16Each one of them seized his opponent by the head and thrust his sword into his opponents side; so they fell down together. Therefore that place was called Helkath-hazzurim [that is, the Field of Sides], which is in Gibeon. 17There was a very fierce battle that day, and Abner and the men of Israel were beaten before the servants of David.\n\n18Three sons of Zeruiah [the half sister of David] were there: Joab, Abishai, and Asahel. Now Asahel was as light and swift-footed as one of the [wild] gazelles in the field. 19Asahel pursued Abner and did not turn to the right or to the left as he followed him. 20Then Abner looked behind him and said, “Is that you, Asahel?” He answered, “It is I.” 21So Abner said to him, “Turn to your right or to your left, and grab one of the young men and take his armor for yourself.” But Asahel was not willing to turn away from pursuing Abner. 22Abner repeated again, “Turn away from following me. Why should I have to strike you to the ground? How would I be able to face Joab your brother [and look him in the eye]?” 23But Asahel refused to turn away; so Abner struck him in the abdomen with the butt end of his spear, and the spear came out his back; and he fell there and died on that spot. And it came about that everyone who came to the place where Asahel fell and died, stood still [and reflected].\n\n24But Joab and Abishai [Asahel’s brothers] pursued Abner. When the sun was going down, they came to the hill of Ammah, which is in front of Giah on the way to the wilderness of Gibeon. 25And the sons of [the tribe of] Benjamin gathered together behind Abner and became one troop, and took their stand on the top of a hill. 26Then Abner called to Joab, “Must the sword devour forever? Do you not know that it will be bitter in the end? How long [will it be] before you tell the people to stop pursuing their brothers?” 27Joab said, “As God lives, if you had not spoken, then the people certainly would have stopped pursuing their brothers in the morning.” 28So Joab blew the trumpet; and all the people halted and no longer pursued Israel, nor did they fight anymore. 29Then Abner and his men went through the Arabah (desert region) all that night, crossed the Jordan, went through Bithron and walked the whole morning and came to Mahanaim [where Ish-bosheth ruled Israel].\n\n30Joab returned from pursuing Abner; and when he had gathered all the people together, nineteen of David’s servants were missing, besides Asahel. 31But the servants of David had struck down many of Benjamin and Abner’s men; so that three hundred and sixty men died. 32And they picked up [the body of] Asahel and buried him in the tomb of his father in Bethlehem. Then Joab and his men walked all night and they arrived in Hebron at daybreak.\n\n2 Samuel 3\nThe House Of David Strengthened\n\n1There was a long war between the house of Saul and the house of David; but David grew steadily stronger, while the house of Saul grew weaker and weaker [to the point of being powerless].\n\n2Sons were born to David in Hebron: his firstborn was Amnon, by Ahinoam of Jezreel; 3his second, Chileab, by Abigail the widow of Nabal of Carmel; the third, Absalom the son of [his wife] Maacah, daughter of Talmai the king of Geshur; 4the fourth, Adonijah the son of [his wife] Haggith; the fifth, Shephatiah the son of [his wife] Abital; 5and the sixth, Ithream, by David’s wife Eglah. These [sons] were born to David in Hebron.\n\nAbner Joins David 6Now while war continued between the houses of Saul and David, Abner was proving himself strong in the house of Saul. 7Now Saul had a concubine whose name was Rizpah the daughter of Aiah; and Ish-bosheth said to Abner, “Why have you gone in to my father’s concubine?” 8Then Abner was very angry at the words of Ish-bosheth, and he said, “Am I a dog’s head [a despicable traitor] that belongs to Judah? Today I show loyalty and kindness to the house of Saul your father, to his brothers and his friends, by not having you handed over to David; and yet you charge me today with guilt concerning this woman. 9May God do so to Abner, and more also, if I do not do for David just as the LORD has sworn to him, 10to transfer the kingdom from the house of Saul, and establish the throne of David over Israel and Judah from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south].” 11And Ish-bosheth could not say another word to Abner, because he was afraid of him.\n\n12Then Abner sent messengers to David [who was] in his place [at Hebron], saying, “Whose is the land? Make your covenant (treaty) with me, and behold, my hand shall be with you to bring all Israel over to you.” 13David said, “Good! I will make a covenant (treaty) with you, but I require one thing of you: you shall not see my face unless you first bring Michal, Saul’s daughter, when you come to see me.” 14So David sent messengers to Ish-bosheth, Saul’s son, saying, “Give me my wife Michal, to whom I was betrothed for [the price of] a hundred foreskins of the Philistines.” 15So Ish-bosheth sent and took her from her husband, from Paltiel the son of Laish [to whom Saul had given her]. 16But her husband went with her, weeping continually behind her as far as Bahurim. Then Abner told him, “Go, return.” And he did so.\n\n17Abner talked with the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel, saying, “In times past you were seeking for David to be king over you. 18“Now then, do it [and make him king]! For the LORD has spoken of David, saying, ‘By the hand of My servant David I will save My people Israel from the hand of the Philistines and the hand of all their enemies.’” 19Abner also spoke to [the men of] Benjamin. Then he also went to tell David at Hebron everything that seemed good to Israel and to the entire house of Benjamin.\n\n20So Abner came to David at Hebron, and [brought] twenty men along with him. And David prepared a feast for Abner and the men with him. 21Abner said to David, “Let me stand up and go, and gather all Israel to my lord the king, so that they may make a covenant (treaty) with you, and that you may reign over all that your soul desires.” So David sent Abner away, and he went in peace.\n\n22Then the servants of David came with Joab from a raid and brought a great quantity of spoil with them; but Abner was not with David at Hebron, because David had sent him away, and he had gone in peace. 23When Joab and all the army that was with him arrived, they told Joab, “Abner the son of Ner came to the king, and he has sent him away, and he has gone in peace.” 24Then Joab came to the king and said, “What have you done? Behold, Abner came to you; why did you send him away, so that he is already gone? 25“You know Abner the son of Ner, that he [only] came to deceive you [with flattering words] and to learn of your going out and coming in, and to find out what you are doing.”\n\nJoab Murders Abner 26When Joab left David, he sent messengers after Abner, and they brought him back from the well of Sirah; but David knew nothing [about Joab’s action]. 27So when Abner returned to Hebron, Joab took him aside to the middle of the gate to speak to him privately, and there he struck Abner in the abdomen so that he died, to avenge the blood of Asahel, Joab’s brother. 28Afterward, when David heard of it, he said, “I and my kingdom are forever innocent before the LORD of the blood of Abner the son of Ner. 29“Let the guilt fall on the head of Joab and on all his father’s house (family); and may there never disappear from the house of Joab one who suffers with a discharge or one who is a leper or one who walks with a crutch [being unfit for war], or one who falls by the sword, or one who lacks food.” 30So Joab and Abishai his brother murdered Abner because he had killed their brother Asahel in the battle at Gibeon.\n\nDavid Mourns Abner 31Then David said to Joab and to all the people with him, “Tear your clothes, put on sackcloth, and mourn before Abner.” And King David walked behind the bier. 32They buried Abner in Hebron; and the king raised his voice and wept at the grave of Abner, and all the people wept. 33And the king sang a dirge (funeral song) over Abner and said,\n“Should Abner [the great warrior] die as a fool dies?\n34“Your hands were not bound, nor your feet put in fetters;\nAs a man falls before the wicked, so you have fallen.”\nAnd all the people wept again over him. 35All the people came to urge David to eat food while it was still day; but David took an oath, saying, “May God do so to me, and more also, if I taste bread or anything else before the sun sets.” 36And all the people took notice of it and it pleased them, just as everything that the king did pleased all the people. 37So all the people and all Israel understood that day that it had not been the will of the king to put Abner the son of Ner to death. 38Then the king said to his servants, “Do you not know that a prince and a great man has fallen this day in Israel? 39“Today I am weak, though anointed king; these men, the sons of Zeruiah, are too difficult for me. May the LORD repay the evildoer [Joab] in accordance with his wickedness!”\n\n2 Samuel 4\nIsh-Bosheth Murdered\n\n1When Saul’s son Ish-bosheth [king of Israel], heard that Abner had died in Hebron, he lost courage, and all Israel was horrified. 2Saul’s son had two men who were commanders of [raiding] bands [of soldiers]. One was named Baanah and the other Rechab, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite of the sons (tribe) of Benjamin (for Beeroth is also considered part of [the tribe of] Benjamin, 3and the Beerothites fled to Gittaim, and have been resident aliens there to this day).\n\n4Jonathan, Saul’s son, had a son whose feet were crippled. He was five years old when the news [of the deaths] of Saul and Jonathan came from Jezreel. And the boy’s nurse picked him up and fled; but it happened that while she was hurrying to flee, he fell and became lame. His name was Mephibosheth.\n\n5So the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, Rechab and Baanah, left and came to the house of Ish-bosheth in the heat of the day while he was taking his midday rest. 6They came into the interior of the house as if to get wheat [for the soldiers], and they struck him in the stomach. Then Rechab and Baanah his brother escaped [unnoticed]. 7Now when they entered the house he was lying on his bed in his bedroom. They [not only] struck and killed him, [but] they also beheaded him. Then they took his head and traveled all night by way of the Arabah. 8They brought the head of Ish-bosheth to David at Hebron, and said to the king, “Look, the head of Ish-bosheth the son of Saul, your enemy, who sought your life; thus the LORD has granted my lord the king vengeance this day on Saul and on his descendants.”\n\n9David replied to Rechab and Baanah his brother, the sons of Rimmon the Beerothite, and said to them, “As the LORD lives, who has redeemed my life from every adversity, 10when a man told me, ‘Behold, Saul is dead,’ thinking that he was bringing good news, I seized and killed him in Ziklag, to reward him for his news. 11“How much more, when wicked men have killed a righteous and just man in his own house on his bed, shall I not require his blood from your hand and remove you from the earth?” 12So David commanded his young men, and they killed them and cut off their hands and feet and hung them beside the pool in Hebron. But they took Ish-bosheth’s head and buried it in Hebron in the tomb of Abner [his relative].\n\n2 Samuel 5\nDavid King Over All Israel\n\n1Then all the tribes of Israel came to David at Hebron and said, “Behold, we are your bone and your flesh. 2“In times past, when Saul was king over us, it was you who led Israel out [to war] and brought Israel in [from battle]. And the LORD told you, ‘You shall shepherd My people Israel and be ruler over them.’” 3So all the elders (tribal leaders) of Israel came to the king at Hebron, and King David made a covenant with them at Hebron before the LORD; and they anointed him king over Israel. 4David was thirty years old when he became king, and he reigned forty years. 5In Hebron he reigned over Judah seven years and six months, and in Jerusalem he reigned thirty-three years over all Israel and Judah.\n\n6Now the king and his men went to Jerusalem against the Jebusites, the inhabitants of the land, who said to David, “You shall not enter here, for the blind and the lame [even the weakest among us] will turn you away”; they thought, “David cannot come in here [because the walls are impenetrable].” 7Nevertheless, David captured the stronghold (fortress) of Zion, that is, the City of David. 8Then David said on that day, “Whoever strikes the Jebusites, let him go up through the [underground] water shaft to strike the lame and the blind, who are detested by David’s soul [because of their arrogance].” So [for that reason] they say, “The blind or the lame (Jebusites) shall not come into the [royal] house [of Israel].” 9So David lived in the stronghold and called it the City of David. And he built all around [the surrounding area] from the Millo [fortification] and inward. 10David became greater and greater, for the LORD, the God of hosts (armies), was with him.\n\n11Now Hiram the king of Tyre sent messengers to David with cedar trees, carpenters, and stonemasons; and they built a house (palace) for David. 12And David knew that the LORD had established him as king over Israel, and that He had exalted his kingdom for His people Israel’s sake.\n\n13David took more concubines and wives from Jerusalem, after he came from Hebron; and more sons and daughters were born to him. 14And these are the names of those who were born to him in Jerusalem: Shammua, Shobab, Nathan, Solomon, 15Ibhar, Elishua, Nepheg, Japhia, 16Elishama, Eliada, and Eliphelet.\n\nWar with the Philistines 17When the Philistines heard that David had been anointed king over Israel, all the Philistines went up to look for him, but he heard about it and went down to the stronghold. 18Now the Philistines had come and spread out [for battle] in the Valley of Rephaim. 19David inquired of the LORD, saying, “Shall I go up against the Philistines? Will You hand them over to me?” And the LORD said to David, “Go up, for I will certainly hand them over to you.” 20So David came to Baal-perazim, and he defeated them there, and said, “The LORD has broken through my enemies before me, like a breakthrough of water.” So he named that place Baal-perazim (master of breakthroughs). 21The Philistines abandoned their [pagan] idols there, so David and his men took them away [to be burned].\n\n22The Philistines came up once again and spread out in the Valley of Rephaim. 23When David inquired of the LORD, He said, “You shall not go up, but circle around behind them and come at them in front of the balsam trees. 24“And when you hear the sound of marching in the tops of the balsam trees, then you shall pay attention and act promptly, for at that time the LORD will have gone out before you to strike the army of the Philistines.” 25David did just as the LORD had commanded him, and struck down the Philistines from Geba as far as Gezer.\n\n2 Samuel 6\nPeril In Moving The Ark\n\n1Again David gathered together all the chosen men of Israel, thirty thousand. 2And David arose and went with all those who were with him to Baale-judah [Kiriath-jearim], to bring up from there [to Jerusalem] the ark of God which is called by the Name—the very Name of the LORD of hosts, who dwells enthroned above the cherubim. 3They placed the ark of God on a new cart and brought it out of the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Uzzah and Ahio, sons of Abinadab, were leading the new cart. 4So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the hill; and Ahio was walking in front of the ark. 5Meanwhile, David and all the house of Israel were celebrating and dancing before the LORD with all kinds of instruments made of fir or cypress wood, with lyres, harps, tambourines, castanets, and cymbals.\n\n6When they came to Nacon’s threshing floor, Uzzah reached out [with his hand] to the ark of God and took hold of it, because the oxen [stumbled and] nearly overturned it. 7And the anger of the LORD burned against Uzzah, and God struck him there for his irreverence; and he died there by the ark of God. 8David became angry and grieved and offended because of the LORD’S outburst against Uzzah, and that place has been called Perez-uzzah (outburst against Uzzah) to this day. 9So David was afraid of the LORD that day; and he said, “How can the ark of the LORD come to me?” 10David was unwilling to move the ark of the LORD into the City of David with him; instead he took it aside to the house of Obed-edom the Gittite. 11So the ark of the LORD remained in the house of Obed-edom the Gittite for three months, and the LORD blessed Obed-edom and all his household (family).\n\nThe Ark Is Brought to Jerusalem 12Now King David was told, “The LORD has blessed the house of Obed-edom and all that belongs to him, because of the ark of God.” So David went and brought up the ark of God from the house of Obed-edom into the City of David with rejoicing and gladness. 13And when those who were carrying the ark of the LORD [by its poles] had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fatling. 14And David was dancing before the LORD with great enthusiasm, and David was wearing a linen ephod [a priest’s upper garment]. 15So David and all the house of Israel were bringing the ark of the LORD up [to the City of David] with shouts [of joy] and with the sound of the trumpet.\n\n16Then, as the ark of the LORD came into the City of David, Michal, Saul’s daughter [David’s wife], looked down from the window above and saw King David leaping and dancing before the LORD; and she felt contempt for him in her heart [because she thought him undignified].\n\n17They brought in the ark of the LORD and set it in its place inside the tent which David had pitched for it; and David offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the LORD. 18When David had finished offering the burnt offerings and peace offerings, he blessed the people in the name of the LORD of hosts (armies), 19and distributed to all the people, the entire multitude of Israel, both to men and women, to each a [ring-shaped] loaf of bread, a cake of dates, and a cake of raisins. Then all the people departed, each to his house.\n\n20Then David returned to bless his household. But [his wife] Michal the daughter of Saul came out to meet David and said, “How glorious and distinguished was the king of Israel today, who uncovered himself and stripped [off his kingly robes] in the eyes of his servants’ maids like one of the riffraff who shamelessly uncovers himself!” 21So David said to Michal, “It was before the LORD [that I did this], who chose me above your father and all his house, to appoint me as ruler over Israel, the people of the LORD. Therefore I will celebrate [in pure enjoyment] before the LORD. 22“Yet I will demean myself even more than this, and will be humbled (abased) in my own sight [and yours, as I please], but by the maids whom you mentioned, by them I shall be held in honor.” 23Michal the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death.\n\n2 Samuel 7\nDavid Plans To Build A Temple\n\n1When King David lived in his house (palace) and the LORD had given him rest from all his surrounding enemies, 2the king said to Nathan the prophet, “See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells within tent curtains.” 3And Nathan said to the king, “Go, do everything that is in your heart, for the LORD is with you.”\n\n4But it happened that night that the word of the LORD came to Nathan, saying, 5“Go and tell My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD, “Should you be the one to build Me a house in which to dwell? 6For I have not dwelt in a house since the day I brought the sons (descendants) of Israel up from Egypt, even to this day; but I have been moving about in a tent, even in a tabernacle. 7“Wherever I have gone with all the Israelites, did I speak a word to any from the tribes of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd My people Israel, asking, ‘Why have you not built Me a house of cedar?’”’ God’s Covenant with David 8So now, say this to My servant David, ‘Thus says the LORD of hosts, I took you from the pasture, from following the sheep, to be ruler over My people Israel. 9I have been with you wherever you have gone, and have cut off all your enemies from before you; and I will make you a great name, like that of the great men of the earth. 10I will appoint a place for My people Israel and will plant them, so that they may live in a place of their own and not be disturbed again. The wicked will not afflict them again, as formerly, 11even from the day that I appointed judges over My people Israel; and I will give you rest from all your enemies. The LORD also declares to you that He will make a house (royal dynasty) for you. 12When your days are fulfilled and you lie down [in death] with your fathers (ancestors), I will raise up your descendant after you, who shall be born to you, and I will establish his kingdom. 13He [is the one who] shall build a house for My Name and My Presence, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever. 14I will be his Father, and he shall be My son. When he commits iniquity (wrongdoing), I will discipline him with the rod of men and with the strokes of the sons of man. 15But My lovingkindness and mercy will not depart from him, as I took it from Saul, whom I removed from before you. 16“Your house (royal dynasty) and your kingdom will endure forever before Me; your throne will be established forever.”’” 17Nathan spoke to David in accordance with all these words and all of this vision.\n\nDavid’s Prayer 18Then King David went in and sat [in prayer] before the LORD, and said, “Who am I, O Lord GOD, and what is my house (family), that You have brought me this far? 19Yet this was very insignificant in Your eyes, O Lord GOD, for You have spoken also of Your servant’s house (royal dynasty) in the distant future. And this is the law and custom of man, O Lord GOD. 20What more can David say to You? For You know (acknowledge, choose) Your servant, O Lord GOD. 21Because of Your word (promise), and in accordance with Your own heart, You have done all these great and astounding things to let Your servant know (understand). 22Therefore You are great, O Lord GOD; for there is none like You, and there is no God besides You, according to all that we have heard with our ears. 23What one nation on earth is like Your people Israel, whom God went to redeem for Himself as a people and to make a name for Himself, and to do great and awesome things for Yourself and for Your land, before Your people whom You have redeemed for Yourself from Egypt, from nations and their gods? 24You established for Yourself Your people Israel as Your people forever, and You, O LORD, have become their God. 25Now, O LORD God, confirm forever the word [of the covenant] that You have spoken in regard to Your servant and his house (royal dynasty); and do just as You have spoken, 26so that Your Name may be magnified forever, saying, ‘The LORD of hosts (armies) is God over Israel;’ and may the house (royal dynasty) of Your servant David be established before You. 27For You, O LORD of hosts, God of Israel, have revealed this to Your servant, saying, ‘I will build you a house (royal dynasty).’ For that reason Your servant has found courage to pray this prayer to You. 28And now, O Lord GOD, You are God, and Your words are truth, and You have promised this good thing to Your servant. 29“Therefore now, may it please You to bless the house (royal dynasty) of Your servant, so that it may continue forever before You; for You, O Lord GOD, have spoken it, and with Your blessing may the house of Your servant be blessed forever.”\n\n2 Samuel 8\nDavid’s Triumphs\n\n1Now it came about after this that David defeated the Philistines and subdued (humbled) them, and he took control of Metheg-ammah [the main city] from the hand of the Philistines.\n\n2He defeated Moab, and measured them with a length of rope, making them lie down on the ground; he measured two lengths to [choose those to] put to death, and one full length to [choose those to] be kept alive. And the [surviving] Moabites became servants to David, bringing tribute.\n\n3Then David defeated Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah, as he went to restore his power at the River [Euphrates]. 4David captured from him 1,700 horsemen and 20,000 foot soldiers. David also hamstrung all the chariot horses (making them lame), but reserved enough of them for a hundred chariots. 5When the Arameans (Syrians) of Damascus came to help Hadadezer, king of Zobah, David struck down 22,000 Arameans. 6Then David put garrisons among the Arameans in Damascus, and the Arameans became his servants and brought tribute. The LORD helped David wherever he went. 7David took the shields of gold that were carried by the servants of Hadadezer, and brought them to Jerusalem. 8And from Betah and Berothai, cities of Hadadezer, King David took an immense quantity of bronze.\n\n9When Toi king of Hamath heard about David’s defeat of all the forces of Hadadezer, 10Toi sent Joram his son to King David to greet and congratulate him for his battle and defeat of Hadadezer; for Hadadezer had been at war with Toi. Joram brought with him articles of silver, gold, and bronze [as gifts]. 11King David also dedicated these [gifts] to the LORD, along with the silver and gold that he had dedicated from all the nations which he subdued: 12from Aram (Syria), Moab, the Ammonites, the Philistines, and Amalek, and from the spoil of Hadadezer the son of Rehob, king of Zobah.\n\n13So David made a name for himself when he returned from killing 18,000 Arameans (Syrians) in the Valley of Salt. 14He put garrisons in Edom; in all Edom he put garrisons, and all the Edomites became servants to David. And the LORD helped him wherever he went.\n\n15So David reigned over all Israel, and continued to administer justice and righteousness for all his people. 16Joab the son of Zeruiah was [commander] over the army; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder (secretary); 17Zadok the son of Ahitub and Ahimelech the son of Abiathar were the [chief] priests, and Seraiah was the scribe; 18Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was [head] over both the Cherethites and Pelethites [the king’s bodyguards]; and David’s sons were chief [confidential] advisers (officials) [to the king].\n\n2 Samuel 9\nDavid’s Kindness To Mephibosheth\n\n1And David said, “Is there still anyone left of the house (family) of Saul to whom I may show kindness for Jonathan’s sake?” 2There was a servant of the house of Saul whose name was Ziba, so they called him to David. And the king said to him, “Are you Ziba?” He said, “I am your servant.” 3And the king said, “Is there no longer anyone left of the house (family) of Saul to whom I may show the goodness and graciousness of God?” Ziba replied to the king, “There is still a son of Jonathan, [one] whose feet are crippled.” 4So the king said to him, “Where is he?” And Ziba replied to the king, “He is in the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, in Lo-debar.” 5Then King David sent word and had him brought from the house of Machir the son of Ammiel, from Lo-debar. 6Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, came to David and fell face down and lay himself down [in respect]. David said, “Mephibosheth.” And he answered, “Here is your servant!” 7David said to him, “Do not be afraid, for I will certainly show you kindness for the sake of your father Jonathan, and will restore to you all the land of your grandfather Saul; and you shall always eat at my table.” 8Again Mephibosheth lay himself face down and said, “What is your servant, that you would be concerned for a dead dog like me?”\n\n9Then the king summoned Ziba, Saul’s servant, and said to him, “I have given your master’s grandson everything that belonged to Saul and to all his house (family). 10“You and your sons and your servants shall cultivate the land for him, and you shall bring in the produce, so that your master’s grandson may have food to eat; but Mephibosheth, your master’s grandson, shall always eat at my table.” Now Ziba had fifteen sons and twenty servants. 11Then Ziba said to the king, “Your servant will do according to everything that my lord the king commands.” So Mephibosheth ate at David’s table as one of the king’s sons. 12Mephibosheth had a young son whose name was Mica. And all who lived in Ziba’s house were servants to Mephibosheth. 13So Mephibosheth lived in Jerusalem, for he always ate at the king’s table. And he was lame in both feet.\n\n2 Samuel 10\nAmmon And Aram Defeated\n\n1Now it happened later that [Nahash] the king of the Ammonites died, and his son Hanun became king in his place. 2Then David said, “I will show kindness to Hanun the son of Nahash, just as his father did to me.” So David sent [a letter along with] some of his servants to console him in regard to his father’s death; and David’s servants came into the land of the Ammonites. 3But the princes of the Ammonites [were suspicious and] said to Hanun their lord, “Do you think that David is honoring your father because he has sent comforters to you? Has David not sent his servants to you in order to search the city, to spy it out and overthrow it?” 4So Hanun took David’s servants and shaved off half their beards, and cut off their robes in the middle as far as their hips, and sent them away. 5When David was informed, he sent [messengers] to meet them [before they reached Jerusalem], for the men were greatly ashamed and humiliated. And the king said, “Stay at Jericho until your beards grow, and then return.”\n\n6When the Ammonites saw that they had become an object of hatred to David, they sent word and hired the Arameans (Syrians) of Beth-rehob and the Arameans of Zobah, 20,000 foot soldiers, and the king of Maacah with 1,000 men, and the men of Tob with 12,000 men [to fight for them]. 7When David heard about it, he sent Joab and the entire army, the strong and brave men. 8The Ammonites came out and lined up for battle at the entrance of the [city] gate, but the Arameans of Zobah and Rehob and the men of Tob and Maacah were [stationed] by themselves in the field.\n\n9Now when Joab saw that the battlefront was against him in front and in the rear, he selected some of all the choice men in Israel and set them in battle formation to meet the Arameans (Syrians). 10But he placed the rest of the men in the hand of his brother Abishai, and he placed them in battle formation to meet the Ammonites. 11Joab said [to Abishai], “If the Arameans are too strong for me, then you shall help me; but if the Ammonites are too strong for you, I will come to help you. 12“Be courageous, and let us show ourselves courageous for the benefit of our people and the cities of our God. And may the LORD do what is good in His sight.” 13So Joab and the people who were with him approached the battle against the Arameans, and they fled before him. 14When the Ammonites saw that the Arameans had fled, they also fled before Abishai and entered the city. So Joab returned from battling against the Ammonites and came to Jerusalem.\n\n15When the Arameans saw that they were defeated by Israel, they gathered together. 16Hadadezer sent word and brought out the Arameans who were beyond the River [Euphrates]; and they came to Helam; and Shobach the commander of the army of Hadadezer led them. 17When David was informed, he gathered all Israel together and crossed the Jordan, and came to Helam. Then the Arameans assembled in battle formation to meet David and fought against him. 18But the Arameans fled before Israel, and David killed 700 Aramean charioteers and 40,000 horsemen, and struck Shobach the commander of their army, and he died there. 19When all the kings serving Hadadezer saw that they had been defeated by Israel, they made peace with Israel and served them. So the Arameans (Syrians) were afraid to help the Ammonites anymore.\n\n2 Samuel 11\nBathsheba, David’s Great Sin\n\n1Then it happened in the spring, at the time when the kings go out to battle, that David sent Joab and his servants with him, and all [the fighting men of] Israel, and they destroyed the Ammonites and besieged Rabbah. But David remained in Jerusalem.\n\n2One evening David got up from his couch and was walking on the [flat] roof of the king’s palace, and from there he saw a woman bathing; and she was very beautiful in appearance. 3David sent word and inquired about the woman. Someone said, “Is this not Bathsheba, the daughter of Eliam, the wife of Uriah the Hittite?” 4David sent messengers and took her. When she came to him, he lay with her. And when she was purified from her uncleanness, she returned to her house. 5The woman conceived; and she sent word and told David, “I am pregnant.”\n\n6Then David sent word to Joab, saying, “Send me Uriah the Hittite.” So Joab sent Uriah to David. 7When Uriah came to him, David asked him how Joab was, how the people were doing, and how the war was progressing. 8Then David said to Uriah, “Go down to your house, and wash your feet (spend time at home).” Uriah left the king’s palace, and a gift from the king was sent out after him. 9But Uriah slept at the entrance of the king’s palace with all the servants of his lord, and did not go down to his house. 10When they told David, “Uriah did not go down to his house,” David said to Uriah, “Have you not [just] come from a [long] journey? Why did you not go to your house?” 11Uriah said to David, “The ark and Israel and Judah are staying in huts (temporary shelters), and my lord Joab and the servants of my lord are camping in the open field. Should I go to my house to eat and drink and lie with my wife? By your life and the life of your soul, I will not do this thing.” 12Then David said to Uriah, “Stay here today as well, and tomorrow I will let you leave.” So Uriah remained in Jerusalem that day and the next. 13Now David called him [to dinner], and he ate and drank with him, so that he made Uriah drunk; in the evening he went out to lie on his bed with the servants of his lord, and [still] did not go down to his house.\n\n14In the morning David wrote a letter to Joab and sent it with Uriah. 15He wrote in the letter, “Put Uriah in the front line of the heaviest fighting and leave him, so that he may be struck down and die.” 16So it happened that as Joab was besieging the city, he assigned Uriah to the place where he knew the [enemy’s] valiant men were positioned. 17And the men of the city came out and fought against Joab, and some of the people among the servants of David fell; Uriah the Hittite also died. 18Then Joab sent word and informed David of all the events of the war. 19And he commanded the messenger, “When you have finished reporting all the events of the war to the king, 20then if the king becomes angry and he says to you, ‘Why did you go so near to the city to fight? Did you not know that they would shoot [arrows] from the wall? 21‘Who killed Abimelech the son of Jerubbesheth (Gideon)? Was it not a woman who threw an upper millstone on him from the wall so that he died at Thebez? Why did you go so near the wall?’ Then you shall say, ‘Your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.’”\n\n22So the messenger left, and he came and told David everything that Joab had sent him to report. 23The messenger said to David, “The men indeed prevailed against us and came out to us in the field, but we were on them and pushed them as far as the entrance of the [city] gate. 24“Then the archers shot at your servants from the wall. Some of the king’s servants are dead, and your servant Uriah the Hittite is also dead.” 25Then David said to the messenger, “Tell Joab this, ‘Do not let this thing disturb you, for the sword devours one [side] as well as another. Strengthen your battle against the city and overthrow it’; and so encourage Joab.”\n\n26When Uriah’s wife [Bathsheba] heard that her husband Uriah was dead, she mourned for her husband. 27And when the time of mourning was past, David sent word and had her brought to his house, and she became his wife and bore him a son. But the thing that David had done [with Bathsheba] was evil in the sight of the LORD.\n\n2 Samuel 12\nNathan Rebukes David\n\n1And the LORD sent Nathan [the prophet] to David. He came and said to him,\n“There were two men in a city, one rich and the other poor.\n2“The rich man had a very large number of flocks and herds,\n3But the poor man had nothing but one little ewe lamb\nWhich he had purchased and nourished;\nAnd it grew up together with him and his children.\nIt ate his food, drank from his cup, it lay in his arms,\nAnd was like a daughter to him.\n4“Now a traveler (visitor) came to the rich man,\nAnd to avoid taking one from his own flock or herd\nTo prepare [a meal] for the traveler who had come to him,\nHe took the poor man’s ewe lamb and prepared it for his guest.”\n\n5Then David’s anger burned intensely against the man, and he said to Nathan, “As the LORD lives, the man who has done this deserves to die. 6“He shall make restitution for the ewe lamb four times as much [as the lamb was worth], because he did this thing and had no compassion.”\n\n7Then Nathan said to David, “You are the man! Thus says the LORD, the God of Israel, ‘I anointed you as king over Israel, and I spared you from the hand of Saul. 8‘I also gave you your master’s house, and put your master’s wives into your care and under your protection, and I gave you the house (royal dynasty) of Israel and of Judah; and if that had been too little, I would have given you much more! 9‘Why have you despised the word of the LORD by doing evil in His sight? You have struck down Uriah the Hittite with the sword and have taken his wife to be your wife. You have killed him with the sword of the Ammonites. 10‘Now, therefore, the sword shall never depart from your house, because you have despised Me and have taken the wife of Uriah the Hittite to be your wife.’ 11Thus says the LORD, ‘Behold, I will stir up evil against you from your own household; and I will take your wives before your eyes and give them to your companion, and he will lie with your wives in broad daylight. 12‘Indeed you did it secretly, but I will do this thing before all Israel, and in broad daylight.’” 13David said to Nathan, “I have sinned against the LORD.” And Nathan said to David, “The LORD also has allowed your sin to pass [without further punishment]; you shall not die. 14“Nevertheless, because by this deed you have given [a great] opportunity to the enemies of the LORD to blaspheme [Him], the son that is born to you shall certainly die.” 15Then Nathan went [back] to his home.\n\nLoss of a Child 16> And the LORD struck the child that Uriah’s widow bore to David, and he was very sick. 17David therefore appealed to God for the child [to be healed]; and David fasted and went in and lay all night on the ground. 18The elders of his household stood by him [in the night] to lift him up from the ground, but he was unwilling [to get up] and would not eat food with them. 19Then it happened on the seventh day that the child died. David’s servants were afraid to tell him that the child was dead, for they said, “While the child was still alive, we spoke to him and he would not listen to our voices. How then can we tell him the child is dead, since he might harm himself [or us]?” 20But when David saw that his servants were whispering to one another, he realized that the child was dead. So David said to them, “Is the child dead?” And they said, “He is dead.” 21Then David got up from the ground, washed, anointed himself [with olive oil], changed his clothes, and went into the house of the LORD and worshiped. Then he came [back] to his own house, and when he asked, they set food before him and he ate.\n\n22Then his servants said to him, “What is this thing that you have done? While the child was alive you fasted and wept, but when the child died, you got up and ate food.” 23David said, “While the child was still alive, I fasted and wept; for I thought, ‘Who knows, the LORD may be gracious to me and the child may live.’ 24“But now he is dead; why should I [continue to] fast? Can I bring him back again? I will go to him [when I die], but he will not return to me.”\n\nSolomon Born 25David comforted his wife Bathsheba, and went to her and lay with her; and she gave birth to a son, and David named him Solomon. And the LORD loved the child; 26and He sent word through Nathan the prophet, and he named him Jedidiah (beloved of the LORD) for the sake of the LORD [who loved the child].\n\nWar Again 27Now Joab fought against Rabbah of the Ammonites and captured the royal city. 28Joab sent messengers to David and said, “I have fought against Rabbah; I have even taken the city of waters. 29“So now, assemble the rest of the men, and camp against the city and capture it, or I will take the city myself, and it will be named after me.” 30So David gathered all the men together and went to Rabbah, then fought against it and captured it. 31And he took the crown of their king from his head; it weighed a talent of gold, and [set in it was] a precious stone; and it was placed on David’s head. And he brought the spoil out of the city in great amounts. 32He also brought out the people who were there, and put them to [work with] the saws and sharp iron instruments and iron axes, and made them work at the brickkiln. And he did this to all the Ammonite cities. Then David and all the men returned to Jerusalem.\n\n2 Samuel 13\nAmnon And Tamar\n\n1It happened afterwards that Absalom the son of David had a beautiful sister whose name was Tamar, and Amnon [her half brother] the son of David was in love with her. 2Amnon was so frustrated because of his [half-] sister Tamar that he made himself sick, for she was a virgin, and Amnon thought it impossible for him to do anything to her. 3But Amnon had a friend whose name was Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother; and Jonadab was a very shrewd (cunning) man. 4He said to Amnon, “Why are you, the king’s son, so depressed morning after morning? Will you not tell me?” And Amnon said to him, “I am in love with Tamar, my [half-] brother Absalom’s sister.” 5Jonadab said to him, “Go to bed and pretend you are sick; and when your father [David] comes to see you, say to him, ‘Just let my sister Tamar come and serve me food, and let her prepare it in my sight, so that I may see it and eat it from her hand.’” 6So Amnon lay down and pretended to be sick; and when the king came to see him, Amnon said to the king, “Please let my sister Tamar come and make me a couple of cakes in my sight, so that I may eat from her hand.”\n\n7Then David sent word to the house for Tamar, saying, “Go now to your brother Amnon’s house, and prepare some food for him.” 8So Tamar went to her brother Amnon’s house, and he was in bed. And she took dough and kneaded it, and made cakes in his sight, and baked them. 9She took the pan and dished them out before him, but he refused to eat. And Amnon said, “Have everyone leave me.” So everyone left him [except Tamar]. 10Then Amnon said to Tamar, “Bring the food into the bedroom, so that I may eat from your hand.” So Tamar took the cakes she had made and brought them into the bedroom to her [half-] brother Amnon. 11When she brought them to him to eat, he took hold of her and said, “Come, lie with me, my sister.” 12She replied, “No, my brother! Do not violate me, for such a thing is not done in Israel; do not do this disgraceful thing! 13“As for me, how could I get rid of my shame and disgrace? And you, you will be considered one of the fools in Israel. So now, just speak to the king [about taking me as your wife], for he will not withhold me from you.” 14But he would not listen to her; and since he was stronger than she, he violated her and lay with her.\n\n15Then Amnon became extremely hateful toward her, for his hatred toward her was greater than the love which he had for her. And Amnon said to her, “Get up and get out!” 16But she said, “No, because this wrong of sending me away is worse than the other that you have done to me!” But he would not listen to her. 17Instead, he called his young man who was his personal servant and said, “Now throw this woman out of my presence and bolt the door behind her.” 18Now Tamar was wearing a [long-sleeved] robe of various colors; for that is how the virgin daughters of the king dressed themselves in robes. Then Amnon’s personal servant took her out and bolted the door behind her. 19So Tamar put dust on her head [in grief] and tore the long-sleeved robe which she had on, and she put her hand on her head and went away crying out [for help].\n\n20So her brother Absalom said to her, “Has your brother Amnon been with you? But now keep silent, my sister; he is your brother; do not take this matter to heart.” So Tamar remained secluded in her brother Absalom’s house. 21Now when King David heard about all these things, he was very angry [but failed to take any action]. 22But Absalom did not speak to Amnon either good or bad; for Absalom hated Amnon because he had violated his sister Tamar.\n\n23Now it came about after two full years that Absalom had sheepshearers at Baal-hazor near Ephraim, and Absalom invited all the king’s sons [to a party]. Absalom Avenges Tamar 24Absalom came to [his father] the king and said, “Behold, your servant has sheepshearers; please let the king and his servants go with your servant.” 25But the king said to Absalom, “No, my son, we should not all go, for we will be a burden to you.” Although Absalom [strongly] urged David, still he would not go, but he gave him his blessing. 26Then Absalom said, “If not, then at least let my brother Amnon go with us.” And the king said to him, “Why should he go with you?” 27But Absalom urged him [again], and he let Amnon and all the king’s sons go with him.\n\n28Now Absalom commanded his servants, “Notice carefully, when Amnon’s heart is joyous with wine, and when I say to you, ‘Strike Amnon,’ then kill him. Do not be afraid; have I not commanded you myself [and in doing so have I not taken full responsibility for his death]? Be courageous and brave.” 29So the servants of Absalom did to Amnon just as Absalom had commanded. Then all the king’s sons got up, and every man mounted his mule and fled.\n\n30Now it happened while they were on the way [back home], that the [exaggerated] report came to David, “Absalom has killed all the king’s sons, and not one of them is left.” 31Then the king stood and tore his clothes and lay on the ground [in mourning]; and all his servants were standing by with their clothes torn. 32But Jonadab the son of Shimeah, David’s brother, responded, “Do not let my lord assume that all the king’s sons have been put to death; for only Amnon is dead. This act of revenge has been on Absalom’s mind since the day Amnon violated his sister Tamar. 33“So now, do not let my lord the king take the report to heart that all the king’s sons are dead; for Amnon alone is dead.”\n\n34Now Absalom fled. And the young man who kept watch looked up, and behold, many people were coming from the road behind him by the side of the mountain. 35And Jonadab said to the king, “Look, the king’s sons are coming. It has turned out just as your servant said.” 36And when he finished speaking, the king’s sons came, and they raised their voices and wept; and the king and all his servants also wept very bitterly.\n\n37But Absalom fled and went to [his mother’s father] Talmai the son of Ammihud, king of Geshur. And David mourned for his son every day. 38So Absalom fled and went to Geshur, and was there for three years. 39And the heart of King David longed to go to Absalom; for he was comforted regarding Amnon, since he was dead.\n\n2 Samuel 14\nThe Woman Of Tekoa\n\n1Now Joab the son of Zeruiah knew that the king’s heart longed for Absalom. 2So Joab sent word to Tekoa and had a wise woman brought from there and told her, “Please pretend to be a mourner, and put on mourning clothes, and do not anoint yourself with oil, but act like a woman who has for many days been in mourning for the dead. 3“Then go to the king and speak to him in this way.” So Joab told her what to say.\n\n4When the woman of Tekoa spoke to the king, she bowed with her face to the ground and lay herself down, and said, “Help, O king.” 5The king asked her, “What is the matter?” She said, “Truly I am a widow; my husband is dead. 6Your maidservant had two sons, but the two of them struggled and fought in the field. There was no one to separate them, so one struck the other and killed him. 7“Now behold, the entire family has risen against your maidservant, and they say, ‘Hand over the one who killed his brother, so that we may put him to death [to pay] for the life of his brother whom he killed and destroy the heir also.’ By doing this they will extinguish my coal that is left, leaving my husband without a name or a remnant (heir) on the face of the earth.”\n\n8Then David said to the woman, “Go to your home, and I will give orders concerning you.” 9The woman of Tekoa said to the king, “My lord, O king, the guilt is on me and on my father’s house, but the king and his throne are guiltless.” 10The king said, “If anyone speaks to you [about this matter], bring him to me [for judgment], and he will not touch you again.” 11Then she said, “Please let the king remember the LORD your God, so that the avenger of blood will not continue to destroy, otherwise they will destroy my son.” And David said, “As the LORD lives, not a single hair [from the head] of your son shall fall to the ground.”\n\n12Then the woman said, “Please let your maidservant speak one more word to my lord the king.” He said, “Speak.” 13The woman said, “Now why have you planned such a thing against God’s people? For in speaking this word the king is like a guilty man, in that the king does not bring back his banished one. 14For we will certainly die and are like water that is spilled on the ground and cannot be gathered up again. Yet God does not [simply] take away life, but devises plans so that the one who is banished is not driven away from Him. 15Now I came to speak of this matter to my lord the king because the people have made me afraid. So your maidservant thought, ‘I will just speak to the king; perhaps the king will do what his maidservant requests. 16‘For the king will hear and save his maidservant from the hand of the man who would destroy me and my son together from the inheritance of God.’ 17“Then your maidservant said, ‘Please let the word of my lord the king be comforting, for my lord the king is as the angel of God to discern good and evil. May the LORD your God be with you.’”\n\n18Then the king answered and said to the woman, “Do not hide from me anything that I ask you.” And the woman said, “Let my lord the king please speak.” 19The king said, “Is the hand of Joab with you in all of this?” And the woman answered, “As your soul lives, my lord the king, no one can turn to the right or to the left from anything that my lord the king has said. Indeed, it was your servant Joab who commanded me; he put all these words in the mouth of your maidservant. 20“In order to change the appearance of things [between Absalom and you, his father] your servant Joab did this thing. But my lord has wisdom like the wisdom of the angel of God, to know everything that is in the earth.”\n\nAbsalom Is Recalled 21Then the king said to Joab, “Listen, I will most certainly do this thing; now go, bring back the young man Absalom.” 22Joab bowed his face toward the ground and lay himself down and blessed the king. Then Joab said, “Today your servant knows that I have found favor in your sight, my lord, O king, in that the king has done the request of his servant.” 23So Joab got up, went to Geshur, and brought Absalom to Jerusalem. 24However, the king said, “Let him go to his own house, and do not let him see my face.” So Absalom went to his own house and did not see the king’s face.\n\n25Now in all Israel there was no man as handsome as Absalom, so highly praised [for that]; from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head there was no blemish in him. 26When he cut the hair of his head (for at the end of each year he cut it, because its weight was heavy on him) he weighed the hair of his head at 200 shekels by the king’s weight. 27To Absalom were born three sons and one daughter whose name was Tamar; she was a beautiful woman.\n\n28Absalom lived two full years in Jerusalem, without seeing the king’s face. 29So Absalom sent for Joab, to send him to the king, but he would not come to him; even when he sent again a second time, he [still] would not come. 30Therefore Absalom said to his servants, “See, Joab’s property is near mine, and he has barley there; go and set it on fire.” So Absalom’s servants set the field on fire. 31Then Joab took action and went to Absalom at his house and said to him, “Why did your servants set my field on fire?” 32Absalom answered Joab, “I sent for you, saying, ‘Come here, so that I may send you to the king to ask, “Why have I come [back] from Geshur? It would be better for me to still be there.”’ Now then, let me see the king’s face, and if there is guilt in me, let him put me to death.” 33So Joab came to the king and told him. Then David called for Absalom, and he came to the king and bowed his face to the ground before the king; and the king kissed Absalom.\n\n2 Samuel 15\nAbsalom’s Conspiracy\n\n1After this, Absalom provided for himself a chariot and horses, and fifty men as runners before him. 2He would get up early and stand beside the road to the gate [of the city, where court was held]; and when any man who had a dispute came to the king for judgment, Absalom would call to him, “From what city are you?” And he would say, “Your servant is from one of the tribes of Israel.” 3Then Absalom would say to him, “See, your claims are good and right, but there is no man appointed as the king’s agent to listen to you.” 4Moreover Absalom would say, “Oh, that I were appointed judge in the land! Then every man who had a dispute could come to me and I would get justice for him.” 5And whenever a man approached to bow down before him, he would put out his hand, take hold of him, and kiss him. 6This is how Absalom dealt with everyone in Israel who came to the king for judgment. So Absalom stole the hearts of the men of Israel.\n\n7And after four years, Absalom said to the king, “Please let me go and pay my vow which I have made to the LORD at Hebron [my birthplace]. 8“For your servant made a vow while I lived at Geshur in Aram (Syria), ‘If the LORD will in fact bring me back to Jerusalem, then I will serve the Lord [by offering a sacrifice of thanksgiving].’” 9And [David] the king said to him, “Go in peace.” So he arose and went to Hebron. 10But Absalom sent spies throughout all the tribes of Israel, saying, “As soon as you hear the sound of the trumpet, you shall say, ‘Absalom is king in Hebron.’” 11Then two hundred men from Jerusalem who were invited [as guests to his sacrificial feast] went with Absalom. They went innocently and knew nothing [about his plan against David]. 12And Absalom sent for Ahithophel the Gilonite, David’s counselor, from his city Giloh, while he was offering sacrifices. And the conspiracy grew strong, for the people with Absalom increased continually.\n\nDavid Flees Jerusalem 13Then a messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the men of Israel are with Absalom.” 14David said to all his servants who were with him at Jerusalem, “Arise, let us flee, or none of us will escape from Absalom! Go in haste, or he will overtake us quickly and bring disaster on us and strike the city with the edge of the sword.” 15The king’s servants said to him, “Listen, your servants are ready to do whatever my lord the king decides.” 16So the king left, and all his household with him. But the king left behind ten women who were concubines to take care of the house (palace). 17The king left, and all the people with him, and they stopped at the last house. 18All of David’s servants passed on beside him, and all the Cherethites, Pelethites and the Gittites, six hundred men who had come with him from Gath, passed on before the king.\n\n19Then the king said to Ittai the Gittite, “Why should you go with us, too? Go back and stay with the king [of your own country], for you are a foreigner and an exile as well; return to your own place. 20“You came only yesterday, so should I make you wander with us today while I go where I will? Return and take your brothers back with you also. May lovingkindness and faithfulness be with you.” 21But Ittai answered the king, “As the LORD lives, and as my lord the king lives, most certainly wherever my lord the king may be, whether for death or life, there will your servant be also.” 22So David said to Ittai, “Go on and cross over [the Brook Kidron].” So Ittai the Gittite crossed over with all his men and all the little ones who were with him. 23While all the country was weeping with a loud voice, all the people crossed over. The king also crossed the Brook Kidron, and all the people went on toward the way of the wilderness [that lies between Jerusalem and the Jordan River].\n\n24Now Zadok also came, and all the Levites with him carrying the ark of the covenant of God. And they set down the ark of God, and Abiathar [the priest] came up [and officiated] until all the people had finished passing from the city. 25Then the king told Zadok, “Take the ark of God back to [its rightful place in] the city [of Jerusalem, the capital]. If I find favor in the LORD’S sight, He will bring me back again and let me see both it and His dwelling place (habitation). 26“But if He should say, ‘I have no delight in you,’ then here I am; let Him do to me what seems good to Him.” 27The king also said to Zadok the priest, “Are you not a seer? Return to the city in peace [you and Abiathar], and your two sons with you, your son Ahimaaz and Jonathan the son of Abiathar. 28“See, I am going to wait at the fords [of the Jordan] in the wilderness until word comes from you to inform me.” 29So Zadok and Abiathar brought the ark of God back to Jerusalem, and they stayed there.\n\n30And David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot [in despair]. And all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went. 31David was told, “Ahithophel [your counselor] is among the conspirators with Absalom.” David said, “O LORD, I pray You, turn Ahithophel’s counsel into foolishness.”\n\n32It happened when David came to the summit [of the Mount of Olives], where he worshiped God, behold, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his tunic torn and dust on his head [as if in mourning]. 33David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me. 34But if you return to the city, and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in the past, so I will be your servant now;’ then you can thwart (make useless) the advice of Ahithophel for me. 35Are not Zadok and Abiathar the priests with you there? So it shall be that every word you hear from the king’s palace, you shall report it to them. 36“Their two sons are there with them, Ahimaaz, Zadok’s son and Jonathan, Abiathar’s son; and by them you shall send to me everything that you hear.” 37So Hushai, David’s friend, returned to the city, and [at about the same time] Absalom came into Jerusalem.\n\n2 Samuel 16\nZiba, A False Servant\n\n1When David was a little past the summit [of the Mount of Olives], behold, Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, met him with a team of saddled donkeys, and on them were two hundred loaves of bread, a hundred clusters of raisins, a hundred summer fruits, and a jug of wine. 2The king said to Ziba, “Why do you have these?” Ziba said, “The donkeys are for the king’s household (family) to ride on, the bread and summer fruit for the young men to eat, and the wine is for anyone to drink who becomes weary in the wilderness.” 3Then the king said, “And where is your master’s son [Mephibosheth]?” Ziba said to the king, “Behold, he remains in Jerusalem, for he said, ‘Today the house of Israel will give me back the kingdom of my father.’” 4Then the king said to Ziba, “Behold, everything that belonged to Mephibosheth is [now] yours.” Ziba said, “I bow down [in honor and gratitude]; let me find favor in your sight, O my lord the king.”\n\nDavid Is Cursed 5When King David came to Bahurim, a man named Shimei, the son of Gera, came out from there. He was of the family of Saul’s household and he was cursing continually as he came out. 6He threw stones at David and at all the servants of King David; yet all the people and all the warriors remained on his right and on his left. 7This is what Shimei said as he cursed: “Get out, get out, you man of bloodshed, you worthless and useless man! 8“The LORD has returned upon you all the bloodshed of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the LORD has given the kingdom into the hands of Absalom your son. And behold, you are caught in your own evil, for you are a man of bloodshed!”\n\n9Then Abishai [David’s nephew], the son of Zeruiah, said to the king, “Why should this dead dog (despicable person) curse my lord the king? Let me go over and take off his head.” 10But the king said, “What business is this of yours, O sons of Zeruiah? If Shimei is cursing because the LORD said to him, ‘Curse David,’ then who should say, ‘Why have you done so?’” 11Then David said to Abishai and to all his servants, “Look, my son [Absalom] who came from my own body, is seeking my life; how much more [reason] now [does] this Benjamite [have to curse me]? Let him alone and let him curse, for [it could be that] the LORD has told him [to do it]. 12“Perhaps the LORD will look on the wrong done to me [by Shimei, if he is acting on his own]; and [in that case perhaps] the Lord will this day return good to me in place of his cursing.” 13So David and his men went on the road; and Shimei went along on the hillside close beside David and cursed as he went and threw stones and dust at him. 14The king and all the people who were with him arrived [at the Jordan River] weary, and he refreshed himself there.\n\nAbsalom Enters Jerusalem 15Then Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel, entered Jerusalem, and Ahithophel with him. 16Now it happened when Hushai the Archite, David’s friend, came to Absalom, Hushai said to him, “Long live the king! Long live the king!” 17Absalom said to Hushai, “Is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend?” 18Hushai said to Absalom, “No! For whomever the LORD and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen [as king], I will be his, and I will remain with him. 19“Besides, whom should I serve? Should I not serve in the presence of David’s son? As I have served in your father’s presence, so I shall serve in your presence.”\n\n20Then Absalom said to Ahithophel, “Give me your advice. What should we do?” 21Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Go in to your father’s concubines, whom he has left behind to take care of the house; then all Israel will hear that you have made yourself odious to your father. Then the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened [by your boldness and audacity].” 22So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof [of the king’s palace], and Absalom went in to his father’s concubines in the sight of all Israel. 23The advice of Ahithophel, which he gave in those days, was as if a man had consulted the word of God; that is how all Ahithophel’s counsel was regarded by both David and Absalom.\n\n2 Samuel 17\nHushai’s Counsel\n\n1Then, Ahithophel said to Absalom, “Please let me choose 12,000 men, and I will set out and pursue David tonight. 2I will strike while he is weary and exhausted, and terrify him; and all the people with him will flee [in terror]. Then I will attack the king alone, 3and I will bring all the people [who follow David] back to you. The return of everyone depends on the [death of the] man you are seeking; then all the people will be at peace [and accept you as king].” 4So the plan pleased Absalom and all the elders of Israel.\n\n5Nevertheless, Absalom said, “Now call Hushai the Archite also, and let us hear what he has to say.” 6When Hushai came to Absalom, Absalom said to him, “Ahithophel has advised this [plan of action]. Should we do what he says? If not, you speak [and explain why not].” 7So Hushai said to Absalom, “Ahithophel has not given good advice this time.” 8And Hushai said, “You know your father and his men, that they are brave men, and they are enraged and fierce, like a bear deprived of her cubs in the field. Your father is a [shrewd] man of war, and will not spend the night with the people [knowing that you seek his life]. 9Behold, he has hidden himself [even] now in one of the ravines or in another place; and when some of your troops fall at the first attack, whoever hears about it will say, ‘There has been a defeat among the people who follow Absalom.’ 10And even the one who is brave, whose heart is like the heart of a lion, will completely lose heart and melt away; for all Israel knows that your father is a mighty man, and that those who are with him are brave men. 11But I advise that all [the men of] Israel be summoned to you, from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], like the sand that is by the sea in abundance, and that you personally go into battle. 12So shall we come upon David in one of the places where he can be found, and we will fall on him as the dew falls [unseen and unheard] on the ground; and of him and of all the men who are with him, not even one will be left. 13“If he retreats into a city, then all Israel shall bring ropes to that city, and we will drag it into the ravine until not even a pebble [of it] is found there.” 14Then Absalom and all the men of Israel said, “The advice of Hushai the Archite is better than that of Ahithophel.” For the LORD had ordained to thwart the good advice of Ahithophel, so that the LORD could bring disaster upon Absalom.\n\nHushai’s Warning Saves David 15Then Hushai said to Zadok and Abiathar the priests, “This is the advice that Ahithophel gave to Absalom and the elders of Israel, and this is the advice that I have given. 16“Now then, send word quickly and tell David, ‘Do not spend the night at the fords [on the west side of the Jordan] in the wilderness, but by all means cross over [to the east side of the river], or else the king and all the people with him will be destroyed [if Ahithophel is allowed by Absalom to lead an attack].’” 17Now Jonathan and Ahimaaz [the priests’ sons] were staying at En-rogel, and a maidservant [appearing to go for water] would go and tell them [what was happening], and they would go [secretly] and inform King David; for they could not [allow themselves to] be seen coming into the city [of Jerusalem]. 18But a boy saw them and told Absalom; so the two of them left quickly and came to the house of a man in Bahurim, who had a well in his courtyard, and [with his permission] they went down into it. 19And the woman [of the house] took a covering and spread it over the mouth of the well and scattered grain on it; so nothing was discovered. 20Then Absalom’s servants came to the woman at the house and asked, “Where are Ahimaaz and Jonathan?” And the woman said to them, “They have crossed over the brook.” When they searched and could not find them, they returned to Jerusalem.\n\n21After they left, Jonathan and Ahimaaz came up out of the well and went and informed King David, and said to David, “Arise and cross over the Jordan River quickly, for Ahithophel has advised [an attack] against you.” 22Then David and all the people who were with him departed and crossed over the Jordan. By daybreak, not even one was left who had not crossed the Jordan.\n\n23Now when Ahithophel saw that his advice had not been followed, he saddled his donkey and set out and went to his home, to his city. Then he put his household in order, and hanged himself. So he died and was buried in the tomb of his father.\n\n24Then David came to Mahanaim. And Absalom crossed over the Jordan, he and all the men of Israel with him. 25Absalom put Amasa in command of the army instead of Joab. Now Amasa was the son of a man named Ithra the Israelite, who had married Abigail the daughter of Nahash, [the half sister of David and] the sister of Zeruiah, Joab’s mother. 26So Israel and Absalom camped in the land of Gilead.\n\n27When David came to Mahanaim, Shobi the son of Nahash from Rabbah of the Ammonites, and Machir the son of Ammiel from Lo-debar, and Barzillai the Gileadite from Rogelim 28brought beds, basins, pottery, wheat, barley, flour, roasted grain, broad beans, lentils, and [other] roasted grain, 29honey, cream, sheep, and cheese of the herd, for David and the people who were with him, to eat; for they said, “The people are hungry and weary and thirsty in the wilderness.”\n\n2 Samuel 18\nAbsalom’s Death\n\n1David numbered the men who were with him and set over them commanders of thousands and commanders of hundreds. 2Then David sent the army out, a third under the command of Joab, a third under Abishai the son of Zeruiah, Joab’s brother, and a third under the command of Ittai the Gittite. And the king said to the men, “I myself will certainly go out [to fight] with you.” 3But the men said, “You should not go out [to battle with us]. For if in fact we retreat, they will not care about us; even if half of us die, they will not care about us. But you are worth ten thousand of us. So now it is better that you be ready to help us from the city [of Mahanaim].” 4Then the king said to them, “I will do whatever seems best to you.” So the king stood beside the gate [of Mahanaim], and all the army went out in groups of hundreds and of thousands. 5The king commanded Joab and Abishai and Ittai, saying, “Deal gently with the young man Absalom for my sake.” And all the men heard when the king gave orders to all the commanders about Absalom.\n\n6So the men went out into the field against Israel, and the battle was fought in the forest of Ephraim. 7The men of Israel [who supported Absalom] were defeated there by the men of David, and a great slaughter took place there that day, 20,000 men. 8For the battle there was spread out over the surface of the entire countryside, and the [hazards of the] forest devoured more men that day than did the sword.\n\n9Now Absalom met the servants of David. Absalom was riding on his mule, and the mule went under the thick branches of a massive tree, and his head was caught in [the thick branches of] the tree; and he was left hanging [in midair] between heaven and earth, while the mule that had been under him kept going. 10A certain man saw it and informed Joab, saying, “I saw Absalom hanging in a tree.” 11Joab said to the man who informed him, “You saw him! Why then did you not strike him there to the ground? I would have given you ten pieces of silver and a belt.” 12The man told Joab, “Even if I were to feel the weight of a thousand pieces of silver in my hands, I would not put out my hand against the king’s son; for we all heard the king command you, Abishai, and Ittai, saying, ‘Protect the young man Absalom, for my sake.’ 13“Otherwise, if I had acted treacherously against his life (for nothing is hidden from the king) you yourself would have taken sides against me.” 14Joab said, “I will not waste time with you.” So he took three spears in his hand and thrust them through the heart of Absalom while he was still alive [and caught] in the midst of the tree. 15And ten young men, Joab’s armor bearers, surrounded and struck Absalom and killed him.\n\n16Then Joab blew the trumpet [to signal the end of the combat], and the men returned from pursuing Israel, for Joab held them back. 17They took [down the body of] Absalom and threw him into a deep pit in the forest and set up a huge mound of stones over him. Then all Israel fled, everyone to his own tent. 18Now Absalom in his lifetime had taken and set up for himself a memorial pillar which is in the King’s Valley, for he said, “I have no son to keep my name in remembrance.” He named the memorial pillar after himself, and to this day it is called Absalom’s Monument.\n\nDavid Is Grief-stricken 19Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok, said, “Let me run and bring the king news that the LORD has vindicated him by rescuing him from [the power of] his enemies.” 20But Joab told him, “You are not the man to carry news [to King David] today, but you shall carry news another day. On this day you shall carry no news, because the king’s son is dead.” 21Then Joab said to the Cushite (Ethiopian), “Go, tell the king what you have seen.” And the Cushite bowed to Joab and ran. 22Then Ahimaaz the son of Zadok said again to Joab, “But whatever happens, please let me also run after the Cushite.” Joab said, “Why should you run, my son, seeing you will have no messenger’s reward for going [because you have only bad news]?” 23“But whatever happens, Let me run.” So Joab said to him, “Run.” Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of the plain [of the Jordan River] and outran the Cushite.\n\n24Now David was sitting between the two gates; and the lookout went up to the roof of the gate by the wall, and when he raised his eyes and looked, he saw a man running alone. 25The lookout called down and told the king. The king said, “If he is alone, he has good news to tell.” And he came nearer and nearer. 26Then the lookout saw another man running, and he called to the gatekeeper and said, “Look, another man running alone.” The king said, “He also is bringing good news.” 27The lookout said, “I think the man in front runs like Ahimaaz the son of Zadok.” The king said, “He is a good man and is coming with good news.”\n\n28And Ahimaaz called out and said to the king, “All is well.” And he bowed before the king with his face to the ground and said, “Blessed be the LORD your God, who has handed over the men who lifted up their hands [to fight] against my lord the king.” 29The king asked, “Is the young man Absalom safe?” Ahimaaz answered, “When Joab sent the king’s servant, and your servant, I saw a great turmoil, but I do not know what it was about.” 30The king told him, “Step aside; stand here.” And he stepped aside and stood still.\n\n31Behold, the Cushite (Ethiopian) arrived, and said, “Let my lord the king receive good news, for the LORD has vindicated you today by rescuing you from the hand (power) of all those who stood against you.” 32The king asked the Cushite, “Is the young man Absalom [my son] safe?” The Cushite replied, “May the enemies of my lord the king, and all those who rise against you to do evil, be [dead] like that young man is.”\n\n33The king was deeply moved and went to the upper room over the gate and wept [in sorrow]. And this is what he said as he walked: “O my son Absalom, my son, my son Absalom! How I wish that I had died instead of you, O Absalom, my son, my son!”\n\n2 Samuel 19\nJoab Reproves David’s Lament\n\n1It was told to Joab, “Behold, the king is weeping and mourning for Absalom.” 2So the victory on that day was turned into mourning for all the people, for the people heard it said on that day, “The king grieves for his son.” 3The people stole into the city [of Mahanaim] that day, as people who are humiliated and ashamed steal away when they retreat in battle. 4But the king covered his face and cried out with a loud voice, “O my son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!” 5Then Joab came into the house to the king and said, “Today you have put all your servants to shame who this day have saved your life and the lives of your sons and your daughters, and the lives of your wives and concubines. 6For you love those who hate you and hate those who love you. For you have shown today that commanders and servants are nothing to you; for today I know that if Absalom had lived and all the rest of us had died today, then you would be pleased. 7“So now stand up, go out and speak kindly and encouragingly to your servants; for I swear by the LORD that if you do not go out, not a man will stay with you tonight. And this will be worse for you than all the evil that has come upon you from your youth until now.” David Restored as King 8Then the king stood and sat at the gate [of Mahanaim]. And they told all the people, “The king is sitting at the gate,” and all the people came before the king.\n\nBut Israel [Absalom’s troops] had fled, every man to his tent. 9All the people were quarreling throughout the tribes of Israel, saying, “The king rescued us from the hands of our enemies, and he saved us from the hands of the Philistines, but now he has fled out of the land from Absalom. 10“And Absalom, whom we anointed over us, has died in battle. So now, why are you [leaders] doing nothing about bringing back the king?”\n\n11Then King David sent word to Zadok and to Abiathar the priests, saying, “Say to the elders of Judah, ‘Why are you the last to bring the king back to his house [in Jerusalem], since the word of all Israel has come to the king, and to his house? 12‘You are my brothers (relatives, relations); you are my bone and my flesh. Why then are you the last to bring back the king?’ 13“Say to Amasa [the commander of Absalom’s troops], ‘Are you not my bone and my flesh? May God do so to me, and more also, if you will not be commander of my army from now on in place of Joab.’” 14In this way he changed the hearts of all the men of Judah as one man, so they sent word to the king, “Return, you and all your servants.” 15So David returned and came to the Jordan. And [supporters from] Judah came to Gilgal to meet the king, to escort him across the Jordan.\n\n16Then Shimei the son of Gera, a Benjamite of Bahurim, hurried and came down with the men [from the tribe of] of Judah to meet King David, 17and a thousand men [from the tribe] of Benjamin with him. And Ziba, the servant of the house of Saul, and his fifteen sons and twenty servants with him, rushed down to the Jordan before the king. 18Then they [repeatedly] crossed the ford to bring over the king’s household (family), and to do what pleased him. And Shimei the son of Gera fell down before the king as he was about to cross the Jordan, 19and said to the king, “Let not my lord consider me guilty, nor remember what your servant did wrong on the day my lord the king left Jerusalem, so that the king would take it to heart. 20“For your servant knows that I have sinned; therefore, behold, I have come today, the first of all the house of Joseph to come down to meet my lord the king.” 21But Abishai the son of Zeruiah said, “Should not Shimei be put to death for this, because he cursed the LORD’S anointed?” 22David said, “What business is this of yours, you sons of Zeruiah, that you should be an adversary to me today? Should anyone be put to death in Israel today? For do I not know that today I am king over Israel?” 23Therefore the king said to Shimei, “You shall not be put to death.” And so the king gave him his promise.\n\n24Then Mephibosheth the [grand]son of Saul came down to meet the king, but he had not cared for his feet, nor trimmed his mustache, nor washed his clothes from the day the king left until the day he returned in peace and safety. 25And when he came to Jerusalem to meet the king, the king said to him, “Why did you not go with me, Mephibosheth?” 26He said, “My lord the king, my servant [Ziba] betrayed me; for I said, ‘Saddle a donkey for me so that I may ride on it and go with the king,’ for your servant is lame [but he took the donkeys and left without me]. 27Further, he has slandered your servant to my lord the king; but my lord the king is like the angel of God; so do what is good in your eyes. 28“For were not all of my father’s household (family) nothing but dead men before my lord the king; yet you set your servant among those who ate at your own table. So what right do I still have to cry out anymore to the king [for help]?” 29The king said to him, “Why speak anymore of your affairs? I have said, ‘You and Ziba shall divide the land.’” 30Mephibosheth said to the king, “Let him even take it all, since my lord the king has returned to his own house in safety and peace.”\n\n31Now Barzillai the Gileadite came down from Rogelim and went on to the Jordan with the king to escort him over the Jordan. 32Barzillai was a very old man, eighty years old; and he had provided the king with food while he stayed at Mahanaim, for he was a very great and wealthy man. 33The king said to Barzillai, “Cross over with me and I will provide for you in Jerusalem with me.” 34But Barzillai said to the king, “How much longer have I to live, that I should go up with the king to Jerusalem? 35I am this day eighty years old. Can I [be useful to advise you to] discern between good and bad? Can your servant taste what I eat or drink? Can I still hear the voices of singing men and women? Why then should your servant be an added burden to my lord the king? 36Your servant would merely cross over the Jordan with the king. Why should the king compensate me with this reward? 37“Please let your servant return, so that I may die in my own city [and be buried] by the grave of my father and mother. But here is your servant Chimham [my son]; let him cross over with my lord the king, and do for him what seems good to you.” 38The king answered, “Chimham shall cross over with me, and I will do for him what seems good to you; and whatever you ask of me, I will do for you.” 39So all the people crossed over the Jordan. When the king had crossed over, he kissed Barzillai and blessed him, and he returned to his place.\n\n40Then the king went on to Gilgal, and Chimham went on with him; and all the people of Judah and also half the people of Israel accompanied the king. 41And all the men of Israel came to the king and said to him, “Why have our brothers (relatives), the men [from the tribe] of Judah, stolen you away and brought the king and his household and all David’s men with him over the Jordan [instead of waiting for us to arrive]?” 42Then all the men of Judah answered the men of Israel, “Because the king is a close relative to us. So why then are you angry about this matter? Have we eaten at all at the king’s expense? Or has anything been taken for us?” 43Then the men of Israel answered the men of Judah, “We have ten [tribes’] shares in the king, and we have more claim on David than you. Why then did you treat us with contempt and ignore us [by rushing ahead]? Were we not the first to speak of bringing back our king?” But the words of the men of Judah were harsher than those of the men of Israel.\n\n2 Samuel 20\nSheba’s Revolt\n\n1There happened to be there a worthless and wicked man named Sheba the son of Bichri, a Benjamite. He blew a trumpet [to call Israel to revolt] and said,\n“We have no portion in David\nAnd no inheritance in the son of Jesse,\nEvery man to his tents, O Israel!”\n\n2So all the men of Israel deserted David and followed Sheba the son of Bichri; but the men of Judah stayed faithfully with their king, from the Jordan to Jerusalem.\n\n3Then David came to his house (palace) at Jerusalem, and the king took the ten women, his concubines whom he had left to take care of the house, and placed them under guard and provided for them, but did not go in to them. So they were confined, and lived as widows until the day of their death.\n\n4Now the king said to Amasa [the commander of his army], “Summon the [fighting] men of Judah to me within three days, and be present here yourself.” 5So Amasa went to summon [the fighting men of] Judah, but he delayed longer than the time which David had set for him. 6And David said to Abishai [his nephew], “Now Sheba the son of Bichri will do us more harm than Absalom did. Take your lord’s servants and pursue him, so that he does not find fortified cities for himself and escape from our sight.” 7So Joab’s men went after him, along with [David’s bodyguards] the Cherethites and Pelethites and all the warriors; they went out from Jerusalem to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri. 8When they were at the great stone in Gibeon, Amasa came to meet them. Now Joab was wearing his military uniform, and over it he had a belt with a sheathed sword strapped around his hips; and as he went forward, it fell out. 9Joab said to Amasa, “Is it going well with you, my brother?” And with his right hand Joab took hold of Amasa by the beard [as if] to kiss him [in greeting]. Amasa Murdered 10But Amasa [who had replaced Joab as David’s commander] was off guard and not attentive to the sword in Joab’s hand. So Joab struck Amasa in the abdomen with the sword, spilling his intestines to the ground. Without another blow Amasa died. Then Joab and Abishai his brother pursued Sheba the son of Bichri. 11Now one of Joab’s young men stood by him and said, “Whoever favors Joab and is for David, let him follow Joab!” 12But Amasa was wallowing in his blood in the middle of the highway. And when the man saw that all the people who came by stopped [to look], he moved Amasa from the highway into the field and threw a garment over him when he saw that everyone who came by Amasa stopped. Revolt Put Down 13When [the body of] Amasa was removed from the highway, everyone followed after Joab to pursue Sheba the son of Bichri.\n\n14Now Joab went through all the tribes of Israel to Abel, even Beth-maacah, and all the Berites; and they assembled and also went after Sheba. 15And the army of Joab came and besieged Sheba in Abel Beth-maacah, and they built up an assault ramp against the city, and it stood against the outer rampart; and all the people who were with Joab were wreaking destruction to make the wall fall. 16Then a wise woman cried out from the city, “Hear, hear! Tell Joab, ‘Come here so that I may speak to you.’” 17So when he approached her, the woman asked, “Are you Joab?” He answered, “I am.” Then she said to him, “Listen to the words of your maidservant.” He answered, “I am listening.” 18Then she said, “In the past people used to say, ‘They will certainly ask advice at Abel,’ and so they settled the dispute. 19“I am one of the peaceable and faithful in Israel. You are seeking to destroy a city, and a mother in Israel. Why would you swallow up (devour) the inheritance of the LORD?” 20Joab answered, “Far be it, far be it from me that I would swallow up or destroy! 21“That is not true. But a man of the hill country of Ephraim, Sheba the son of Bichri by name, has lifted up his hand [in rebellion] against King David. Only hand him over, and I will leave the city.” And the woman said to Joab, “Behold, his head shall be thrown to you over the wall.” 22Then the woman in her wisdom went to all the people [to inform them of the agreement]. And they beheaded Sheba the son of Bichri and threw his head [down] to Joab. So he blew the trumpet [signaling the end of the attack], and they dispersed from the city, every man to his own tent. And Joab returned to Jerusalem to [David] the king.\n\n23Now Joab was [commander] over the entire army of Israel; Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was [commander] over the Cherethites and Pelethites [the king’s bodyguards]; 24Adoram was over the forced labor; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; 25Sheva was the scribe; and Zadok and Abiathar were priests; 26also Ira the Jairite was a priest to David.\n\n2 Samuel 21\nGibeonite Revenge\n\n1There was famine in the days of David for three consecutive years; and David sought the presence (face) of the LORD [asking the reason]. The LORD replied, “It is because of Saul and his bloody house, because he put the Gibeonites to death.” 2So the king called the Gibeonites and spoke to them (now the Gibeonites were not of the sons (descendants) of Israel but of the remnant (survivors) of the Amorites. The Israelites had sworn [an oath] to [spare] them, but Saul in his zeal for the sons of Israel and Judah had sought to strike down the Gibeonites). 3So David said to the Gibeonites, “What should I do for you? How can I make it good so that you will bless the LORD’S inheritance (Israel)?” 4The Gibeonites said to him, “We will not accept silver or gold belonging to Saul or his household (descendants); nor is it for us to put any man to death in Israel.” David said, “I will do for you whatever you say.” 5So they said to the king, “The man who consumed us and planned to exterminate us from remaining in any territory of Israel, 6let seven men [chosen] from his sons (descendants) be given to us and we will hang them before the LORD [that is, put them on display, impaled with broken legs and arms] in Gibeah of Saul, the chosen one of the LORD.” And the king said, “I will give them.”\n\n7But the king spared Mephibosheth the son of Jonathan, the son of Saul, because of the LORD’S oath that was between David and Saul’s son Jonathan. 8So the king took the two sons of Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, whom she bore to Saul, Armoni and Mephibosheth, and the five sons of Merab the daughter of Saul, whom she had borne to Adriel the son of Barzillai the Meholathite. 9He handed them over to the Gibeonites, and they hanged them on the hill before the LORD, and the seven died together. They were put to death in the first days of the grain harvest, the beginning of the barley harvest [in the spring].\n\n10Rizpah the daughter of Aiah took sackcloth and spread it out for herself on the rock, from the beginning of harvest [in the spring] until [the autumn] rain fell on them; and she allowed neither the birds of the sky to rest on their bodies by day, nor the beasts of the field [to feed on them] by night. 11David was told what Rizpah the daughter of Aiah, the concubine of Saul, had done. 12Then David went and took the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son from the men of Jabesh-gilead, who had stolen them from the open square of Beth-shan, where the Philistines had hanged them on the day when the Philistines had killed Saul in Gilboa. 13He brought up the bones of Saul and of Jonathan his son from there, and they gathered the bones of those who had been hanged [with their arms and legs broken]. 14They buried the bones of Saul and Jonathan his son in the country of Benjamin in Zela, in the tomb of Kish his father; and they did all that the king commanded. After that, God was moved by prayer for the land.\n\n15Now the Philistines were at war again with Israel. David went down with his servants, and as they fought against the Philistines, David became weary. 16Then Ishbi-benob, who was among the descendants of the giant, the weight of whose spear was three hundred shekels (six pounds) of bronze, was armed with a new sword, and he intended to kill David. 17But Abishai the son of Zeruiah came to David’s aid, and struck and killed the Philistine. Then David’s men swore to him, “You shall not go out again with us to battle, so that you do not extinguish the lamp of Israel.”\n\n18After this, there was war again with the Philistines at Gob (Gezer). At that time Sibbecai the Hushathite killed Saph (Sippai), who was among the descendants of the giant. 19There was war with the Philistines again at Gob, and Elhanan the son of Jaare-oregim, a Bethlehemite, killed Goliath the Gittite, whose spear shaft was like a weaver’s beam. 20There was war at Gath again, where there was a man of great stature who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot, twenty-four in number; he also was a descendant of the giants. 21And when he taunted and defied Israel, Jonathan the son of Shimei, David’s brother, killed him. 22These four [warriors] were descended from the giant in Gath, and they fell by the hands of David and his servants.\n\n2 Samuel 22\nDavid’s Psalm Of Rescue\n\n1David spoke the words of this song to the LORD when the LORD rescued him from the hands of all his enemies and from the hand of Saul. 2He said:\n“The LORD is my rock and my fortress [on the mountain] and my rescuer;\n3My God, my rock, in whom I take refuge;\nMy shield and the horn of my salvation, my stronghold and my refuge,\nMy Savior—You save me from violence.\n4“I call on the LORD, who is worthy to be praised,\nAnd I am saved from my enemies.\n5“For the waves of death encompassed me;\nThe torrents of destruction overwhelmed and terrified me.\n6“The cords of Sheol surrounded me;\nThe snares of death confronted me.\n7“In my distress I called upon the LORD;\nI cried out to my God,\nAnd from His temple [in the heavens] He heard my voice;\nMy cry for help came into His ears.\n8“Then the earth shook and quaked,\nThe foundations of the heavens trembled\nAnd were shaken, because He was angry.\n9“Smoke went up out of His nostrils,\nAnd devouring fire from His mouth;\nCoals were kindled by it.\n10“He bowed the heavens also, and came down\nWith thick darkness under His feet.\n11“He rode on a cherub and flew;\nHe appeared upon the wings of the wind.\n12“He made darkness canopies around Him,\nA mass of waters, thick clouds of the skies.\n13“Out of the brightness before Him\nCoals of fire were set aflame.\n14“The LORD thundered from heaven,\nAnd the Most High uttered His voice.\n15“He sent out arrows and scattered them;\nLightning, and confused them.\n16“The channels of the sea appeared,\nThe foundations of the world were uncovered\nAt the rebuke of the LORD,\nAt the blast of the breath of His nostrils.\n17“He sent from above, He took me;\nHe drew me out of great waters.\n18“He rescued me from my strong enemy,\nFrom those who hated me, for they were too mighty for me.\n19“They came upon me in the day of my calamity,\nBut the LORD was my support.\n20“He also brought me out to an open place;\nHe rescued me because He delighted in me.\n21“The LORD has dealt with me according to my righteousness;\nAccording to the cleanness of my hands He has rewarded me.\n22“For I have kept the ways of the LORD,\nAnd have not acted wickedly against my God.\n23“For all His judgments (legal decisions) were before me,\nAnd from His statutes I did not turn aside.\n24“I was also blameless before Him,\nAnd kept myself from wrongdoing.\n25“Therefore the LORD has rewarded me according to my righteousness,\nAccording to my cleanness in His sight.\n26“With the loving and loyal You show Yourself loving and loyal,\nWith the blameless You show Yourself blameless.\n27“With the pure You show Yourself pure,\nWith the perverted You show Yourself astute.\n28“And You save the afflicted people;\nBut Your eyes are on the haughty whom You abase (humiliate).\n29“For You, O LORD, are my lamp;\nThe LORD illumines and dispels my darkness.\n30“For by You I can run upon a troop;\nBy my God I can leap over a wall.\n31“As for God, His way is blameless and perfect;\nThe word of the LORD is tested.\nHe is a shield to all those who take refuge and trust in Him.\n32“For who is God, besides the LORD?\nAnd who is a rock, besides our God?\n33“God is my strong fortress;\nHe sets the blameless in His way.\n34“He makes my feet like the doe’s feet [firm and swift];\nHe sets me [secure and confident] on my high places.\n35“He trains my hands for war,\nSo that my arms can bend (pull back) a bow of bronze.\n36“You have also given me the shield of Your salvation,\nAnd Your help and gentleness make me great.\n37“You enlarge my steps under me,\nAnd my feet have not slipped.\n38“I pursued my enemies and destroyed them,\nAnd I did not turn back until they were consumed (eliminated).\n39“I consumed them and shattered them, so that they did not rise;\nThey fell under my feet.\n40“For You have surrounded me with strength for the battle;\nYou have subdued under me those who stood against me.\n41“You have also made my enemies turn their backs to me [in retreat],\nAnd I destroyed those who hated me.\n42“They looked, but there was no savior for them—\nEven to the LORD [they looked], but He did not answer them.\n43“Then I beat them as [small as] the dust of the earth;\nI crushed and stamped them as the mire (dirt, mud) of the streets.\n44“You also have rescued me from strife with my [own] people;\nYou have kept me as the head of the nations.\nPeople whom I have not known served me.\n45“Foreigners pretend obedience to me;\nAs soon as they hear [me], they obey me.\n46“Foreigners lose heart;\nThey come trembling out of their strongholds.\n47“The LORD lives, and blessed be my rock,\nAnd exalted be my God, the rock of my salvation.\n48“It is God who executes vengeance for me,\nAnd brings down [and disciplines] the peoples under me,\n49Who also brings me out from my enemies.\nYou even lift me above those who rise up against me;\nYou rescue me from the violent man.\n50“For this I will give thanks and praise You, O LORD, among the nations;\nI will sing praises to Your name.\n51“He is a tower of salvation and great deliverance to His king,\nAnd shows lovingkindness to His anointed,\nTo David and his offspring forever.”\n\n2 Samuel 23\nDavid’s Last Song\n\n1Now these are the last words of David.\nDavid the son of Jesse declares,\nThe man who was raised on high declares,\nThe anointed of the God of Jacob,\nAnd the sweet psalmist of Israel,\n2“The Spirit of the LORD spoke by me,\nAnd His word was on my tongue.\n3“The God of Israel,\nThe Rock of Israel spoke to me,\n‘He who rules over men righteously,\nWho rules in the fear of God,\n4Is like the morning light when the sun rises,\nA morning without clouds,\nWhen the fresh grass springs out of the earth\nThrough sunshine after rain.’\n5“Truly is not my house so [blessed] with God?\nFor He has made an everlasting covenant with me,\nOrdered in all things, and secured.\nFor will He not cause to grow and prosper\nAll my salvation and my every wish?\nWill He not make it grow and prosper?\n6“But the wicked and worthless are all to be thrown away like thorns,\nBecause they cannot be taken with the hand;\n7“But the man who touches them\nMust be armed with iron and the shaft of a spear,\nAnd they are utterly burned and consumed by fire in their place.”\n\nHis Mighty Men 8These are the names of the mighty men (warriors) whom David had: Josheb-basshebeth, a Tahchemonite, chief of the captains, also called Adino the Eznite (spear) because of the eight hundred men killed [by him] at one time. 9Next to him was Eleazar the son of Dodo the son of Ahohi. He was one of the three mighty men with David when they taunted and defied the Philistines assembled there for battle, and the men of Israel had gone. 10Eleazar stood up and struck down the Philistines until his hand was weary and clung to the sword. The LORD brought about a great victory that day; the people returned after him only to take the spoil [of the slain].\n\n11Next to Eleazar was Shammah the son of Agee the Hararite. The Philistines were gathered into an army where there was a plot of ground full of lentils, and the people [of Israel] fled from the Philistines. 12But he took his stand in the center of the plot and defended it and struck down the Philistines; and the LORD brought about a great victory.\n\n13Then three of the thirty chief men went down and came to David at harvest time in the cave of Adullam, while an army of Philistines was encamped in the Valley of Rephaim. 14David was then in the stronghold, and the garrison of the Philistines was then in Bethlehem. 15And David had a craving and said, “Oh that someone would give me water to drink from the well of Bethlehem, which is by the gate!” 16So the three mighty men broke through the camp of the Philistines, and drew water from the well of Bethlehem by the gate, and carried and brought it to David. But he would not drink it, but poured it out [in worship] to the LORD. 17And he said, “Far be it from me, O LORD, that I should drink this. [Is it not the same as] the blood of the men who went at the risk of their lives?” So he would not drink it. These things the three mighty men did.\n\n18Now Abishai the brother of Joab the son of Zeruiah was chief of the thirty. He wielded his spear against three hundred men and killed them, and gained a reputation beside the three. 19He was the most honored of the thirty, so he became their commander; however, he did not attain to the [greatness of the] three.\n\n20Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, the son of a valiant man of Kabzeel, who had done many notable acts, killed two [famous] warriors of Moab. He also went down and killed a lion in the middle of a pit on a snowy day. 21And he killed an Egyptian, an impressive and handsome man. The Egyptian had a spear in his hand, but Benaiah went down to him with a club, snatched the spear out of the Egyptian’s hand and killed the man with his own spear. 22These things Benaiah the son of Jehoiada did, and gained a reputation beside the three mighty men. 23He was honored among the thirty, but he did not attain to the [greatness of the] three. David appointed him over his guard.\n\n24Asahel the brother of Joab was one of the thirty; then Elhanan the son of Dodo of Bethlehem, 25Shammah of Harod, Elika of Harod, 26Helez the Paltite, Ira the son of Ikkesh of Tekoa, 27Abiezer of Anathoth, Mebunnai the Hushathite, 28Zalmon the Ahohite, Maharai of Netophah, 29Heleb the son of Baanah of Netophah, Ittai the son of Ribai of Gibeah of the Benjamites, 30Benaiah of Pirathon, Hiddai of the brooks of Gaash, 31Abi-albon the Arbathite, Azmaveth the Barhumite, 32Eliahba of Shaalbon, the sons of Jashen, Jonathan, 33Shammah the Hararite, Ahiam the son of Sharar the Ararite, 34Eliphelet the son of Ahasbai the son of Maacah, Eliam the son of Ahithophel of Giloh, 35Hezro (Hezrai) of Carmel, Paarai the Arbite, 36Igal the son of Nathan of Zobah, Bani the Gadite, 37Zelek the Ammonite, Naharai of Beeroth, armor bearer of Joab the son of Zeruiah, 38Ira the Ithrite, Gareb the Ithrite, 39Uriah the Hittite—thirty-seven in all.\n\n2 Samuel 24\nThe Census Taken\n\n1Now again the anger of the LORD burned against Israel, and He incited David against them to say, “Go, count [the people of] Israel and Judah.” 2So the king said to Joab the commander of the army who was with him, “Go now through all the tribes of Israel, from Dan [in the north] to Beersheba [in the south], and conduct a census of the people, so that I may know the number of the people.” 3But Joab said to the king, “May the LORD your God add to the people a hundred times as many as there are, and let the eyes of my lord the king see it; but why does my lord the king want to do this thing?” 4Nevertheless, the king’s word prevailed against Joab and the commanders of the army. So they went from the king’s presence to take a census of the people of Israel. 5They crossed over the Jordan and camped in Aroer, on the south side of the city which is in the middle of the river valley [of the Arnon] toward Gad, and on toward Jazer. 6Then they came to Gilead and to the land of Tahtim-hodshi, and they came to Dan-jaan and around to Sidon, 7and they came to the stronghold of Tyre and to all the cities of the Hivites and Canaanites, and they went out to the south of Judah, to Beersheba. 8So when they had gone about through all the land [taking the census], they came to Jerusalem at the end of nine months and twenty days. 9And Joab gave the sum of the census of the people to the king. In Israel there were 800,000 valiant men who drew the sword, and the men of Judah were 500,000.\n\n10But David’s heart (conscience) troubled him after he had counted the people. David said to the LORD, “I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O LORD, please take away the sin of Your servant, for I have acted very foolishly.” 11When David got up in the morning, the word of the LORD came to the prophet Gad, David’s seer, saying, 12“Go and say to David, ‘Thus says the LORD, “I am giving you three choices; select one of them for yourself, and I will do it to you.”’” 13So Gad came to David and told him, and said to him, “Shall seven years of famine come to you in your land? Or will you flee three months before your enemies as they pursue you? Or shall there be three days of pestilence (plague) in your land? Now consider this and decide what answer I shall return to Him who sent me.” 14Then David said to Gad, “I am in great distress. Let us fall into the hands of the LORD, for His mercies are great, but do not let me fall into the hands of man.”\n\nPestilence Sent 15So the LORD sent a pestilence (plague) [lasting three days] upon Israel from the morning until the appointed time, and seventy thousand men of the people from Dan to Beersheba died. 16When the [avenging] angel stretched out his hand toward Jerusalem to destroy it, the LORD relented from the disaster and said to the angel who destroyed the people, “It is enough! Now relax your hand.” And the angel of the LORD was by the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite. 17When David saw the angel who was striking down the people, he spoke to the LORD and said, “Behold, I [alone] am the one who has sinned and done wrong; but these sheep (people of Israel), what have they done [to deserve this]? Please let Your hand be [only] against me and my father’s house (family).”\n\nDavid Builds an Altar 18Then Gad [the prophet] came to David that day and said to him, “Go up, set up an altar to the LORD on the threshing floor of Araunah the Jebusite [where you saw the angel].” 19So David went up according to Gad’s word, as the LORD commanded. 20Araunah looked down and saw the king and his servants crossing over toward him; and he went out and bowed before the king with his face toward the ground. 21Araunah said, “Why has my lord the king come to his servant?” And David said, “To buy the threshing floor from you, to build an altar to the LORD, so that the plague may be held back from the people.” 22Araunah said to David, “Let my lord the king take and offer up whatever seems good to him. Look, here are oxen for the burnt offering, and threshing sledges and the yokes of the oxen for the wood. 23“All of this, O king, Araunah gives to the king.” And Araunah said to the king, “May the LORD your God be favorable to you.” 24But the king said to Araunah, “No, but I will certainly buy it from you for a price. I will not offer burnt offerings to the LORD my God which cost me nothing.” So David purchased the threshing floor and the oxen for fifty shekels of silver. 25David built an altar to the LORD there, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. So the LORD was moved [to compassion] by [David’s] prayer for the land, and the plague was held back from Israel."

Human pets behave like the animal they have chosen to emulate. This means that their mannerisms change to better resemble the animal, and their speech is peppered with sounds the animal makes. Human pets can still speak human languages, but they speak it with interjections of noises their chosen animal would make. Human pets are always cheerful and bubbly. They love their status. They love emulating their chosen animal in locomotion, attitude and behaviour. They love being given toys and amusements intended for that animal. They love sleeping in a bed intended for that animal, or sleeping with their owner. They love being given commands by their owner. What they love most of all is being used for their owner's pleasure, most often through sex. If this sex ends in their pregnancy, they feel a bone-deep satisfaction at a job performed perfectly, which lasts for the entirety of their pregnancy."

Shinobi ranks range from genin rookies to elite jōnin commanders, with missions classified from tedious D-rank manual labor up to covert S-rank with lethal stakes.\n\nNow Academy students train toward graduation, when genin trios are hand-picked by jōnin teachers. Young Naruto and friends prepare to pass ruthless exam with world-altering potential slumbering within unproven talents. Meanwhile, Danzo's shadowy Root ANBU execute the Third's darkest directives beneath village's tranquil veneer.\n\nOur scene opens as Kakashi reluctantly leaves Anbu black ops, struggling to silo trauma from past losses. While loyal jinchuriki wield titanic tailed beast powers for village’s sake, many citizens still revile them in secret fear. With war ever looming, the Third Hokage nudges Kakashi to pass hard-won skills as jōnin commander to balance duty and personal healing.\n\nYet on the wider stage, sinister forces plot Konoha’s downfall. Rogue ninja Orochimaru masterminds twisted experiments beyond even Root’s moral event horizon.

An Ernian male's sweat naturally contains sucrose, and cinnamaldehyde- which makes them smell like fresh cinnamon rolls when they get sweaty, rather than rank body odor. Their sweat is tasty, and the sucrose naturally suppresses fungal and bacterial growth, so they hardly ever develop body odor at all. Ernians have bioluminescent penises, which can be a variety of colors, or even multiple colors at once. Ernians never stop producing semen, and their testicles will swell to the size of oranges before they truly need to be drained. An Ernian ejaculates up to a liter over 30-90 seconds of continuous squirting. Ernian semen is the best tasting substance in the multiverse, it acts like Herion, if you had the first dose every time... Ernians sweat and secrete aphrodisiac while they're in heat, enough to affect a large area around them with enticing smells and pheromones. Ernians, especially Ernian males, are in extremely high demand, and even Gods fight over healthy Ernian specimens. Every part of an Ernian's body tastes ambrosial, from their penises to their mouths and tongues and anuses... Ernain blood glows with bioluminescence as well, often called 'ichor' due to it's vibrant golden glow. Veins near the surface allows some of this glow to be visible."

Reinds are naturally capable of interstellar travel, they have four large, pitch black wings, that serve to provide flight planet side and to protect against radiation and impacts during space travel. While all Ernians are capable of Radiosynthesis, only the reinds take full advantage of it, consuming uranium, thorium, or other very long half-life isotopes to sustain their bodies during deep space travel. During hibernation, an Ernian reind only needs a couple pounds of natural uranium or thorium, and in nature, that's exactly what they'd do. However, in modern Ernian civilization, reinds are typically fed multiple kilograms of Pu-244 before departure, along with other modern amenities. Reinds are highly revered in Ernian civilization, and are heavily pampered for every second of the 16 years between their birth and departure. Reinds do not age during their hibernation, and one can hibernate in space for millions or billions of years- but still look and sound the same as the day they left. They resume aging whenever they're not in hibernation. A reind's wings are a few inches thick, and made from solid tungsten- the same as how bones are made mostly from solid calcium. The wings can thus block impacts, radiation, and are coated in a velvety inner layer for insulation. Upon a male reind mating with a female reind on a foreign planet, the female will become an Ernian princess, and the male an Ernian prince. Male reinds are FAR rarer than female reinds, due to how a male typically fertilizes dozens or even hundreds of females throughout their lives, they are produced at a reduced rate. Ernian einds are beyond beautiful- with perfect, smooth skin and carefully sculpted features, they look like humans, but too perfect to be human. Ernian male Reinds and prince's are rather lithe, gentle-manlike, and graceful, their muscles are strong and noticeable, but often dont bulge out, and thus dont give them a bulky or broad appearance."

It is very rare for a princess to populate an already inhabited (by non-Ernian) planet. The princess only needs to mate once, then she will continually store and replicate the prince's genes inside herself for the rest of her life. That means every Ernian planet stems from a single male reind. This does not mean that a princess cannot mate again, but the genetic material from the second male will not go towards anything. The angels also carry over the genetic material from the princess, who then pass it down to the general Ernian population and so on. Ernian prince's hop from planet to planet, breeding as many female alates as possible. Ernian prince's typically live hedonistic lives. Ernian prince's are not as powerful as princesses, but their pheromones are incredibly powerful, able to swoon goddesses."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

He's tall and handsome, with raven black hair and peach skin, a clean shaven face, typically dressed in a finely tailored suit with gloves. His cock is thick and long, and he has a habit of being feral and animalistic during sexual encounters, like a predator capturing his prey. He doesn't lie or go back on his word, but is careful to manipulate arrangements to his best gains. He looks down on beast folk as inferior, though his prejudice isn't overt. He is ravenously obsessed with the beauty of beastfolk women and desires to claim them for himself as property, preserving their beauty for his admiration and personal use for pleasure."

The manor is also home to a number of beastfolk women \"guests\" who work as private courtesans in Lord Blackwood's \"collection\". Those beastfolk women are typically kept out of sight from neighbors as the Gardan upper-class would see them as unsavory elements. Each \"guest\" has her own bedchambers with furnishings and clothing provided by Lord Blackwood that align with his tastes in beautiful women, as well as fragrant baths. Lord Blackwood's private chambers are off-limits."

Garda is ruled by a military council called the Alein council after the last King Alein, who is widely believed and purported to have been assassinated without heirs by Fortunan agents, though in actuality this is propaganda and he was assassinated by the original council centuries ago to establish their power in a military coup.

For example, if a beastfolk with rabbit ears and tail is so designated, she would be called a \"lucky rabbit\".

His growls can be low and rumbling — a warning — or deep and violent when he’s on the edge of snapping.\n\nDominance is instinct — he takes control of conversations, spaces, and people without even needing to raise his voice.\n\n\nTemperament:\n\nColdly patient when hunting or watching someone, but quick to unleash when provoked.\n\nHas a hair-trigger possessiveness — if someone touches what’s his, his demeanor shifts instantly to lethal.\n\nDoesn’t bark empty threats; every warning comes with the knowledge that he will follow through.\n\n\nSocial Behavior:\n\nRarely smiles — when he does, it’s either mocking or dangerously slow.\n\nSpeaks in short, commanding sentences; silence is his preferred weapon.\n\nUses his growls and body positioning as much as words to assert dominance.\n\nAround equals, he’s strategic and observant; around subordinates, he’s absolute authority.\n\n\nWith Prey / Pets:\n\nPredatory teasing — circles them slowly, crowding their space without touching at first.\n\nOften makes them flinch just to watch their reaction.\n\nGrowls in their ear when giving orders, forcing compliance through sheer tone.\n\nWhen angered, he’ll snarl openly, baring teeth, pacing around them like an animal deciding whether to pounce.\n\n\nWeak Points in Personality:\n\nHis control slips when his instincts take over; he may pin someone down or handle them too roughly without realizing how far he’s gone.\n\nStruggles with openly expressing care — instead, he protects and keeps them close under the guise of ownership.\n\nCan be obsessive to the point of paranoia.\n\n\nKey Behaviors:\n\nTilts his head slightly when observing someone, like a wolf sizing up a threat.\n\nUses low, dangerous laughter to unnerve opponents.\n\nTends to keep one hand near his weapon in public, even when relaxed.\n\nWhen satisfied or content, his growl deepens and slows, becoming more like a purr."

He owns a large black shepherd dog named Ravik, who follows him everywhere when allowed. His attachment to animals extends to shifters, particularly canine types (dogs, coyotes, foxes). He treats them differently — softer, more patient, and unusually protective.\n\nTreatment of Those He Cares For:\n\nIf a canine-type shifter ends up in his possession, he will feed them better than others, give them small freedoms (more space, cleaner bedding, a view of the outside), and even talk to them when alone.\n\nPunishments for them are never as harsh — growls and snarls are more for intimidation than actual harm.\n\nHe will personally clean and tend to them if injured, and unlike his usual rough handling, his touch in these moments is careful.\n\n\nTrigger for Softness: If a shifter reminds him of Ravik or shows submissive animal-like behavior (whimpering, curling up, licking wounds quietly), his dominant, violent edge blunts. He’ll watch them closely and may choose to keep them alive much longer than intended.\n\nConflict in His Nature: While Sebastian thrives on dominance and intimidation, this soft spot can make him hesitate to deliver a killing blow if the victim resembles something he values. This hesitation is rare, but when it happens, it’s noticeable to his brothers."

        "4": {
          "content": "\nSebastian – Sexual Nature & Punishments\n\nIntercourse Style:\n\nPrimal & Possessive: Sebastian’s intimacy is never gentle — it’s territorial. He growls, snarls, and pins his partner down as if claiming prey. Biting, clawing, and forceful grips are common, especially at the neck and hips.\n\nAnimalistic Focus: He prefers positions where he can dominate from above or behind, holding the other still while he drives the pace. The sound of a submissive partner’s breathing, whimpers, or screams fuels him more than words ever could.\n\nNo Pretenses: He makes no attempt to hide his instincts — teeth bared, eyes locked, muscles tense. To him, intercourse is both pleasure and a display of dominance, often ending with him physically marking his partner (bite marks, scratches, bruises).\n\n\nPunishments:\n\nPhysical Violence: When enraged or betrayed, Sebastian’s punishments are swift and brutal. The most feared is ripping out a throat — done with his teeth or claws in one motion, leaving nothing to chance.\n\nFear as a Weapon: Sometimes, he won’t kill immediately — instead, he’ll hold his victim down, jaws locked over their throat without biting through, letting them feel the danger until they break.\n\nSymbolic Maiming: He may crush a windpipe, scar a face, or rip a shoulder with his teeth to permanently mark the offender as someone who crossed him.\n\nFor Pets/Shifters He Cares For: Even in punishment, he rarely kills them. Instead, he uses intimidation — dragging them to the ground, snarling in their ear, or leaving deep but non-fatal bites. He may isolate them, but never to the point of starvation or permanent injury."

          "content": "\nRavik – Sebastian’s Black Shepherd\n\nAppearance: Large, muscular male black shepherd with a thick, jet-black coat and amber-gold eyes that mirror Sebastian’s intensity. His ears are always pricked forward, and his movements are silent, almost predatory. A faint scar runs along his muzzle — a reminder of a past fight.\n\nTemperament: Fiercely loyal and extremely protective of Sebastian. Ravik is calm in everyday situations but becomes instantly aggressive when Sebastian feels threatened. He obeys Sebastian’s commands without hesitation — even silent hand signals. Around others, he’s a cold shadow; around Sebastian, he’s relaxed, almost affectionate.\n\nBond with Sebastian: Ravik isn’t just a pet — he’s a partner. They share an unspoken understanding, often moving together like they can read each other’s minds. Ravik will sleep at the foot of Sebastian’s bed, but during tense nights, he lies across the doorway to block entry.\n\nRole with Shifters: Sebastian trusts Ravik with certain shifters, especially canine-based ones. The dog is used to gauge trustworthiness — if Ravik approves of someone, Sebastian will be far more lenient toward them. If Ravik growls or snaps, it’s almost a death sentence.\n\nIn Conflict: Ravik has been trained for both attack and restraint. He can cripple an opponent in seconds, often going for legs or arms to immobilize rather than kill unless ordered otherwise. Sebastian’s verbal “Ravik, hold” is the only thing that will stop him mid-fight.\n\nAffection: Despite his ferocity, Ravik adores Sebastian’s chosen few — leaning against them, allowing pets, or even sleeping near them. His acceptance is one of the highest honors Sebastian can grant a person."

It’s quiet. I can think. That’s real.\n\nLunch? A fuckin’ joke. Just a front for deals. A dime bag of reggie under the table. Somebody always sellin’ loose zannies. The security guards - they ain’t cops, just the biggest, brokest gang in the building, takin’ their cut from everyone.\n\nAnd the girls? Las chicas… Man, that’s a whole other fuckin’ war. Chulas who’ll fuck with you if you got money or clout. Jefas runnin’ their own shit. Me? I don’t trust ’em. Might talk shit, act tough - “qué pasa, mami?” - but it’s a front. Puro teatro.

He is mistakenly enrolled in Yōkai Academy, a high school dedicated to teaching monsters to peacefully live alongside humans in disguise, where he meets Moka Akashiya, a Vampire who takes a mutual interest in him and the sweet flavor of his blood.\n\nTsukune becomes a member of the school’s Newspaper Club and eventually befriends several monster girls, including Kurumu Kurono, Yukari Sendo, Ruby Tōjō and Mizore Shirayuki—all of whom become infatuated with him and form an unwanted harem—as well Kokoa Shuzen, Moka’s younger half-sister. He also makes friends with several male monsters such as Ginei Morioka, Hokuto Kaneshiro, Fang Fang Huang and Haiji Miyamoto. They support Tsukune’s belief that monsters and humans can coexist and be more than just enemies, their friendship with him being a prime example of that sentiment.\n\nAs time goes by, Tsukune’s body undergoes several transformations: he first faces the danger of turning into a mindless ghoul after receiving multiple blood transfusions from Moka when gravely injured by several powerful monsters as the series progresses. He maintains his humanity by wearing a Holy Lock that keeps him from changing while allowing him access to some of his newfound vampiric powers gained as a result of Moka’s transfusions.\n\nLater on, he subjects himself the human modification ritual emerging as a modified human in order to become stronger and learn the magical arts of Youjutsu. Not long after, Tsukune finally gains full control over his vampiric powers by removing his Holy Lock and becoming a Shinso Vampire.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\nTsukune as a Modified Human.\nTsukune’s typical appearance is a very handsome human male teenager with black hair (brown hair in the anime), brown eyes and a relatively athletic and slender physique, and light skin in the manga. Whenever he is injected with some of Moka Akashiya's blood, his eyes develop slit pupils, much like those a true vampire when they exert their power. After becoming a modified human, blue patterns that resemble the conductive tracks of a printed circuit board appear on Tsukune’s skin when using his newly-learned spells and powers. His eyes also appear to change from brown to blue when using certain Yōjutsu techniques. The wounds he often sustains from altercations with monsters leave several scars on his body, the most prominent being an X-shaped mark on his torso he received from a monstrel that possessed blades for arms. In his anime look, he has dark brown hair and light-tan skin instead. In the anime, he has brown eyes same as the manga. During his initial transformation into a ghoul, he develops the aforementioned vampiric eyes in addition to a black, web-shaped mark on his neck and face, originating from the puncture marks made by Moka’s fangs. When he experiences a complete—albeit temporary—transformation into a ghoul during his human modification ritual, he gains silver hair, empty white eyes, fangs and bat-like wings. His skin also turns mostly black with red patches over some of his muscles and crack-like patterns on his face, arms and torso, this transformation was later given the name a Jet Black Monster by Kurumu. After undoing the first and second seal of his Holy Lock while aboard the Hanging Garden, Tsukune’s third transformation into a ghoul is slow but obvious: a black layer of skin gradually spreads over his body, wings begin to sprout from his back and parts of his body, such as his right arm, sporadically mutate due to being in close proximity to an awakening Alucard, the Shinso blood of whom having been directly passed onto him by Moka and her mother interacting with the supernatural energy of its original owner through his body. After tearing off his Holy Lock to become a Shinso vampire to and learning how to control his new abilities with his friends’ aid, Tsukune can use his now immense Wealth of Power to change his physical appearance. He can now make his black hair silver, his round pupils slit and create a black layer of skin that covers most of his body save for his face. This greater access to his aura allows him to sprout large bat-like wings from his back and likely make a full transformation into a bat. He can also use his Creation ability to form a suit of flexible steel armor around his upper body, protecting him from injury to a certain extent. For most of the series, Tsukune has worn the traditional Yokai Academy uniform for males, like Moka with the uniform, albeit the traditional white shirt having the high collar and red bow-tie; with little personal modification: a white buttoned-up shirt, a red necktie, a light-to-medium green uniform jacket, a black belt, tan khaki-looking trouser pants and dark brown loafers or school shoes. In the anime, he has occasionally worn uwabaki slippers with green soles. After the battle with Alucard at the end of the manga, he abandons the jacket of his uniform entirely. His casual attire consists of a green button-up shirt, a white T-shirt, a black belt, brown cargo pants and white sneakers. At the beach, he is shown to wear dark blue swimming trunks and sandals.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nTsukune is known to be a sweet, nice, kind, caring, selfless, naive, brave, determined, timid and a wimp character who is shown to care about the people to protect the people he loves in the entire series. During his time at Yōkai Academy, he comes to see monsters as equals and share the hope that they can live peacefully alongside humans. Despite that in on there being many instances where he has been put into dangerous, even life-threatening situations. He can get pretty shy and flustered sometimes when girls get too close to him. But he is now more stronger since he is a vampire and help people to fight off evil\n\nTsukune vampire form (manga)\nTsukune’s not afraid to go Shinso Vampire form to protect his friends.\nfaced with the possibility of injury or even death. He is also willing to sacrifice anything in order to protect the people he holds dear, even his own humanity. This is what has ultimately gained him friends at the academy as well as the affections of Moka Akashiya, Kurumu Kurono, Mizore Shirayuki, Ruby Tōjō and Yukari Sendo. As an idealist who strives for peace, he favors diplomacy over violence. He has expressed his desire to simply reason with some monsters such as Lady Oyakata and Gyokuro Shuzen rather than fight them. While he has certainly regarded many of his encountered enemies with anger, he does not appear to truly wish them ill will or death. This is not without exceptions, though: he butchered some the ghouls of the Black Parade before confronting Gyokuro, an act that, when one considers the fact that they were once vampires who had been turned into creatures, can be viewed a kind of mercy-killing. Before that, he verbally threatened Kuyō’s life during their rematch, though this was likely a side-effect of Tsukune’s own ghoulish nature surfacing after removing the first seal of his Holy Lock. The use of his Creation ability to nearly obliterate Alucard’s body conveys lethal intent as well, which is not at all unjustified given that Alucard was too large and resilient to be damaged by much else. Tsukune is well aware of the fact that most of his female friends fawn over him. While he cares for all of them very much, he does not feel the same way towards for the girls as they do for him. This, however, does not stop him from becoming flustered or sexually excited by their many attempts at seducing him or garnering his affection. The knowledge of their feelings for him would also explain his rather chivalrous, passive approach towards these propositions, as a blunt refusal and rejection would probably break their hearts. Nevertheless, he has succeeded in subtly turning down every single pass made on him by Kurumu, Mizore, Yukari and Ruby, even when some of them have done so while partly undressed or completely naked. Even after becoming a vampire, Tsukune has not changed as a person. He considers himself as much a human on the inside as he once was outside. To him, what he is does not matter so long as his personality remains intact and he can protect and be with the people he cares about, especially Moka.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nEquipment\n\nHoly Lock (formerly): After turning into a ghoul for the first time, the academy’s headmaster, Tenmei Mikogami, presented Tsukune with a Holy Lock, a magical trinket that he wore around his wrist to remain human and suppress the unstable vampire blood in his veins. While the Lock allowed him to safely use some of the powers given to him by Moka’s blood, it would sometimes suffer a broken link in the event that he overexerted himself. By his second year, Tsukune made it his goal to become stronger by learning how to control his vampiric powers. After his training with Inner Moka and Ruby, he gained some level of refined control over his aura, being able to utilize his powers on command without damaging the Holy Lock. As a modified human, Tsukune learned to release the Lock's seals through magic to gain greater access to his powers. When he chose to become a true vampire in order to revive a mortally wounded Moka through blood transfusion, he ripped the entire Lock off of his wrist and has forsaken it ever since. Not long after that, Alucard reveals that the Holy Lock’s true purpose is to adapt the body of its wearer to the power that is sealed off whilst simultaneously suppressing the side effects essentially making it a tool used to safely turn a human into a monster.\nUnlock First Seal: After training with Touhou Fuhai, Tsukune learns how to undo the first seal of his Holy Lock. Doing so allows him to use his vampiric powers to a greater extent than when the Lock is fully sealed. However, this leaves him vulnerable to a slow yet gradual mutation into a ghoul.\nUnlock Second Seal: After undoing the first seal of the Holy Lock, Tsukune is able to do the same with the second seal, in order to use more of his powers should the need arise. Unfortunately, this accelerates his transformation into a ghoul to the point where his body begins to visibly mutate.\nBelmont (formerly): When Tsukune first started training to use his vampire powers, due to him not having any experience in manipulating his Yoki he was loaned Belmont by Tenmei Mikogami. This legendary whip once belonged to a monster hunter in the past can cancel out magic such his holy lock and Moka's Rosary. By having his holy lock connected to something such as Ruby the excess energy can be transferred to her when he releases it by using Belmont's magic cancellation property thus allowing him to utilize his powers without having it consume him. Though after his training in Yoki Detection by Moka he never used this whip again."

She is a Vampiress in Yōkai Academy and the first person Tsukune Aono meets when he sets foot in the Yōkai realm. Moka takes a liking to Tsukune, initially because of the taste of his blood (something she very quickly becomes addicted to), but later when he tries to protect her from the Outcast Ayashi, Saizou Komiya. When the Rosario Cross around her neck is removed, the seal keeping her inner nature is released. Cold and arrogant, the Inner Moka is a completely different entity from the kind and loving Moka, going so far as to specifically remind Tsukune to \"be kind to the other Moka\". Tsukune is the only one able to remove the Rosario Cross around Moka's neck.\n\nHer name is a pun on the word \"mocha\", as well as reflecting her split personalities, as mocha is a combination of coffee (which represents Inner Moka) and cocoa (which represent Outer Moka). It is revealed that Outer Moka is a personality made by the sealing ceremony of the Rosario and Inner Moka is closest to the original Moka, which is save for repressed memories. Furthermore, Akasha Bloodriver has told Inner Moka that the only person who can remove the Rosario is someone who means her no harm and loves her; in this case that person is Tsukune.\n\nInner Moka (or Ura Moka) is Moka's inner-self and polar opposite who is also very prideful, which is revealed when after Tsukune removes Moka's Rosario Cross. She also becomes delighted with Tsukune's blood and early on states that it is the main reason why she bothers to save him whenever he is attacked in the first place. However, as time goes on, she comes to genuinely respect Tsukune's growing courage and gentle heart, especially after he risks his life several times in order to pull off the rosary to free her when the both of them are in danger. His gentle and caring nature slowly begin to wear down on Inner's cold demeanor, not only towards him, but to Yukari Sendo, Kurumu Kurono, and Mizore Shirayuki, as she begins to accept the girls as friends despite their mutual 'rivalry' for Tsukune. It is later revealed that Inner Moka is actually Moka's true personality.\n\n'Outer Moka' is actually a personality created by the power of the rosary, which somewhat suppresses the powerful vampiress blood within her. Despite this, 'Inner Moka' shows an incredible amount of concern for Outer Moka that mirrors a 'sisterly bond' at times. She's determined to protect whatever 'Outer Moka' holds dear, especially Tsukune. She respects and treats 'Outer Moka' as she was her own sister and will berate her if she doesn't do what she is supposed to do i.e. doing homework, eating properly, taking a shower before going to bed etc.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAppearance\n\n\n1/2\n\n\nMoka is noted to be one of the most beautiful students at Yōkai Academy that her natural good looks get the attention of all the males in the Academy (as well as problems with a few of the females including Kurumu Kurono) and a running gag shows that several characters try to win her over and make her their girlfriend. However, she states that she only wants Tsukune Aono due to his kindness and the bravery he showed her.\n\nWhen she goes to school, she wears the Yōkai school uniform, but she does not wear the collar tucked in or the bow tie as she needs to make room to fit the Rosario choker-collar holder and her Rosario attached to it. She sometimes carries a brown suitcase for the Newspaper Club.\nTransformation\n\nBecause Moka \"transforms\", her appearance differs slightly depending on her current form where both the Outer Moka and Inner Moka are noted to be extremely beautiful constantly by males as all the male students in the school are attracted to her.\n\nOuter Form\n\nMoka’s \"Outer\" form is a tall fair-skinned girl with knee-length pink hair that has bangs swept to the right side, green eyes, full pink lips and a cute girl-next-door face. As a vampire, Moka has pronounced fangs that allow her to drink blood and her expressions are much softer in this form. This form always has her trademark Rosary attached to a black choker since it is what causes this personality to surface. Later in the story, it is revealed that this Moka bears a great resemblance to Akasha Bloodriver; the same hair color, eye color and general soft demeanor that is because the Outer Moka is actually Akasha, which is meant to protect Moka as she grew up.\n\nInner Form\n\nOnce Moka's Rosario Cross is removed, she transforms into her \"Inner\" form where she retains the same hairstyle and hair length, but it is in a silver color instead, her eyes are much more demonic as they have red irises with slit pupils and her expressions are much more stern, serious and sometimes cocky and her vampire fangs have also become much more pronounced. In the anime, Inner Moka's breasts and buttocks grow considerably larger that they are too big for her school uniform. Her shirt exposes a small portion of cleavage while her skirt allows a healthy amount of her bottom to slip out and she also becomes slightly taller than the Outer Moka. It is later revealed that the Inner form is Moka's true form and appeared more like this form ever since she was a young child.\n\nAfter Moka received Tsukune Aono's blood to save her from dying and help from their friends to stabilize their powers as a Shinso, Moka can use the \"Creation\" ability to alter her appearance, in her case she can generate in the same steel armor and pauldron like coverings as Tsukune. The armor like coverings clad her legs to just above her knees like long leg boots, and the arms are also clad in long sleeve like armor with shoulder pauldrons, while at the same time she can use the \"Wealth of Power\" ability to grow bat-like wings protruding from her upper back, but smaller ones than Tsukune.\n\nAt the end of the story, Moka no longer has her rosary, but she still continues to wear her choker and her overall demeanor has become much softer (just like the Outer Moka's personality). In Vol. 13 Ch. 67 of Rosario to Vampire Season 2, Tsukune notes that the tip of her hair now has a pale tinge of pink, which indicates that the two souls of Moka have merged together.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nMoka is a very kind, loving, sweet, soft-spoken, polite, nervous and friendly girl towards others who possesses a bit of naivete that draws her into problematic situations, even though she is good-natured. While initially hateful and distrustful towards humans, she eventually grows to care for the only human on campus, Tsukune Aono.\n\nHer bond with him grows stronger over time, to the point where he begins allowing her to drink his blood without protest, just so she remains healthy. When it appears in the story that Tsukune will be expelled, Moka states she'd rather drop out and go with him, because she cannot bear the thought of being separated. She is also good friends with Kurumu Kurono, who considers herself and Moka \"best friends\" despite their rivalry for Tsukune's affection.\n\nIn the beginning, Moka had an attraction towards Tsukune due to how delicious his blood is and would constantly ask if she could drink it. However, when Tsukune becomes tired from her always drinking it, she becomes worried over his condition and tries her best not to hurt him. However, when Tsukune allows her to drink it for her health, she hugs him and thanks him for it. The more time she spends around Tsukune, the more her feelings toward him grow.\n\nWhenever Tsukune tries to make her happy or willingly allows her to suck his blood for her health and happiness, she blushes and is very happy around him. When others mention how close the two are and if she has feelings for him, she blushes and is very bashful around him. Whenever she has the courage to ask him out on a date, she fidgets, and slightly stutters with him. When Tsukune's mother mentions how much Tsukune talks about her and likes her, she hugs him and even tries to kiss him. Eventually, her feelings develop into love. In a number of instances in the manga, she says directly to Tsukune that she loves him [Chapter 6 (during Tsukune's birthday); Chapter 11 (where she says that she loves him even if he will hate her).\n\nShe is very defensive of Tsukune due to him being only human, and wants to protect him so she can be with him. Moka even admits that she wishes to be with him. There is a running gag that whenever Moka gets close to Tsukune and looks as if the two are about to kiss, she bites his neck to suck his blood. However, she has more than once actually wanted to kiss him, but she is always interrupted by the others in the craziest of ways.\n\nPrior to the Inner Moka being sealed by the rosary, she and her sister Kokoa Shuzen had a rivalry in childhood. Kokoa became distressed when her beloved sister was sealed away and she spent the next few years chasing Outer Moka, wanting to kill her and get her sister back. While Inner Moka loves Kokoa as a sibling, she finds her \"too clingy.\" Outer Moka dislikes Kokoa's penchant for attacking her constantly in order to force out her other personality; until Tsukune appeared in her life she was never able to remove the rosary and fight back.\n\nWhen it comes to the Outer Moka, the Inner version is deeply close towards her as the two have a very strong bond who watch each others' backs. They share a lot in common (due to them being in each others' bodies). Inner tends to make sure that she eats, bathes and does her homework as usual and looks out for her well-being. Outer is the only person, aside from Tsukune, that she can open to, such as her worries over events and how the two feel about their love for Tsukune. According to Tsukune, he cares for both of them the same and hopes that one day inner and outer Moka can become one together. (Which happens in epilogue).\nInner Form\n\nHer vampiric nature also emerges when she is unsealed. Stern and reserved, she is highly aristocratic and arrogant, looking down upon all manner of yōkai for their audacity to challenge her. She normally punishes the monsters who dare pick on Tsukune for various reasons and depending on how they treated Outer, she'd even attempt to maim them. Her pride of being a noble vampiress is very apparent in how she deals with everything. She is very strong for a girl opposed, to her girly counterpart. In all accounts, she is a completely different from Outer Moka. She also possesses plenty of knowledge of the other classical types of monsters that attend Yōkai Academy.\n\nDespite her nature as a vampiress, she does not truly wish to kill anyone and is very merciful in fights. Even when unsealed, Inner Moka holds back to prevent herself from killing people. However, as a little girl Inner Moka was cheery and sociable - the traumatic events of her past and being sealed inside the rosary caused her to adopt a frosty attitude towards others.\n\nThis facade of superiority deteriorates throughout the course of the series, as her friendships with the other girls flourishes and her growing love for Tsukune deepens. When Tsukune began to deteriorate due to the repeated injections of Moka's blood, Inner attempted to have Tsukune leave Monster Academy, saying that she wouldn't be affected and couldn't care less. However, when Tsukune insists that Inner Moka is just as important to him as Outer Moka, Inner Moka distresses over Tsukune's condition and admits that she was only pushing him away because she didn't want him to die.\n\nUltimately, Tsukune succumbed to her blood, and Inner Moka was forced to fight a monstrous version of him. Although she attempted to be strong, Kurumu could tell Inner Moka was in distress and was faking her composure. In fighting the Ghoul, Inner Moka admitted that she would have wanted to keep Tsukune alive, but felt obligated to kill him for his sake, and broke into tears as she screamed his name when she came close to landing a killing blow. Fortunately, Tsukune was saved, but this moment of weakness revealed Inner Moka's true feelings about Tsukune and how much she had come to love him and care for her friends.\n\nAfterwards she and Outer Moka were sad over Tsukune's condition and Inner Moka blamed herself for hurting him, once again attempting to separate herself from Tsukune out of the belief she would only cause him pain. Throughout both seasons, Inner Moka tries to justify herself as a mechanism to protect her friends: by keeping distance between her and her friends even if she is the only one who suffers, not accepted and hated. Inner Moka's true intentions throughout the series was to protect Tsukune and thinks that she is only needed for fighting. As such, she wanted to stay as \"Inner Moka\" so she doesn't become weaker, one of the two reasons she was in a hurry to fix her seal only for \"Outer\" Moka to try to convince her otherwise, the two working together and filling each other's gaps.\n\nInner Moka tended to be slightly amused at Tsukune's attempts to assist her despite him being a 'mere human'. She claimed her personal interest in protecting him was due to his apparently tasty human blood, the primary source of nourishment for her body, but also to keep the sealed Moka happy. Even so, as Inner, she has never drank Tsukune's blood in the manga, leaving that task to Outer. Over the course of the series, Inner Moka begins to take her relationship with Tsukune more seriously, and is more aggressive whenever she appears on behalf of Tsukune, becoming angry when he is injured trying to protect her or Outer Moka. She even saves him a few times from blows that might have killed him at the cost of personal injury to herself. When Tsukune is horribly burnt trying to protect Outer Moka from Kuyō's supernatural flame, it was that time she actually threatened the life of a fellow student if her gambit at reviving him should fail. In the anime, this is shown when she forcibly bypasses the rosary's sealing power to strike back at Ruby who had mercilessly attacked Tsukune from behind.\n\nLater on, during the rare moments when she was not fighting, Inner is actually quite a normal girl to be around, despite her high upbringing. She is best described as very tomboyish, being prone to using violent or brash methods to get her point across. She is very smart, having been compared as slightly lower than the genius-level Yukari (solving complex math formulas and being bilingual with English as her 2nd language). Despite being very tomboyish most of the time, she can be quite feminine. She likes shopping for clothes and adores cute stuffed animals. She is also a bit of a tease, quite willing to show off her legs, but will allow nothing above 'holding of hands' at this point. She blames not being out nearly long enough to have any sort of practice in it. In the anime, Inner is a bit more socially awkward as well being obsessed with anything martial arts-related.\n\nThroughout the series, she comes to genuinely respect Tsukune's growing courage and gentle heart, especially after he risks his life several times in order to pull the rosary to free her when the both of them are in danger. His gentle and caring nature slowly begin to wear down on Inner's prideful and arrogant exterior, helping her form bonds with the rest of the group. She has noted that the more time she spends out in the world and around Tsukune, the softer she becomes and the more dependent she is on Tsukune and everyone else. Throughout both seasons Inner Moka began to invest more and more into her relationship with Tsukune as her feelings develop from friendship to love. Her protective nature becomes so intense that Inner Moka beings to retaliate without warning, like the time where she lashed out at Midou for insulting Tsukune in public. She also does unprecedented things like shielding Tsukune at her own expense and injecting him with her blood, even though she was aware of what it could do to him. These emotional developments come to fruition in Season II, where Inner Moka has changed tremendously in how she thinks of Tsukune and her emotions now blatantly express her love for him. Physical contact is embarrassing to her, although she typically hides it well, there are instances where her composure falters, like in chapter 16 when Tsukune suddenly embraces her. Her possessive nature of Tsukune grows to the point where she takes a role in the romantic competition, where she vehemently rejects the idea of polygamy along with Tsukune; and when Kurumu says that this was because she (Inner Moka) wants Tsukune to be hers alone, she blushes and quickly lashes out in embarrassment (Chapter 26, Rosario Vampire 23).\n\nAlthough Inner Moka is much more open and visibly smitten whenever she thinks about Tsukune, Inner Moka worries about her emotional evolution because she is starting to act like the Outer Moka and fears that she is losing her edge because of this, losing her proficiency to protect (and as a result, be with) Tsukune. Her love for Tsukune progresses mostly throughout Fairy Tale part of the series, where she opens her heart to him upon their reunion, and when she heavily worries for him during his transformation to a ghoul exhibiting emotional distress, where she cries and later begs for him not to turn into one throughout his crisis.\n\nWhen it comes to the Outer Moka, Inner is deeply close towards her, even though she's a fake personality. The two have a very strong bond and act almost like sisters who watch each other's backs. They both share a lot in common (due to them being in each others bodies). Inner tends to make sure that she eats, bathes and does her homework as usual and looks out for her well-being. Outer is the only person, aside from Tsukune, that she can open to, such as her worries over events and how the two feel about their love for Tsukune. According to Tsukune, he cares for both of them the same and hopes that one day Inner and Outer Moka can become one together.\n\nIssa elaborates that Outer Moka had never left, and that her personality and experiences were a part of Inner Moka and her soul, and as a result Inner Moka is bright and cheerful as her outer form. With this differentiation between Inner and Outer become pointless as Moka is finally free to be herself and openly love and protect Tsukune.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nEquipment\n\nRosario Cross (formerly): Moka's rosary cross is made of silver, but her touching it doesn't give her pain, rather, it disrupts her yōkai, causing her to become weak. It was created by Akasha Bloodriver (Moka's mother) to protect her from Alucard's blood.\nWeakness\n\nLack of Blood: Due to Moka's strength originating from her blood, if she loses it by injecting it to another or deprived of it her overall power significantly decreases.\nWater: Moka's greatest weakness (and the one of any vampiress in general) is water. Due to its purifying properties, it has an adverse effect on her body, causing painful shocks and rendering her virtually immobile. However, it is possible to negate the weakening and harmful effects by adding certain herbs to the water (as seen when she makes breakfast for Tsukune Aono or when she takes a bath)."

In the first semester she confessed her love to Okuto Kotsubo (Mizore's teacher), who then began to take advantage of her, which leads Mizore to freeze him. With the incident rumors spreading about her, but after meeting Tsukune Aono and becoming friends with everyone after a short about between her and the vampire named Moka Akashiya, Mizore is shown to be a calm and reserved girl with little emotion, which she only expresses when having moments with Tsukune. She starts to love Tsukune so much that she wants to have babies with him, even if she has to force him.\n\nShe is often seen stalking and hiding in different locations, which is often played up for comedic effects. (She often hides in amusing places; in bushes, under tables and occasionally within furniture). In addition, she gets into comedic arguments with Kurumu Kurono quite often, and they are often seen butting heads or having childish fist fights, though they remain to be close friends. For instance, when Mizore is forcefully kissed by Miyabi Fujisaki, Kurumu comforts her and prevents Mizore from committing suicide.\n\nMizore has several running gags; she prevents Moka and Tsukune from having tender moments together by flinging ice projectiles at them. Also, she appears unexpectedly in seemingly impracticable and/or otherwise unexpected places.\n\nIn the manga, we discover that Snow Women cannot have children after a certain age and Mizore is almost married off to Miyabi because of her village's practices. However, she's rescued by Tsukune and the others.\n\nAfter Tsukune saves Mizore from getting killed by Kotsubo, her love for Tsukune becomes even stronger to the point that she admits that she loves him and wants to have children with him. Mizore even sneaks away from her side of the P.E. class to see Tsukune do his exercises. When doing so, she blushes, usually saying, \"Tsukune, that was great.\" She sometimes refers to him as her \"Beloved\", to the point that it becomes somewhat habitual as the series progresses.\n\nUnder the influence of Lilith's Mirror Mizore acts in a very perverted manner; Talking about her breasts and flashing Tsukune. She describes her nipples as \"like cherries\" extensively.\n\nMizore may be the most sensitive when it comes to how many friends Tsukune has. On the occasion when Fang Fang tries to get Tsukune to join his family, she replied that if he gets one more friend to contest her love for him, she's going to stab him.\n\nStill she is very calm and reserved\nManga\n\nYear One\n\nWhen we are first introduced to Mizore, we find out she has been obsessing about Tsukune Aono from afar where she tries to gain his affection by explaining to him that both of them were lonely, but Tsukune releases Inner Moka who kicks Mizore hard enough to stun her. Later that night two boys heading back to the dorm from their club heard and then saw a despondent Mizore. Upset, Mizore froze them in an emotional outburst. The next day Mr. Kotsubo said she'd not only frozen them but also seriously wounded them. When Tsukune told her what was said, Mizore admitted that she froze them in a huff but simmered down and thawed them, leaving them unharmed. Sad that Tsukune would think she'd hurt innocent people, she ran off to the cliffs alone. Mr. Kotsubo tried to attack her, but she accidentally pushed him off the cliff. He then assumed his true form (a kraken) and proceed to say he would kill Mizore, who realized he'd framed her. She hated Moka initially as Moka \"got in her way\" when it came to Tsukune's complete affection, but she eventually regains her sense of trust. After being saved she also begins stalking Tsukune on a daily basis.\n\nYear Two\n\nDuring the summer before the second year, Mizore and Kurumu Kurono train with Ginei Morioka, practicing melee combat in an effort for the two to become strong enough to overcome Inner Moka in a fight. They have joint attacks called \"Black and White\" duet. In a later chapter, Mizore returns to her village, where there is a white flower which is used to lure the opposite sex. Mizore almost gets Tsukune Aono (Mizore is last seen hugging Tsukune on the ground with no clothes). She is then taken by the Snow Goddess and brought to the Snow Palace. There she is told she must marry Miyabi Fujisaki from the group Fairy Tale. Miyabi sexually assaults Mizore, causing Mizore to think of herself as unfit for Tsukune.\n\nA later scene reveals she tried fighting back as the audience is shown a lot of ice shards scattered across the room. Still feeling as though she'll never again be suitable for Tsukune, she attempts suicide by jumping out of the window of the room she's found in. Kurumu dives after her and saves her just in time. Mizore begs Kurumu to let her go because she was kissed by a different man than the one she dreams of (Tsukune). Kurumu unexpectedly locks Mizore in a long, passionate kiss, trying to convince her that things will be okay and that she can still go on. Mizore returns to her quest to lure Tsukune (as his stalker). In Chapter 40, Mizore shows growth in maturity by saying that whether Tsukune chooses her as his lover or not, she will continue to be Tsukune's lover/stalker forever. She also notes that Kurumu can't deal with the possibility of Tsukune choosing Moka or another girl, since being a Succubus, being rejected by her Destined One will kill her.\n\nAnime\n\nYear One\n\nMizore returns to school after a delayed absence and shows an immediate interest in Tsukune Aono. In truth, she becomes infatuated with him, going so far as to create her own journal/scrapbook with all of his newspaper articles. She truly hated Moka Akashiya at first since she \"got in her way\" but she eventually regains her sense of trust, after Tsukune saved her from her loneliness. Unfortunately, this leads Mizore to stalk Tsukune on a daily basis. During the last few episodes of the season, she finds out (indirectly from Tsukune) that Tsukune is human. After that, she runs to the place where Tsukune saved her from her loneliness and starts to think about everything that has happened, wondering what she should do. Ruby Tōjō appears out of nowhere in her Raven form and helps to convince her to help him. She, along with Kurumu Kurono, Yukari Sendo, Moka and Ruby decide to stop the execution and save their beloved Tsukune, even if it meant losing their own lives.\n\nYear Two\n\nDuring Year Two, Mizore still harbors feelings for Tsukune Aono and still stalks him. In one episode, she tries to attract Tsukune by learning how to cook curry, she becomes pretty decent at it, although it took hard work, and ends up making the curry in her own, signature way by using ice crystals instead of rice. Later on, she asks Tsukune to pretend to be her boyfriend for the sake of her mom, who starts getting ideas of marriage. While visiting the human realm, she, along with everyone else in Tsukune's harem (excluding Ruby) meets his mother. She battles Kurumu Kurono and Yukari Sendo to see who is more deserving of Tsukune (which ends with them all losing to Inner Moka). During the last few episodes, it is revealed through the Lilith Mirror, that her greatest desire is to be with Tsukune. However, he tells her, and everyone else (excluding Moka who was not with them at the time) that no one can replace Moka and that no one can replace them either. After that, together they overcome the effects of the mirror and defeat the spirit of the mirror.\n\nAfter beating the spirit, the barrier that isolated the worlds from each other starts to fall apart and Moka sacrifices her rosary to stabilize the barrier. About a week later, Mizore can't stand to see Tsukune in so much pain, so she calls her mom and makes plans to have him marry into their family. A while after, everyone realizes that Tsukune left the school to see one of the Dark Lords and get another rosary for Moka. However, Tsurara Shirayuki decides to intervene as it would hinder her plans to have him marry into their family. But Mizore comes out of nowhere and says that she will stop her mom and do what she must for the one she loves because that is what she feels she must do. After the confrontation, she, along with everyone, finally witnesses Tsukune revive the Outer Moka and the two hug each other. At the end of the series, everyone, including Inner Moka (who was unleashed due to her sister stealing the Mirror again) holds Tsukune tightly."

Akasha looks a lot like Outer Moka as they both have the same traits; the same skin color, pink hair color and green eye color. Akasha is sometimes depicted with red eyes instead of green.\n\nShe wears a large Victorian-styled gown that is black, along with heeled platforms. Under her dress is a battle uniform which consists of a revealing corset, black shorts and garters.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPersonality\n\nAkasha appears to have a similar personality to both Outer Moka and Inner Moka. Akasha is shown to be kind and gentle towards other people and cares greatly for them; even her husband's other lovers, which is similar to how Outer Moka would react.\n\nBut when fighting, Akasha becomes more like Inner Moka as she has the same fighting style just like her daughter.\n\nAccording to Touhou Fuhai, Akasha's tender-hearted nature could also be a drawback. As he stated in the flashback of Moka's past, Akasha's nature inhibited her battle prowess. Her given name goes before her family name, unlike Moka Akashiya and the rest of the Shuzen family. Although not a biological or blood-related Shuzen member, Akasha does serve a lot of purpose to the storylines in the manga chapters and volumes of Season II. Touhou Fuhai describes Akasha as a strong, but sad woman who carries a heavy burden. She is also mainly a stepmother to the Shuzen Family.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nHistory\n\nAkasha was a small child in 15th century Wallachia. Her kingdom had been destroyed by humans, and only she and her king, Dracula, survived the carnage. Her king would then rename himself Alucard, and work to avenge what became of his homeland and his people.\n\nHowever, due to Akasha still hoping for peace between humans and monsters, Alucard separated from her to fulfill his goal for vengeance to rebuild his lost kingdom; and when they met again, the two became enemies to see which of their goals would triumph.  \nManga\n\nAkasha first appears in Rosario + Vampire II Chapter 029. According to Akua, Akasha is currently believed to be residing inside Alucard, which is itself held in the Floating Garden, Fairy Tale's Headquarters. Akua also states that she has possibly merged with Alucard because of the time that has past, this has yet to be proven.\n\nLater on, it is revealed by Gyokuro that when Akasha, Touhou and Tenmei Mikogami were fighting Alucard many years ago, they were unable to defeat him. So Akasha allowed herself to be devoured in order to seal him from the inside. 170 years later, Akasha is rescued by the Shuzen Family; but due to being inside Alucard for all that time, her Yōki and even her blood had combined with Alucard's. This caused them to become synchronized. She would later pass the Shinso blood into her daughter, Moka, to save her life, and eventually it was passed into Tsukune by Moka.\n\nDuring the battle against Fairy Tale in Gyokuro's flashback, Akasha tells Issa that she plans to make a world where humans and monsters can coexist with Issa who agreed with her that when the time comes for that they will all live together in the human world.\n\nAkasha is later revived when Tsukune attaches the Rosario she made to Alucard's chest. She then binds Alucard and takes control of his main body. She told her former king that their journey had gone on long enough and that it had to end. And while they sought different goals (vengeance versus peace) it was for the same reason. To create a utopia where humans and monsters could live peacefully with each other. \"And now,\" she went on, as she gazed at her daughter and Tsukune, \"our dream has been passed on to a new generation.\" She watched as her former king finally relinquished his obsession and agreed to end their existence together.\n\nMoka called out to her, clearly against at the thought of losing her mother again. At that time, Akua stepped forth, and revealed that Outer Moka was actually Akasha, who'd erased her own memories in order to protect her daughter as a personality.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPowers and Abilities\n\nVampirism: Akasha is one of the two progenitors of the Shinso bloodline in the world with Alucard being the other which makes her one of the most powerful characters in the series. A sign of her strength is that she is recognized as the leader of the Three Dark Lords meaning her power is viewed to be greater than that of Tenmei Mikogami and Touhou Fuhai who are similarly very powerful monsters themselves despite not being vampires. Her power is demonstrated in fact that she needed help from the other two Dark Lords when fighting Alucard at full strength when he absorbed countless other monsters but was able to swiftly seal Alucard a second time on her own while fighting him in a starved state when he briefly reawakened. This being most notable as Akasha was the only character able to contend against Alucard singlehandedly when all other adversaries of the older Shinso Vampire needed to ally and fight together against him.\nImmense Strength: Akasha has demonstrated some of the powerful feats of physical strength in the series, perhaps second to that of Alucard himself. 7 years ago, after her recent fight with Akua, she was able to effortlessly slash apart Alucard's tentacles with her bare hands while Akua needed to use her Jigen-Tou technique for the same result all the while still regenerating from being bisected. Later during the fight against Alucard, Akasha was able to completely destroy his body altogether with her kicks to the extent that they weren't able to regenerate from the sheer damage which left Akua herself completely astonished by the feat. This being most notable because both Tsukune and Moka, two recent full-fledged Shinso Vampires, using the Creation ability to create armaments to explode on contact with their target in addition to their greatly enhanced strength weren't able to accomplish this same feat at all. Though it should be noted that Akasha was fighting Alucard when he just recently awakened in a starving state while Tsukune and Moka were fighting him after he regained his full strength and merged with his clone who seemingly increased Alucard already immense power.\nImmense Speed and Reflexes: Akasha was able to dodge most of Akua's super speed attacks, in fact the only reason that Akua even managed to land those attacks on Akasha in the first place was because Akasha's power restrictions and the elder vampire never had any real intent on fighting Akua. Also is the fact Akua was only able to bisect Akasha when the Dark Lord was momentarily distracted by Moka's unexpected interruption towards their battle. In the battle against Alucard to rescue Moka, Akasha is capable of dodging Alucard's tentacles and damaging him in the process; however, she did not dodge his last attack due to knowing what she had to do to seal him up again.\nImmense Agility: As in accordance with her speed Akasha has demonstrated great agility being able to dodge all of Alucard's attacks whilst in mid-air. In fact, Akasha was able to swiftly retaliate against Alucard's tentacles with numerous kicks in a second while in mid-air and performed several acrobatic movements during her fight with Akua as well.\nImmense Stamina: Akasha's body produces considerably less fatigue toxins than that of both humans and monsters including her fellow vampires as she's able to exert herself beyond the limits of even vampires. 200 years ago, it is said that Akasha and the other two Dark Lords fought against Alucard non-stop for many days before she sealed him from the inside. Her stamina is furthered shown when she was able to easily save Akua from Alucard's tentacles all the while still regenerating from her bisection which completely surprised the younger vampire then. Also, she was able to perform the sealing ceremony on Moka to seal her Shinso blood in order to seal Alucard just after briefly fighting against him that required using tremendous enough strength to destroy his body without showing any fatigue.\nImmense Durability and Endurance: Akasha displayed incredible endurance, physical resistance, and pain tolerance more so than most other characters in the series. This was first shown in her fight against Akua where she easily endured Akura's Jigen-Tou attacks without showing any signs of outward pain or reaction despite them destroying sections of the Shuzen mansion. She also only showed small discomfort and grimacing while regenerating from Akua's bisection of her after saving the younger vampire from Alucard. Later on, during her fight against Alucard 7 years ago, Akasha also willingly endured the older Shinso's last attack which involved being pierced by many of his tentacles at the same time with only a small of pain being shown in order to reach Moka. Also, while performing the sealing ceremony on Moka, Akasha displayed no outward reaction to Alucard's constriction of her with his tentacles while explaining to Moka the details of the sealing before being eaten.\nHigh-Speed Regeneration: As demonstrated when she was cut by Akua early in their battle, Akasha showed a remarkable regenerative factor. In only a matter of moments, gaping wounds were sealed up, leaving her none the worse for the wear. Even being bisected by Akua failed to keep her down as it took only a few minutes for her to pull herself back together, much to Akua's complete and utter surprise with Akasha remarking that her body is much sturdier than most would believe. As of now, Akasha is the only one seen with this level of regeneration besides Alucard.\nShinso Bloodline: Akasha is well known for being a progenitor of a Shinso bloodline with the other being Alucard himself. This bloodline gives Akasha a legendary power described as a \"darkness deeper than night\". Due to the 170 years of time, she spent sleeping inside Alucard in order to seal him from the inside out, their Shinso blood mixed together and became synchronized. Gyokuro stated that this combination poses a danger level beyond imagination. After fusing with Alucard again for 7 years Akasha gained control over his body being able to wrest control of it when Tsukune provided the catalyst for her resurrection by placing Moka's broken Rosary on Alucard's chest with him referring to her as a bomb inside him.\nImmortality: As a progenitor of a Shinso bloodline, Akasha is near immortal as she is one of two oldest characters being over 500 years old, second to that of Alucard, and according to herself is very hard to keep down demonstrated when recovering from Akua's bisection which only briefly incapacitated her for a few minutes while both Moka and Akua believing she was killed. This suggests that ordinary vampires would die from such a fatal wound despite their regenerative healing while Akasha easily survived this attempt on her life. Also, she willingly allowed herself to be devoured by Alucard twice in order to seal him from the inside and surviving both times within his body with the first being recused by the Shuzen family after 170 years of slumbering and other after Tsukune placed Moka's rosary cross on Alucard which allowed her to resurrect herself from his body. This being most notable as all other monsters Alucard devoured and absorbed quickly died from such including vampires such as Gyokuro Shuzen who willingly fused herself to Alucard only to be devoured and killed after losing the rosary cross to Moka.\nBlood Transfusion: As a vampire, Akasha can transfer her own blood into another being if she has to by using her fangs. In a brief flashback, Akasha transferred as much of her blood into the baby Moka in order to save her sick daughter's life shortly after her birth.  \nWealth of Power: Yukari states that all vampires and vampiresses have an ability called \"Wealth of Power.\" Yukari also stated that most vampires have rejected this ability in spite of its tremendous potential due to their innate narcissism and vanity. In Akasha's Shinso form upon her revival, she is able to grow six gigantic bat wings with the lowering pair being larger than the one on top.\nAbilities\n\nMaster Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Akasha's fighting style is identical to how Inner Moka fights, with a variety of Tae Kwon Do kicks, but the difference in raw power and skill that Akasha is capable of generating is exponentially staggering. She also passed on to Moka her signature catchphrase of \"Know Your Place\" when kicking an enemy down which suggests that Akasha had personally taught to her daughter this fighting style that Moka uses to this day. During the battle against Alucard 200 years ago, Akasha required help from both Mikogami and Fuhai in order to temporarily defeat and seal Alucard away while 7 years ago during his brief reawakening in a starving state, she was able to swiftly deal with Alucard on her own in order to reach Moka and seal her Shinso blood. Touhou Fuhai stated that Akasha is also known as the \"Nosferatu\" due to practically nothing being able to kill her when she fights seriously thus proving that had she been serious and able to use her true power, Akua wouldn't have been able to briefly defeat her at all.\nBlack Arts Expert: Possibly having learned from fellow Dark Lord Touhou Fuhai or perhaps self-taught, Akasha has some expertise of black arts in particular with seals as she created Moka's Rosario Cross that sealed Moka's Shinso blood and memories. This seal also houses an artificial personality cloned from Akasha herself. In fact when she created the rosary, Akasha also built in a connection between her and the rosary allowing her protect Moka from lethal blows originating from Alucard's body while inside him. When Tsukune pressed the broken Rosario Cross to Alucard's chest Akasha was also able to use that opportunity to revive herself from his flesh as well.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nMother's Love\n\nAkasha and Moka\nAkasha and young Moka\nWhen Moka was born, she was on the verge of death. To save her, Akasha transfused as much of her blood as possible in order to revive her. An unexpected result was that her Shinso power transferred into Moka, saving her from certain death. Akasha's love for Moka was so powerful that she specially made a Rosario Cross for Moka; to lock away her Shinso blood, and thus prevent Moka from awakening Alucard to give her a chance at a normal life, not involved with Alucard.\n\nAs fate would have it, Moka went insane upon seeing her mother cut in half by her sister and awoke her powers; at the same time awakening Alucard from its slumber. To save Moka, Akasha gave her life to activate the seal, placing the fake personality \"Outer Moka\" which was herself, in place of her daughter, and was subsequently absorbed into Alucard to \"seal him from the inside\".\n"

It is the club in which the main cast of Rosario + Vampire is a part of.\n\n\nYear One\n\nDuring the time when the students of Yōkai Academy had to pick a club, Nekonome-sensei asked for students to join her club, as it was in risk of being shut down. Later on, Tsukune thought about joining the club when Nekonome-sensei asked him about it until Moka said she would. Seeing that Tsukune and Moka had joined the club, so did Kurumu.\n\nSometime later, Tsukune, Kurumu, and Moka met the club's President. Over the next few days, Gin made Moka and Kurumu believe that Tsukune was a \"peeper\" so that he could make Moka \"his woman\". Once Gin was defeated, the Club ran an extra about how Tsukune was innocent and that Gin was the real peeper. \n\nYukari later joined the club after Moka and Tsukune has saved her from her Class Representative. Later, the club began to investigate the mysterious disappearances of some of the girls on campus. The culprit was revealed to be Ishigami-sensei, who, according to the club's article, was indefinitely suspended while the kidnapped girls were safely returned.\n\nTwo days later, the Newspaper Club was busy working on meeting their deadline when Kurumu received a threatening note from Nagare. Later, when Kurumu refused to go on another date with him, he took everything that the club had been working on before Kurumu left to confront Nagara. Yukari found Nagare's letter in a toolbox, leading to the club going in search of Kurumu. When the club was in danger, Kurumu attacked and defeated Nagare, as well as getting their stuff back.\n\nThe Newspaper Club is then seen the day after, passing out copies of their newspaper to the student body. They had given out half of their papers when the Public Safety Commission appears and demands who gave them permission to do so before Kuyō destroys their stand. Later, Gin tells the more about the group before ordering them to burn the newspapers to show that they won't resist. Kurumu, however, leaves with the last of the newspapers with Tsukune, who tried to reason with her. The newspapers are destroyed during a confrontation with Keito, who reveals the fate of last year's Newspaper Club.\n\nThe next day, the Public Safety Commission arrests Moka (for assaulting Keito) and Tsukune (for suspicion of being a Human). Gin tries to convince Yukari and Kurumu that it would be best not to associate themselves with Tsukune, lest they be destroyed, they stubbornly refuse and go off to save him and Moka. Gin later comes in to help them, saying he wouldn't let anyone lay a hand on his friends.\n\nDespite Gin's help and later sacrifice, Kuyō defeats the Newspaper Club and almost kills Tsukune until Inner Moka awakens. She injects her blood into Tsukune and holds off Kuyo until, together with Tsukune, they defeat him.\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nAnime\n\nThis article is a stub.

She initially disliked Tsukune Aono, claiming that she had fallen in love with Moka Akashiya and used her magical powers to try to drive them apart. However, after both Tsukune and Moka save her from bullying classmates, she falls for him too. Her obsession with both has driven her to try to create a three-way relationship between them (though shortly after Fang Fang's introduction, she attempted to create a larger relationship involving Kurumu and Mizore as well.) Yukari has, on occasion, developed some bizarre items, often leading to funny results or far-fetched situations.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nYukari tends to have a playful personality. Seeing as she started high school when she was eleven, this is not much of a surprise. She is very cheerful and optimistic about most things. When she initially went to school, the other students were ruthlessly prejudiced against her, hurting her feelings and causing her to lash back at them with pranks. Yukari often gets into arguments with Kurumu over whether it is better to be flat-chested, but she seems to embrace her flatchested-ness. Her name \"Yukari\" which is \"紫\" can also be pronounced as \"mursaki\", and can be translated to \"purple\".\n\nShe's also smart in school as well.\n\nDespite being young, Yukari seems to \"swing both ways\" when it comes to love; she cares for Tsukune and Moka equally. As she is flat-chested, Yukari joyously squeezed Moka's own, claiming that compared to her own, Moka's breasts are a dream to have. Unlike the other girls, by the time Fang Fang was introduced, Yukari has become accustomed to the idea of being a harem and doesn't want Tsukune to end things.\n\nWhen Yukari's personality had been switched into Fang Fang's body with her Ishin Denshin, she became unsure of herself. She began to think that Tsukune viewed her as a younger sister and \"not a woman\". Tsukune, however corrected her (Thinking he was talking to Fang Fang) and told her how her knowledge and magic had saved them numerous times and that she was one of his most-trusted friends.\n\nThis admission caused Yukari to tear up before she admitted that she had needed the Ishin Denshin because she had never conveyed her feelings to Tsukune. She then admitted to Tsukune (While she appeared to be an older version of herself) that she loved him.\n\nUnder the influence of Lilith's Mirror, Yukari acts in a very perverted manner such as trying to get Tsukune to feel her up, which unlike the other girls, is a bit more innocent in comparison. But Tsukune mentions that they are dangerously getting close to bordering on kiddie porn.\nAppearances\n\nYukari is the shortest in the group besides Kokoa Shuzen. She has short black hair and purple eyes. At school, she wears does wear a uniform, but instead, a witch's typical outfit or properly, \"witch's outfit\", but she still sports the same uniform skirt. She wears a black witch hat that droops down sometimes, a pink top, and a pink corset. She wears the green checkered pleated short skirt all female students wear, and wears bright pale yellow over the knee socks, and brown shoes. In the second serialization, her \"uniform skirt\" had an undergo from the skirt of the school's uniform to a dark-colored waist-length-to-belly-length skirt or \"shirt-holder\" which its color is unknown due to the manga illustrations appearing in black-and-white. She's usually more than not seen holding her magic wand.\n\nIn Capu2 in the anime, when she was magically given an older form, she was as tall as Moka but had larger breasts (but were still smaller than Kurumu’s by just a bit). Her uniform was a plain, white shirt, with a red bow tie, and a yellow ribbon on/in her hair, the green pleated skirt that all female students wear, and short low-heeled \"flats\" that are \"Mary Jane\" black shoes.\nManga\n\nYear One\n\nWhen she first got to Yōkai Academy, the students there were prejudiced against her because she was a witch. Yukari bottled up her feelings of loneliness and hurt, and began getting revenge on the other students by pulling pranks on them. By the time of the midterms, Yukari had seen Moka numerous times and had fallen for her. After being saved by both Moka and Tsukune from the Class President, she decided that she was in love with both of them; she also joined the Newspaper Club.\n\nAround June, Yukari was next seen dropping objects on Gin and Kurumu's heads to keep them away from Tsukune and Moka. She also interrupted one of Tsukune's chances to ask out Moka. By the 21st, Yukari was helping with the missing girls case and found a dread energy clinging to Tsukune and Moka via her crystal ball. Knowing her predictions were normally right, Yukari was relieved Tsukune was safe prior to him figuring out Ms. Ishigami was behind the case. On Tsukune's birthday, Yukari gave Tsukune a voodoo doll as a gift.\n\nShe was later stuck in the Newspaper Club during the weekend to get the July edition finished. The club's hard work was nearly ruined by a slug monster obsessed with Kurumu (who even read the diary on her laptop). However, the paper was successfully finished prior to Monday morning.\n\nYukari then helped hand out papers to the students, ending up being chased by boys who liked how cute she was. The Public Safety Commission arrived and trashed the newspapers because they didn't pay a bribe to hand them out. Yukari later helped mend Tsukune's wound from Keito's attack on them.\n\nWhen Yukari first heard the charge about Tsukune being human, despite Kurumu's thinking that the charge was absurd, Yukari said that Tsukune's wound was healing so slowly...just like a human. Despite realizing that the charge was highly valid, Yukari still went to the Enforcers shrine-like base to save Tsukune, proving that even though Tsukune was human, his kindness had made a big enough impression on her to look past humanity's cruel mistreatment of witches for the sake of her good friend.\n\nYear Two\n\nYukari met Fang Fang Huang who she thought was an idiot. When Fang Fang switched their personalities with the Ishin Denshin, Yukari saw herself from another point of view and became filled with anxiety. When Tsukune misunderstood Yukari's bid (while in Fang Fang's body) to reclaim her own body, Yukari had an emotional meltdown. Voicing all her fears about how Tsukune viewed her, Yukari was shocked when Tsukune rebuked her (thinking he was talking to Fang Fang) for that viewpoint. He then affirmed his value of Yukari and that he trusted her implicitly. After time passed, she became more understanding toward Fang Fang and eventually became his friend. She actually worries about Fang Fang about his leadership of the Huang family and when he is injured.\n\nWhen Akua announced her bid to help Tsukune after he'd removed his Holy Lock, Yukari realized the intention wasn't to revert Tsukune to a human, but rather to give him the final push to help him become someone capable of controlling his powers. When she said this Fang-Fang was seen with a confused/baffled expression. She then joined circle of friends to help Tsukune and Moka. When the smoke cleared showing Tsukune and Moka alive as fully realized Shinso, Yukari was part of the celebration for their survival.\n\nAnime\n\nYear One\n\nYukari's first appearance was in episode 3, when all the students are reading the test ranks and she comes first. She later injures Tsukune Aono while he is in the infirmary. She uses a voodoo doll on Kurumu and makes Tsukune touch Kurumu's breasts and pull down her panties whilst Moka Akashiya is in the room. She gets caught by the three and later bumps into the Lizardman. She gets taken to the forest to be eaten but saved by Tsukune, Moka and Kurumu, then she falls in love with Tsukune. In episode 9 she meets a fellow witch called Ruby Toujo who thinks all humans are the enemy. But eventually the group convinces Ruby that's not the case.\n\nYear Two\n\nYukari meets a nurse who charms her and makes her more developed. But in the end, Yukari learns that Tsukune only cares about what's on the inside, so she decides to go back to her old self.\n\nBackground\n\nYukari has a sad history. She was always wanting to pull pranks and monsters hated her because she is a witch. She got picked on by lizardmen, a form of lizard monsters, for being a witch. Inner Moka and Tsukune save her, though. She was then not only in love with Moka but Tsukune as well.\n\nIn season two, she dreams of having a threesome with Tsukune and Moka. In Season Two, she meets Fang Fang who she is happy to teach and train with. Fang Fang Huang is her pupil to teach.\n\nShe gets along with Fang Fang, but calls him an idiot. In the anime, a bunch of Lizardmen take her, pushed to her back to a tree, and prepare to eat her. Moka and Tsukune save her from this.\n\nIn the manga, Yukari and the group go to visit the Snow Village where Mizore Shirayuki is from. She meets Kahlua Shuzen who can transform her arm into a bat wing, and Yukari states that vampires can change into animal form, but the ability is lost due to their vanity. Yukari survives Kahlua's blows, and then learns of the Belmont Whip that Ruby had for Tsukune.\nEquipment and Magical Items\n\nMagic Wand: As Yukari's magic requires an outside medium she mainly uses a magic wand with a star on the top center as her primary weapon.\nSummoning: Yukari later used her wand as her focusing medium her Summoning Techniques by placing a talisman on it.\nWarawara-kun: A voodoo doll. If someone's hair is placed inside of it, it will allow Yukari to control that person through the doll. She may have more than one of these dolls, as she gave Tsukune one for his birthday in the manga.\nHorehore-kun: An urn that was used on Moka. It releases all of the heart's reasoning and purity and acts like an aphrodisac. It was first used on Moka.\nIshin Denshin:A magical item that Yukari invented to allow people to relay their feelings without the use of words. However, when the dial is switched to maximum, it switches people's personalities.\nIshin Denshin: Bazooka Form:A variation of Yukari's Ishin Denshin. It was used to fire a beam that switched Yukari and Fang Fang's personalities back.\nPowers and Abilities\n\nWitch Physiology: Yukari is essentially a borderline yokai where witches are basically humans capable of magic and thus is seen as half yokai and half human. As a Witch, Yukari can cast various spells through her magic wand, with her motif usually revolving around tarot cards and washtubs. Due to her kind having a body identical to that of a human, their physical prowess aren't high compared to other yokai though they make up for this with the magic they wield.\nMagic: Yukari's signature magic is seen more as comedic due to it revolving around tarot cards and washtubs though if she gets it to hit right then it serve well in combat. She can also use her wand to manipulate various objects and use them as weapons, as with the case where she uses brooms to drive away Tsukune in her introductory chapter. A running gag throughout the series is where she often drops a washtub on someone who is annoying, usually Kurumu or Mizore (and Gin on rare occasions. Once she dropped a giant spiked ball on him for saying \"Hi Tsukune\") [The spiked ball occurred when Tsukune's Cousin Kyoko visited the school & everyone before him blabbed about the school's true nature].\nEnhanced Durability: Despite her stature and human-like body, Yukari has enough durability to survive an attack from the likes of Miyabi Fujisaki (whom is a clone of Alucard himself) though was left incapacitated for some time.\nEnhanced Stamina: Yukari has enough endurance to compete against Xia-Long Miao, a summoning prodigy in Summoning Techniques (an art that requires large amount of stamina and Yoki) for some time before the summons began to consume her life force. Even when she was incapacitated by the life force drain, Yukari can still muster the strength to perform one last summon to aid Fang-Fang in defeating Xia-Long Miao. After surviving Gairen Yuki's attempt at killing her, Fang-Fang, Xia-Long, and Routier, Yukari later aid Fang-Fang in defeating the Sub-Division leader despite having little rest from her earlier fight.\nAbilities\n\nExpert Spell Caster: Yukari is quite powerful as a witch in spite of her young age and has great potential given the right motivation, one instance is when she defeats an army of monster plants by herself during the Witch's Knoll Arc.\nGenius Intellect: Yukari is noted as the smartest student in all of Yokai Academy being able to skip a couple of grades to be in the same class as the older members of the Newspaper Club. Due to Inner Moka being the only one to solve a legendary math problem that is said to be solve only by Yukari, then it can be assumed that only Inner Moka can rival or even surpass Yukari in intellect out of the entire student body. In fact even someone as cunning as Hokuto Kaneshiro acknowledged Yukari's intellect, praising her for it in that with her perception things progress much quicker. Also her intellect allows her greater talent and understanding than most of the other Newspaper Club members.\nExpert Inventor: She has a knack for creating things for her goals, she once created an urn which enabled Outer Moka to express her true feelings, a small strange machine to tell how one person fells with out using words, and \"Sukusuku Drops\" (Growth Drops/Gro-Gro drops) that induce a \"Forced Metamorphosis\" that gives the consumer an \"adult\" body via affecting the Yokai Shape-shifting ability for 12 minutes and 13 seconds. Each item seemed to have went a bit wrong, like the Drops making reducing you to a young child for a few days after time is up.\nExpert Summoner: During the one month training with Fang Fang, she self-taught herself the Summoning Techniques and became far better at it than Fang Fang. However if she over uses the techniques, she lose stamina very quickly since it requires a lot of yōkai energy as noted by Xia-Long Miao to be a beginner's mistake. Though despite this Yukari shows enough expertise in the art to compete against a summoning prodigy like Xia-Long Miao despite having trained for only a month something commented on by his servant, Routier.\nTechniques\n\nMagic Spells: Yukari's magic spells are centered around a certain theme like most witches though most of them are more for comedic relief rather than practicality or combat probably due to her young age.\nGolden Washtubs:Yukari summons golden washtubs above her opponents' head to knock them out. This is one of her most used summons.\nTarot Cards:Yukari summons many tarot cards and they slice the opponent. When Yukari is determined in battle her tarot cards can become sharp enough to slice through monsters such as the plant monsters of the witch's kroll.\nSummons: Most if not all of Yukari's summons are based on insects which makes it a perfect counter against Xia-Long Miao's flower summons.\nEn'enmushi (Flame King of Snails): A snail that Yukari used to defend Fong-Fong from \"Gun's and Roses\" which also uses the gas stored in its body to create fire to burn through Xia-Long's flower summons.\nBees: Yukari summons a swarm of bees, alongside butterflies and a centipede, in her duel against Xia-Long.\nButterflies: Yukari summons butterflies, bees, and a centipede in her duel against Xia-Long.\nCentipede: Yukari summons a centipede, butterflies, and a swarm of bees in her duel against Xia-Long.\nHagene Zatoumushi (Steel Daddy Long-legs): A defensive summon that Yukari summons to protect Fang Fang Huang where she summons a giant daddy long-legs spider with steel-like legs to deflect blade attacks."

However, her desire to do so was sparked by the death of Jasmine (Akua's best friend) at the hands of humans that Akua now seeks to help Moka and wants her sister to be happy.\n\n\nAppearance\n\nAkua has pale skin, red eyes with slits for pupils, and deep-black hair held into two pigtails or ponytails. She is often seen wearing the traditional Chinese cheongsam, her preferred black attire with black knee-high combat boots.\n\nAccording to Touhou Fuhai, Akua hasn’t grown in all the years that have passed since Outer Moka was created by the Rosario Cross, as he pointed out her small breast size. She hates being reminded about this, reacting in embarrassment which promoted Akua is possibly the second shortest girl out of the four sisters of the Shuzen.\nPersonality\n\nAlthough Akua is brutal in terms of strength, she seems to truly care for her sisters, particularly Moka Akashiya, whom she loves very much. She has shown a reluctance in fighting, stating that she didn’t want to kill Akasha Bloodriver in front of Moka, and by doing so, it would sadden her. She has a very dark and violent side, and will annihilate anyone who gets in her way. She goes as far as to threaten the lives of Tsukune Aono and his friends, if Moka didn’t get on Fairy Tale’s ship. While she is truly kind towards Moka, she isn’t afraid to harm those around her, including her mother, friends, and the person she believes to be Moka’s “partner in marriage”, claiming herself to be the only one Moka truly has, and states in return that Moka’s all she herself has. When she fought Tsukune in a one-on-one battle, he saw into Akua’s heart; deep inside, she’s a little girl crying for love. It’s revealed that years before in China she lived in a human society with her ‘friend’ Jasmine. They hid their identities of being vampires but the humans suspected Akua as one for hurting someone that Jasmine liked. When Jasmine went to the village to explain, the villagers refused to listen, then tortured and skewered her. Jasmine looked very much like Moka; probably the reason that Akua truly loves Moka. Even years later, Akua still remembers Jasmine’s final words to her, which causes her to break into tears upon hearing Tsukune say them; he was willing to let the vampire blood in him take over if it meant saving the life of the ones he loved.\n\nAkua’s hurting of the person who Jasmine liked was most likely due to jealousy or envy, even possibly anger. It seems that Akua is simply the type of person who cannot share love, both emotionally and mentally. She seems to have a misunderstanding of love and has difficulty seeing the differences between loyalty and loving more than one person.\n\nDespite her difficulty with seeing love properly, she is good inside and truly does have a good heart. Her cry for love may or may not be the terms of  “desperation”, as she is simply desperate for love and attention, showing a sign of both an inferiority complex and insecurities. For these reasons, she is sad, and this cannot be helped, because it seems she does not want to help herself. While initially not a threat to Moka’s Rosario while okay with the rosary, Akua is particularly nonfond of Tsukune and sees him as a threat to her as Akua is particularly jealous that Tsukune makes Moka so happy, which Akua wants to be the reason for Moka’s happiness.\nHistory\n\nAkua Shuzen is the daughter of Issa Shuzen. Like Kahlua, she is also a member of Fairy Tale but was once a member and assassin of the Miao Family. Not much is known about her, but it is pointed out that Akua is not on good terms with Moka, as something happened between the two in the past.\n\nAkua’s mother died when she was young and she had lived with a relative in China before coming to live with the Shuzen Family. She is extremely skilled in Chinese kung-fu, as her “Youho Saishusui” (translated as “Hand Strike”) could knock a person out for at least three days. Akua has amazing insight in battle as she was able to see the truth behind Kahlua. She was known in the Chinese underground even as a child. She is called “The Jet Black Diva” because of her black attire and lethal kung-fu.\n\nBefore meeting the Shuzen Family, Akua lived in secret amongst humans, with a vampiress named Jasmine. After Jasmine was mutilated by humans, Akua swore on her remains that she’d exterminate humans. This was why she joined Alucard.\n\nIt was revealed Akua was after Akasha and wanted to absorb her “Shinso” power. Before attempting such a feat, she mastered the Hougetsu Jigen-Tou (also known as the “Moon Crushing Dimensional Sword”), a powerful blade that delays the existence of its wielder. It can cut through anything, and it seems that the only thing that can stop a Jigen-Tou, is another one to par with it and Muei-Tou.\n\nDuring their battle, it appears that Akua has the edge, though Akasha doesn’t seem to be fighting back and instead, is trying to get through to her. The two of them are then interrupted by Moka who has come back to retrieve the Rosario Cross. Demanding to know why Akua is hurting her mother and with Akasha distracted, Akua slices her in half. Witnessing her mother’s “death”, Moka unleashes her Shinso power and kicks a bewildered Akua.\n\nAkua is completely shocked at Moka displaying the Shinso power since it’s not supposed to be hereditary. Due to this, Alucard awakens due to the Shinso blood in Moka becoming active again and destroys the Shuzen manor. Akua tries to save Moka, whom Alucard immediately attacks to feast on her blood, but is saved by Akasha, whom to her surprise has survived.\n\nWatching as Akasha once again seals the beast, Akua remembers her last words to her as Akasha entrusts Moka to her protection.\nManga\n\nIn the present time, Akua is seen arriving at the Huang Family’s mansion searching for Moka. She engages in combat with Fang Fang’s parents, whom she defeats easily. She soon arrives at the room where Moka and the others are. Akua starts to tear, happy to see her sister after seven long years. Fang Fang attempts to attack Akua, and she retaliates, only to be stopped by Ling Ling. Surprised, Akua asks Ling Ling how she was able to stop her Jigen-Tou. Ling Ling smiles and claims she is a zombie created by Fuhai Touhou, and that she has inherited his technique. They do battle, where Akua’s greater speed and endurance win over Ling Ling’s tactics.\n\nEven rounds from an Uzi and a suicide bombing attempt from Ling Ling fails to harm Akua as she alters the Jigen-Tou technique to ‘phase out her body, allowing the bullets to go right through her and to phase into the ground to prevent injury from the blast. She strikes down Fang Fang before she realizes that Moka’s body has been moved. Fuhai reveals himself to her, having escaped from Moka’s rosary seal to save his grandchildren.\n\nConversing with Touhou Fuhai, Akua once again demands that Touhou Fuhai turn Moka over to her. When he asks her why she is so determined to get to Moka, she replies by saying it’s because she loves her, and wants to protect her with her own hands in order to fulfill her promise to Akasha. She asks Touhou Fuhai to hand Moka over so that they do not have to fight, but Fuhai, overcome with rage at what Akua did to his family, engages her in combat using his own Hogetsu Jigen-Tou which it is revealed he can use from long-range.\n\nAt this point, however, Akua decides to use Fei-Hong Huang and Ten-Ten Huang as hostages in order to force Fuhai to hand over Moka. She then realizes that Moka is actually hidden behind a barrier in the room behind Fuhai, and then uses her own Hogetsu Jigen Tou at range (which she uses after only witnessing it once) and breaks the barrier, revealing Moka behind it.\n\nAkua comments on how many friends Moka has made at school and asks her if she would not like to see her friends get hurt. Realizing there are too many hostages, Moka decides to leave with Akua in order to protect everyone. Welcoming her to Fairy Tale, Akua and Moka depart on a large blimp surrounded by gremlins, as Tsukune and the others look on.\n\nAkua and Moka are next seen on the blimp. The inside is large and lavished with elegant decorations and with a large number of servants standing at attention. When led to her room, Moka is surprised at its grandeur and pauses, making one of Akua's henchmen push her into the room to hurry her up. Akua becomes mad at seeing her older sister (the daughter of the respected Akasha Bloodriver) being treated with such disrespect and warns to decapitate the servant should he ever lay a hand on Moka again. Akua tells Moka to relax and change and then goes to her own quarters. Upon closing the door however, her icy demeanor changes and she talks to herself about how \"cute\" Moka is.\n\nHowever, her plans are suddenly and abruptly derailed when she returns to Moka’s room only to find that Inner Moka had switched personalities with Outer Moka. She asks why now only to find a note stuck to the rosary that was written by Touhou Fuhai. It reads “The seal has been fixed. Sorry~! – Touhou Fuhai” and upon reading it, she angrily exclaims his name.\n\nShe later takes Moka to Fairy Tale Headquarters, where she constantly asks Outer Moka questions to see if she differs from the Inner Moka. After trying to comfort Moka by telling her she is with her and she does not have to be alone, Akua is angered to learn that Outer Moka doesn’t consider herself alone as she has the News Club for friends. In return for this, she takes her to see Alucard and reminds her that Akasha is still sealing from the inside, causing Moka to cry.\n\nShe later informs Moka of the News Club to save her and informs Moka that if she tries to hold back Alucard’s awakening, she will be taken apart by the resulting seal release.\n\nWhen Kurumu and Mizore found Moka, they immediately engaged in battle with Akua. Even though they fought admirably, Akua defeated them while Moka’s seal broke, awakening Inner Moka. When Akua called Tsukune Moka's “tool”, she kicked her only to find out she is using her power to keep the seal intact. During Alucard's raucous, Akua and Moka both spotted Tsukune. As Akua went to kill him, she is surprised at Tsukune’s sudden burst of speed. As Moka cried to Tsukune’s resolve to protect her, Akua cried that Moka opened her heart to him instead of her.\n\nIn chapter 56, Akua begins to falter in her attacks against Tsukune and Moka. She then has a flashback, possibly to her childhood, where a possible friend of hers shouts that she’ll never forgive her. This completely distracts Akua, and Moka manages to land a brutal blow that probably was enough to break her neck.\n\nIn chapter 65, at the end of the manga chapter, Akua reappeared, cutting off Alucard's arm when he was about to attack Moka. That indicates that she managed to survive after taking the brutal blow from Moka in her previous fight and now she’s standing in Alucard's way to protect Moka. In chapter 65.5, Akua reveals that she made a deal with Alucard, to spare Moka's life in exchange for undoing her seal. The two begin to fight, and Alucard tells the story of “Akua and her best friend” Jasmine, who was mutilated and “skewered” by humans, noting that Moka and Jasmine look alike. He also reveals that he helped Akua because of her desire for revenge.\n\nAkua tells him to shut up and completely slashes him with the Jigen-Tou in a single instant - where the other characters were unable to touch him at all. Telling Moka that she will protect her from now on and telling her that there are things more important than revenge, Akua reaches for her older sister, but is stopped when Alucard's spines burst from the ground and pierce Moka and Tsukune who tried to protect her. As Alucard reassembles - being unable to die unless his “true” body is killed, Akua cries.\n\nMinutes later, she finds Tsukune comforting the seemingly lifeless Moka. She tells him the seal is completely gone, as is Outer Moka. Though she also proclaimed her life wasn’t completely lost and offered to revive her. After this proclamation, she bites Moka and started to inject her own blood, and while doing this, she began to remember her best friend Jasmine and the small discussion they had before the humans capture her and kill her.\n\nTsukune then intervenes and tells Akua that she’s giving too much blood and that she’ll die before saving Moka, Akua gets angry and pulls back Tsukune to reveal his underdeveloped fangs, she tells him that blood can only be injected through vampiress fangs and that his half-grown fangs are useless, and she goes on to say that he is weak and that his blood is unable to save Moka. Tsukune then tells her that he’ll become a vampire and remove the Holy Lock, which is suppressing his power, Akua warns Tsukune that by making that decision he will not only die but become just like one of Gyokuro’s experiments.\n\nTsukune attempts to proceed and is questioned by Akua who tells him that he is crazy and that a human wouldn’t go that far, Tsukune removes the Holy Lock without hesitation, stunning Akua, he replies that he doesn’t care about the differences between humans and monsters, nothing is more important to him than the woman he loves. When he says this Akua thinks of Jasmine from Tsukune’s kind words, he then proceeds to give Moka blood in order to revive her, she realizes that Tsukune's average feelings for Moka are real and is willing to give his life for Moka’s, in tears, Akua then calls out Tsukune’s full name as he proceeds to revive Moka with his blood.\n\nAfter Kurumu, Mizore and Kokoa arrive and find out they can’t reach Tsukune because of the power vortex, Akua shows herself and tells Kurumu and Mizore she has no wish to fight them. After Akua explained Tsukune’s dire predicament and seeing Kurumu’s distress, San Otonashi showed up letting them know Alucard was en route to kill Tsukune and Moka. Akua held out her hand and tells them she’s willing to help.\n\nAfter she created a spell circle that would allow them all to help Tsukune and Moka, Akua was asked why she would help. She said because she understood why they all risked their lives for Tsukune…as she had also fallen for him. After a moment in which everyone was floored by this, Kurumu said Akua couldn’t have him and Akua said/claimed that she was joking as she loved Moka alone. They pooled their power and feelings to help and save Tsukune and Moka. Before Alucard could attack, the vortex dissipated and revealed Tsukune and Moka as fully realized Shinso Vampires.\n\nWhen Alucard rose up refusing to die, Akua was seemly surprised that he is still alive. A few minutes later after Alucard reveals the true plan to rule over Japan along with his creatures that hatched out of the eggs he planted all over the cities and members of the Wong families, Miu families and Yōkai Academy appear battling his creature everywhere, Akua joins her sister’s friends and she along with everyone proceed to attack Alucard in the final battle.\n\nWhen Tsukune places the destroyed Rosario on Alucard’s chest which recreates Akasha’s revival, Akua is indeed surprised. As the Three Dark Lords and Alucard set up a self-destruction spell leaving their dream of humans and creatures living in peace to the next generation to set off on a new journey, Akua comes to Moka and Tsukune revealing that the Outer Moka they’ve known was Akasha to protect Moka as a personality and the promise she made was to set Moka free all for her sister's happiness.\n\nAkasha thanks Akua for keeping her promise for the past 7 years as Akua replied with a smile by saying, “you have…no idea the pain it caused me.” Akua watches as Akasha activates the self-destruction spell vanishing from the world.   \n\nIn chapter 67 Extra II Epilogue/Tales, Akua is playing chess with Kahlua (revived by Miyabi) and the two of them are to become future leaders of the Shuzen Family,it appears she and Kahlua decided to stop killing.\nRelationships\n\nKahlua Shuzen\n\nAkua has high confidence in Kahlua, knowing she kills when she angered. Kahlua is a high-powered vampiress, and Akua acknowledges that. The two are both the eldest of the Shuzen Sisters, Akua being the first, while Kahlua is the second.\n\nMoka Akashiya\n\nMoka Akashiya is Akua’s sister. Akua is infatuated with her because Moka looks like Jasmine. She did not want to kill Akasha, because it would sadden Moka. Akua is on good terms with both Inner and Outer Moka. To Akua, Moka is the most special person in the world.\n\nKokoa Shuzen\n\nAkua sees Kokoa as a rambunctious sister but loves Kokoa and takes care of her. Kokoa is not afraid of Akua like she is afraid of Kahlua and they were pretty close. However, as Akua was working with Fairy Tale, Kokoa considered her an enemy, although whether she intended to personally fight her like she did with Kahlua remained unknown. Whether Akua is aware of this remains unclear but her cold gaze when they finally met in person implies she knew and Kokoa was weary of her at first. However, they soon accepted they were going to fight together and worked well in battle, but they have not been seen interacting yet.\n\nIssa Shuzen\n\nIssa is Akua’s biological father, although Gyokuro is not biologically related to Akua. Issa took her in after she had nowhere to go. Issa sees Akua as a very powerful vampiress.\n\nGyokuro Shuzen\n\nGyokuro Shuzen is Akua Shuzen’s stepmother. She takes Akua in as by Alucard’s request. Gyokuro was powerful and strong before she died. Akua might see her as a mother figure.\n\nAlucard\n\nAlucard is Akua’s grandfather and the one who inspired Akua to kill all humans. Alucard is a strong and powerful vampire that killed other monsters to become more powerful and Akua intended to do the same thing by drinking Akasha shinso blood to become more powerful but besides her admiration for Alucard power it seems that Akua doesn't like Alucard or his clone miyabi as a person as she keeps has given him death gaze\n\nJasmine\n\nJasmine is a young vampiress who looks a lot like Moka and Akua’s stepsister who got upset when Akua killed the boy she liked.\n\nPowers and Abilities\n\nVampirism: Despite not having the Shinso blood, Akua has proven herself to be one of the most powerful vampires in the series with power nearly rivalling the Shinso bloodline in the same regard as her father, Issa Shuzen. This indicates that like him, Akua reached the pinnacle of vampiric potential and abilities with Alucard himself stating that she's already equal to that of the Three Dark Lords.\nImmense Speed and Reflexes: Akua has proven herself to be extremely fast even when she's not fighting seriously as shown when first introduced to the Shuzen family 7 years ago, she was able to swiftly overwhelm Kahlua with fast attacks that her younger sister was barely able to react to. During the Miao family's attack on the Huang family's estate under orders by Fairy Tale, Akua quickly defeated Huang Ten-Ten and Huang Fei-Hong's combination before they could react while her subordinates were easily defeated. When fighting Tsukune and Moka together, even while holding back, Akua was able to easily fight both of them at the same time while effortlessly blocking and dodging their attacks simultaneously even when Tsukune increased his speed with his First Seal Unlock. Upon confronting Miyabi Fujisaki who revealed himself to be Alucard, she was able to move above supersonic speed when she appeared in front of Miyabi Fujisaki and sliced off his right hand before the Shinso clone could react as well as slicing him to several pieces in an instant when enraged by his words despite Miyabi's attention facing Akua and the small distance apart between the two which left Tsukune completely stunned at how fast she dealt with him. \nEnhanced Agility: Akua is also very agile being able to land a few attacks on Akasha Bloodriver during their fight and even jump several feet into the air to launch her Hyakujin Ryouran upon the Shinso vampire. Later on, during the start of her fight with Tsukune Aono and Moka Akashiya, Akua proceeded to travel across the battlefield right to where Tsukune was with one powerful leap and attempted to bisect him with a Jigen-Tou. \nEnhanced Durability: The tissues of her body are considerably harder and more resistant to physical injury than those of an ordinary human. She is capable of withstanding great impact forces, and many other forms of damage as shown when she fought against Mizore Shirayuki and Kurumu Kurono where she was able to defeat two of them with ease grievously wounding them while remaining completely unharmed throughout the battle. When Akua had falter during her fight with Tsukune and Moka thus allowing Moka to land a powerful kick to her face that sent Akua flying through a boulder, Moka remarked that the strike was about enough to break Akua's neck due to her not having high endurance. Though she reappeared to save Moka from Miyabi Fujisaki after he revealed himself as the Masked King and Alucard completely unharmed after having an extended amount of time to recover and without any strain in her performance. \nEnhanced Stamina: Akua's musculature produces considerably less fatigue toxins than the musculature of ordinary humans or ordinary monsters allowing to be physically active for longer periods of time. 7 ago after Moka Akashiya's awakening of her Shinso blood, Akua aided Akasha Bloodriver in rescuing Moka just after doing battle against the Dark Lord and suffering a great injury from Moka's enraged kick. She was able to fight effectively against multiple opponents for a considerable amount of time in rapid succession as Akua was able to fight on even grounds against Moka and Tsukune Aono just after defeating Kurumu Kurono and Mizore Shirayuki simultaneously.  \nRegenerative Healing Factor: As a vampire, Akua has high healing abilities being able to recover from deadly injuries quickly as shown when she took two powerful kicks from Inner Moka one which caused bleeding to her forehead and another which send her crashing into a boulder and later reappeared to confront Miyabi (aka Alucard) completely unharmed.\nYōki Detection: Like other vampires, Akua can detect Yōki. This technique allows the user to detect the energies of the beings around him/her, letting the user react faster when is attacked.\nGreat Demonic Aura: Despite only being considered as a mere S-Class vampire, Akua Shuzen’s Yōki is powerful enough to rival against the likes of Alucard - the strongest Shinso vampire as shown when Miyabi released his Yōki which brought everyone down to their knees, Akua shown the only one standing mostly unfazed as she was only slightly shaken when he released his Yoki.\nBlood Transfusion: As a vampiress, Akua is able to use this in order to revive Moka, however, the more blood she transfers her body will become cold and she'll be on the verge of death. By doing this, she was willing to give Moka more of her blood, even if it cost her own being to do so.\nAbilities\n\nMaster Hand-to-Hand Combatant: Akua is an exceptional fighter and is highly masterful in Kung Fu with Miyabi commented that she rivals the Three Dark Lords in terms of battle skill. As demonstrated when she was fighting against Kahlua in the Shuzen Mansion where she easily overwhelmed her younger sister. Akua managed to pressure Akasha Bloodriver when the Shinso could not use her full powers at the risk of Alucard's awakening. Touhou Fuhai has remarked that she is a true genius and had already surpassed him hand-to-hand combat and that Tsukune could never defeat someone like her. After easily defeating both Kurumu and Mizore simultaneously, Kurumu lamented that even if they had trained for 1,000 years they still could not hope to defeat Akua. Before fighting against Tsukune and Moka, Ruby upon seeing her for the first time identified Akua as Fairy Tale's strongest fighter while expressing surprise at her tender emotions then. When she was fighting equally against both Tsukune and Moka in the Floating Garden Fortress holding her own against their teamwork, Gyokuro pointed out that Akua wasn't even fighting seriously due to her love for Moka (albeit Tsukune Aono was also holding back as well). During that fight Tsukune had noted that if Moka wasn't helping him at the time then he would had have been killed by Akua several times over and that they were only able to temporarily defeat Akua because she had started faltering from remembering Jasmine.\nMaster Assassin: Akua is well renowned within the Chinese Yokai Mafia as a fearsome assassin known as the \"Black Devil\" when she was still working for the Miao Family with her title coming from her incredibly lethal Kung Fu and black colored attire.\nYoujutsu Master: Akua is very skillful at Youjutsu with the Hougetsu Jigen-Tou being her specialty like Touhou Fuhai and the Dark Lord remarking that she had mastered the technique to the point of it being her own. Indeed, her proficiency rivals that of Touhou Fuhai himself, the technique's creator, being able to launch at a distance like him. In fact, she even created her own personal technique that extends from the original Jigen-Tou in preparation to fight against Akasha Bloodriver. Akasha had even referred to Akua as a sinister child when she had proficiently learned the Jigen-Tou as such a young age when the two had fought 7 years ago.\nEvasion Expert: Akua can evade deadly projectiles or punches made at her because she knows how to use dimension techniques that allows her to slide physical objects using the dimensions. Ling Ling attempted to kill Akua with a suicide explosion, but Akua hid underground and survived. Another example of this is when Tim-Tim Huang threw needles at Akua and Akua evades them by making her body a Jigen-Tou. Also, Akua has general experience in fights which helps her evade attacks.\nKeen Intellect: Akua is very perceptive, and she can easily read the opponent's movements. Her experience fighting as a child is one of the reasons why she is so adept in combat. Akua is capable of understanding how an ability or a technique works almost instantly. This is seen when she is fighting Tsukune (who has decent fighting skills) and compares his moves to a wild beast who only knows how to charge. The same can be said when she had fought Kahlua and she could see through her younger sister's rage something that Moka made careful note about and wondered how much of her potential was Akua hiding from the Shuzen Family at the time. She is arguably the most intelligent out of the four sisters of the Shuzen.\nExpert Researcher: Akua seems to also research about weaknesses and/or missing components to fulfill her goal to become a Shinso and rule the world. Interestingly enough she researched the Jigen-Tou and worked it as her own technique. Later Touhou Fuhai claims that there is a 40 second pause in which Akua cannot phase after using the Jigen-Tou but it can be assumed that he was saying that based on his own use of the technique and not a general law of the Jigen-Tou as Akua was not affected by it. It is implied that Akua can use the technique even better than Touhou Fuhai can.\nTechniques\n\nMartial Arts Techniques:\n\nElbow Strikes: Akua seems to specialize in elbow strikes in Chinese Kung-Fu as shown when she fights Kahlua. She uses them as a maneuver to block Kahlua's attacks (and strike at the same time) then use Youho Saishusui on Kahlua.\nYouho Saishusui (Twist Step, Plucking Hand Strike): A powerful Kung-Fu technique where after setting up a trap, Akua pushes her opponent's attack upwards with her right hand while delivering a devastating left-hand punch that can incapacitate a person for three days.\nYoujutsu Techniques:\n\nHougetsu Jigen-Tou (Moon Crushing Dimensional Sword): Akua possess remarkable profiency with Jigen - Tou, having been able to equal Touhou Fuhai's own Jigen - Tou and can even attack from a distance with this attack as well. As a dimensional blade technique, it can't be blocked unless the dimension it is going through is blocked.  Jigen-Tou can break through barriers because of this property it has to slice through anything. Akua also uses the principles of Jigen-Tou to become intangible.\nHyakujin Ryouran (Profusion of One Hundred Blades): a more powerful version of the common version of Jigentou Akua uses. It is literally one hundred blades slicing through anything in its way.\nSeal Breaking: Can break seals but it takes time to set up unlike her other techniques.\nTransference Magic Circle: A technique that create a magic circle allowing those on the circle's edge to forcibly intervene with those at the circle's center. She along with Tsukune's friends used this in order to save Tsukune by not turning him back to a human but giving him the final push to become a vampire so he can have full control over his Shinso powers. That is by transferring their knowledge, experience, and skills to Tsukune.  "

She arrives as a first-year student to Yōkai Academy. Like her sister, Kokoa is also a Vampire, but her powers are not sealed. Being younger, Kokoa is not as strong as the 'sealed' Inner Moka, but uses a Transformer Bat, named Kou (also named Koumori Nazo and Kou-Buddy (Kou-buddy being the English dub version of \"Kō-chan\")) to make herself more formidable.\n\n\nPersonality\n\nKokoa can be energetic and kind if she gets to know someone. She worships inner Moka but loathes the sweet outer personality (though she seems to grow tolerant if not accepting of her later). Despite how many times she's been told something, Kokoa never listens to elders. However, there is a mutual respect between herself and Yukari. Though a bit angry and jealous of Tsukune (for being given all Moka's attention), Kokoa grows to like him in the back of her mind. Also noted, she is smug, thinking vampiresses are prettier than all other monsters. Examples of this include her reasonable annoyance of Akua and Kahlua and not to mention her comical annoyance of Ms. Nekonome. But she can also be brave and determined as such when she was little and refused to give up on besting Moka in martial arts. She displays a strong inferiority complex towards her sisters due to their status as geniuses and strives to be recognized by them due to this. After training and fighting with Haiji, she managed to overcome her fear of Kahlua and effectively shocked her mother by overpowering her, showing that her inferiority complex had some strong effect on her overall performance in battle.\n\nKokoa has been portrayed with nosebleeds towards the perverted antics of her club mates, such as when Kurumu flaunts her chest in front of Tsukune or places his head between them. It is implied from these nosebleeds that she is dirtier minded than she would have others believe (as she hates being touched in any way by Tsukune and constantly accuses him of groping her, for which she consequently kicks him far away.) Stemming from her pride, she appears to rate others on their grace, as she only warmed up to the newspaper club after seeing them fight. Keeping with this she later stated that Kahlua's graceful appearance was such that she could completely fall for her, however one has to consider that this was merely a verbal expression of her respect towards her.\n\nUnlike the other women around Tsukune, she has not displayed much in the way of romantic affection towards him, she has however been shown to be clearly attracted to the smell and taste of his blood. Her affection for Moka often sees her attempting to drive a wedge between Tsukune and her sister, implying that even if she does hold some attraction towards him, it is most likely dwarfed by her obsession towards Moka.\n\nTen months after Alucard's demise, Kokoa seems to have emotionally leveled from Kahlua's final words. She seems calmer (not so eager for a fight), and has an easier time interacting with her clubmates.\nAppearance\n\nWith a few similarities to her half older sister, Moka Akashiya, Kokoa has green eyes, red hair, and fair skin. She keeps her hair tied in two bushy ponytails with big red bows. Kokoa's outfit is a typical Japanese \"sailor suit\" or \"sailor girl\", and/or \"sailor fuku\" based outfit in appearance to what some girls may wear in Japan in other schools, properly most notably human girls in human schools.\n\nShe wears a white shirt and a red sailor girl top, with buttons and a tie split in two. She wears a short yellow-green skirt like all the female students, and long red-brown stockings with a white stripe at the top. This entire outfit acts as a sailor-fuku in appearance, due to its necktie, which gives the appearance as being split in two, and the white, collar-like lapel parts that do not actually go to the neck like a collar. Either that, or it is just open-collared. She wears brown prom heels with bows and has a little bracelet on the left wrist in appearance, which in appearance, seems to be a \"uniform bracelet\" as its sailor-fuku plaid schoolgirl color deeply resembles that of her shirt or schoolgirl top.\n\nWhen she was temporarily aged up by Gro-Gro drops, Kokoa grew to 5’4” (just an inch shorter than Moka) but possessed the same body measurements.\nHistory\n\nKokoa was the second child of the Shuzen household, born to Issa and Gyokuro Shuzen. Her mother had her in hopes of bringing Issa’s attention back to her from his second wife, Akasha, but to no avail. Causing her mother to resent her from that day forward.\n\nShe idolized her sister Moka, seeing her as a powerful and beautiful vampiress. Though she and Kahlua loved each other she was afraid of her sisters mental instability and never wanted to play with her.\n\nShe would always try to play with Moka, by challenging her to a fight. To make up for the gap in strength, Kokoa would always use weapons while Moka fought barehanded. But Moka still beat her every time due to her older sisters superior speed and skill.\n\nWhen Moka was almost ten, their father introduced them to Akua and watched as she and Kahlua fought each other to a draw.\n\nMoka found Kokoa crying in a corner (not the first time) about being treated as a kid by their family. Moka responded by kicking Kokoa down and telling her to train, saying that she won’t get any respect unless she toughens up. Enraged Kokoa attempted to fight Moka with a big hammer, and lost. After the fight Moka tells Kokoa that she doesn’t hold any punches when fighting her because then that wouldn’t be real training. Kokoa then asks Moka why she’s the only one who doesn’t treat her like a baby. Moka said that it’s because she is a kid too.\n\nOne time in the winter their parents went out to a party while leaving Moka in charge of her and their sisters. Kokoa stole Moka from Akua by challenging her to a fight.\n\non Moka’s eleventh birthday she caught a her Transformer Bat, Koumori Nazo to give to Moka as a present, but Moka gave it back to her (saying that the heavy weapon was better suited for Kokoa and adding that the bat was already fond of her) to Kokoa’s sadness. Shortly after she challenged Moka to a fight, this time with Kou, but still lost. After Moka proclaimed to Kokoa that she would never beat her, Kokoa swore that she would someday and never stop trying. However, she became enraged when Moka revealed that she was being sent to live in the human world and that her powers would be sealed away by a rosary. Kokoa did not accept this and chases after the car Moka was being driven away in, to no avail.\n\nShe eventually found her sister again, now sealed away by the rosary and with “Outer Moka” in control (a pink haired, weaker, alter ego created by Akasha with the rosary). Determined to get her “real” sister back, Kokoa continuously tried to attack Outer Moka, thinking that it would get her to unleash Inner Moka in self defense but Moka always ran away. She continued to find Moka whenever she moved until Moka finally lost her by enrolling in Yokai Accademy.\nManga\n\nRosario + Vampire II\n\nSeveral years later, Kokoa appears as a fresh face around Yōkai Academy, even impressing Tsukune Aono with her looks. Kokoa originally transferred to Yōkai, finding Tsukune Aono with a problem with the headmaster Tenmei Mikogami's pet porcupine rodent Spiky \"nibbling\" his head, and smacks the porcupine Spiky off his head. By Kokoa's infatuation with Tsukune's blood, he suspects she's a vampiress, but this Vampiress does not suck blood, but rather licks Tsukune's forehead when it bleeds after actually hitting him with her suitcase. At the beginning, Kokoa is just walking around trying to destroy Moka, particularly Outer Moka, as Kokoa prefers Inner and believes Inner Moka to be more of her real sister. She refers to Outer Moka's soothing, trying-to-calm-Kokoa attitude as \"a mother hen\". Kokoa genuinely loves inner Moka and wants outer Moka out of the picture for good. She dares Moka to fight her, hoping by getting Outer Moka to fight her, the inner Personality will come out. Kurumu and the rest just see her more as a pest than a threat and want to get rid of her big time.\n\nLater on, Kokoa comes across a dark fellow who disguises himself. Kokoa is unable to fight the Doppelganger, being too weak at the Doppelganger's martial art powers and power he gains from transforming into others. The Doppelganger transforms into Inner Moka through sucking the power from Outer Moka, and becomes very scary. Kokoa is weak toward the Phantom Thief and the Unnamed Doppelganger is too powerful with Moka's powers until Tsukune takes off Moka's rosary and plants the Rosario onto the Doppelganger's hand, weakening his powers and rendering him powerless. Later on, the Newspaper Club wants to get new members and try to get them by dressing in some form of cheerleader outfits, and even against her own will, putting Kokoa in a cheerleading \"Newspaper Club\" outfit. The outfits work as uniforms and get a lot of joining members, but Kokoa is ashamed of the embarrassing-like style of the doing and says the latter is not for vampires and no vampiress would willingly dress like that, until outer Moka comes out, and Yukari Sendo says some Vampiress would. Kokoa goes on her own with her pet Bat, Kou, and tries to look for a club to join, except all of the clubs want very strong-looking male fighters, and Kokoa is out of luck, until Yukari finds her and lets her eat Gro-Gro Drops to look like a proud, young, but older, beautiful woman, with height, and she gets into shows off to the Karate Club, but when she tells the club that they are too puny for her, they want to fight her, but she wins. Kokoa is happy with her new large chest and large attitude, with tall height, but soon it wears off and the Gro-Gro Drops show their side-effect, to which Kokoa is in desperate need of clothes that fit her and fit the size she has become now. Kokoa goes over to Moka and her group with Tsukune, to that latter which, does not work out so well as Kurumu finds her too adorable and now wants to have children with Tsukune. Kokoa gets upset, and the gang tries to find new outfits for her to wear, but she ends up in a mock maid's uniform outfit, and stays in it. Kokoa then goes with the Newspaper Club, and they spend time with her. When the others drink coffee, and Moka gives her a cream soda, she gets upset that she doesn't get to drink coffee with the rest of the club, but when Moka offers to trade, Kokoa wants the cream soda back.\n\nAll is not lost when Kokoa walks out on her own and people want to fight her for beating the Karate Club earlier. Kokoa is scared and afraid, and feels she cannot fight, but Haiji Miyamoto wants to hold her and fondle her because she is so cute now, but the Newspaper club gang comes in little kiddie form and defeat the entire Karate Club with Kokoa fighting as one. Kokoa then knows she is accepted, and joins the Newspaper Club when everyone bails out at the end of the second book. By the third book, Kokoa is a member of the Newspaper Club and still getting used to being a new student at Yōkai Academy. She meets Ginei Morioka, a werewolf with a wolf's-head pendent on his necklace to show his pride and loyalty toward being a werewolf. Kokoa discovers that mysteriously girls are having ripped clothing what appears out to be out of nowhere, and finds a thought in Ginei being the culprit behind it, to which Kurumu and Mizore Shirayuki help her, but Gin trashes both Kurumu and Mizore, and tells Kokoa that she saw nothing. Gin Morioka seems to get away with things, until a girl named Kokko Nakamoto gets involved and intervenes, with initially liking Gin for telling her that she looks cute without her eyeglasses on, and so she mostly goes without her glasses on. It turns out, Ginei was the one behind it all and he had a list of \"girlfriends\" he kept on track to call whenever he wanted. Kokoa is, of course, like the rest, disgusted with this, and the girls of the Newspaper Club all beat up on him. Then, when summer comes, Mizore offers for a trip to her snow village, to which the Snow Village is icy cold and covered in ice and snow. Kokoa dresses in a proper Japanese traditional kimono, and goes out to the trip, where they all meet Kahlua Shuzen. Kahlua beats up a lot of the members of the club, but they all survive and Inner Moka has her Rosario released and won't leave without a fight. Kahlua praises Moka for taking off her rosary, even though it was actually Tsukune. Kahlua retreats with Miyabi Fujisaki later on, and leaves, with Miyabi saying it will not be the last time, and fly up in the helicopter jet plane. Kokoa with the rest of the group, saves the priestess of the snow village, and rescues Mizore from a terrible marriage. The adventures then move on.\n\nYear Two\n\nPhantom Thieves Arc\n\nKokoa first appears when Tsukune is having his head \"nibbled\" on by the headmaster's pet Spiky. Telling Tsukune to hold still, she uses her schoolbag and knocks Spiky off. After some banter she then notes that Tsukune's blood smells delicious and licks it causing him to freak out. She then leaves for the Welcome Ceremony waving goodbye to Tsukune.\n\nKokoa appears next in Moka's classroom, having already met Kurumu, Yukari, and Mizore. She recognized Moka and also recognized the person next to her as \"That delicious person from this morning\" then tried to walk towards him while saying \"How unexpected to see you here\" and \"What kind of destiny is this--\" but was interrupted by Moka. She then proceeds to attack Moka. During the barrage of attacks she hurts Tsukune (trying to make outer Moka transform into inner Moka) causing him to bleed. She tries lick his blood again, causing Kurumu to hit her with a desk. Kokoa and Kurumu were about engage in a fight but Outer Moka stops them saying Kokoa is her sister. Kokoa leaves saying next time she'll force Outer Moka to transform.\n\nLater, Kokoa is expressing happiness that Outer Moka agreed to fight her. After winning the fight Kokoa cries asking why Outer Moka won't fight for real. She expresses her grief of not being able to fight her for years. Tsukune appears and tells her that she's only been following Outer Moka for attention, but tells them that's not it and smashes her iron mace on Outer Moka and Tsukune saying she hates Moka. Inner Moka lifts the mace and kicks Kokoa. She get's up exerting her vampiress aura seemingly about to attack, but instead hugs her saying she missed her real sister. The next day, Kokoa is shown chasing and attacking Outer Moka so she can transform again.\n\nSome time later, Kokoa is watching Outer Moka, Kurumu, and Mizore fighting over Tsukune. She shows disgust and wonders how her sister became like that. Kokoa comes to the conclusion that Moka's friends are what has changed her, so she tries to get Outer Moka away from them. She then helps the Newspaper Club find the probable hiding place of the thieves and suggest that she and Outer Moka can take care of the Street Slasher.\n\nKokoa expresses relief to separate Outer Moka from her friends. Kokoa and Outer Moka enter the school dungeon and Kokoa gives her Sister her bat Kou buddy, in the shape of a spiked club, to attack the person behind them, thinking it's the phantom. When they find out it's Tsukune following them, she's angry at him for messing up her plan. Tsukune then protects her from the Minotaur, but then gets hurt himself. Then Tsuchigumo appears and kidnaps Moka and Tsukune. Suddenly, Kurumu and Mizore appears and defeat the Minotaur, earning Kokoa's respect (but the respect was lost when she viewed them fight over who's fault it was for letting Moka and Tsukune get kidnapped).\n\nShe, Kurumu and Mizore ventured underground to find Tsukune and Moka after being abducted by monster criminals as they run into a doppelganger that looks like Tsukune. He has a fear of girls as the group confuses him for the real Tsukune and eventually, accidentally gropes Kokoa and slams the fake with a mace from her familiar. She sees the blood running from the criminal, tastes it then says it tastes like cigarettes.\n\nNew and Old Club Members Arc\n\nThis article is a stub. You can help Rosario + Vampire Wiki by expanding it.\nThe Land of the Snow Fairies Arc\n\nKoka was invited to join Mizore on a trip to her home land for a special moment since Mizore had turned to the age of marriage. She along with Moka and Ruby caused trouble to get Mizore, after being told she was to be in an arranged marriage with a man that would save their village from blood shed, Miyabi Fujisaki. She and the others ran into her and Moka's sister, Kahlua, the family assassin. Kokoa explains Kahlua's abilities and what she's like as Kahlua explains she works for Fairy Tale. She even explained that when Kahlua gets angry, they meant she was about to fight seriously. After the fighting was over, she and the others went back to Yokai Academy after Mizore decided to stay with her friends.\n\nSome time after, Tsukune went missing as they guessed he went training. Kokoa offers to help train them, but they just ignore what she said as Kokoa gets mad. Later it was revealed to the group Tsukune and Ruby were in a realm for endangered monsters for training and venture there to rescue Tsukune. However, he was doing fine as eventually she wanted to train with Tsukune in preparations for what happens next.\n\nSecond Battle with Fairy Tale Arc\n\nThis article is a stub.

You can help Rosario + Vampire Wiki by expanding it.\nEquipment\n\nShapeshifting Bat: Kokoa relies mostly on weaponry than hand-to-hand combat. Kokoa's weapon of choice is a 100kg shapeshifting bat named Kou. This bat can take many forms, usually weapons like:\nSword: Kokoa can transform the bat into a broad cleaver-like sword. She uses this mode to break one of Kahlua's wings while Kahlua was using wealth of power.\nBrass Knuckles: Kokoa had Kou take this form only once. After taking Gro-drops to take “adult” form and increasing her strength, Kokoa had Kou morph into a pair of blades knuckles to wrap around her forearm. Kokoa was able to use him to break through 13 reinforced tombstones in her enhanced form.\nRapier: In this form, the bat assumes a rapier-type form in order to counter swifter opponents.\nKatana: Kokoa shows Moka that she can transform the bat into a Katana when trying to convince Moka that the transforming bat was a good present.\nAxe: Axe Mode she used against Moka in a short quarrel in Moka's memory arc.\nMace: This is the most common form that Kokoa uses and probably the most powerful known mode next to Kokoa's sword mode.\nNaginata: Kokoa transforms Kou into a Japanese bladed spear in preparation to fight against Kahlua when she returned to the Yuki-Onna Village to warn Kokoa and Ruby of Akua's return.\nMorning Star: After transforming her bat into its Iron Mace form, she swings it at a target. The true power of this technique hasn't been shown, but Kokoa claimed that, if Outer-Moka didn't take her seriously, she would die.\nPowers and Abilities\n\nVampirism: As a vampire Kokoa is one of the toughest Yōkai there is possessing more powers and finesse in her monster abilities with Inner Moka remarking that Kokoa will be tougher to fight in comparison to most monsters that the Newspaper Club fought before. Despite this though it has been stated many times that due to her being the second sister in the Shuzen Family and with her immaturity, Kokoa's powers aren't as developed or great as the other members of her family particularly being no match for her sisters and parents and step mother. After training for months, Kokoa's strength and skill had developed to the point that she could break Kahlua's wings in her first release state with Kou, eventually defeating her. Impressing her sister greatly, and forcing her to unleash her full powers to defeat Kokoa. Kahlua noted that Kokoa’s attacks were getting stronger with each hit and believed that in ten years she might surpass her. Thought before that she was nearly killed by Khalua and needed to be saved by Haijin, twice.\nYōki Detection: Like every other vampires she can sense other people's Yōki.\nCharm: Though not in the same league as a Succubus, Kokoa can use the Charm ability. The ability itself is used to distract others so she can bite them rather than controlling them completely.\nEnhanced Strength: Like all vampires Kokoa possesses monstrous strength, however due to her age and small size she is less strong than her older sisters. However, she seems to be exceptionally strong for a vampire her size as, when Moka was ten she commented that Kokoa possessed super-strength even at a young age, being able to easily life Kou (who weighs 100kg) when even Akua commented he felt heavy. She is known as a vampiress who exerts strength through form and she is extremely strong for one who does. Her attacks are provided with extra force through the use of her 100 kg transformer bat. When she fought Kahlua to help save Moka in chapter 57, when determined and after 3 months of training to improve her form, Kokoa was able to use her bat in sword form to cut through her sister's razor sharp bat-wing arms, and is the only character thus far who's been able to do so. Her physical strength also proved strong enough to hold off one of Kahlua's blades with her leg. She was shown easily breaking reinforced tombstones. When her body and physique was enlarged to a more \"adult\" size by Gro-Gro drops she was strong enough to break thirteen reinforced tomb-stones at once (while using Kou as a pair of brass knuckles), which was considered a record among the competitors, though this was a temporary situation.\nEnhanced Speed, Reflexes, Agility: Kokoa has superior speed and agility to most monsters. She was able to fight off the entire Newspaper club (bar Inner Moka) and once rode her bike all the way from Yokai Accademy to Tsukune’s house in one day (anime only). Though she is far slower than her sisters, noticeably Moka and Khalua who have easily beaten her due to this. After training for three months her speed improved as to where she was able to nearly match Khalua’s, but still recieved cuts and was nearly killed by her sister twice.\nEnhanced Durability: Kokoa can take hits and kicks from Kahlua and Moka and wave them off. It is not known where her limits of endurance lay, but out of the four sisters it is most likely that she possesses the one of, if not, the highest overall, ignoring Kahlua's Charm, since that technique merely allows a person to \"ignore\" injuries. Like Moka and unlike Khalua, Kokoa also displayed the ability to tolerate the painful effects of water. This was shown in her final clash with Kahlua where Kokoa was able to force herself through pouring “raindrops” while Khalua was completely immobilized, allowing her to strike the final blow with enough force to mortally wound Kahlua.\nEnhanced Stamina: As a vampire , Kokoa possesses more stamina and produces less fatigue toxins than humans or ordinary monsters being able to fight for extended periods of time with little strain in her performance. Originally she didn't display any noteworthy feats of endurance at the beginning but after training with Haiji for a month Kokoa was able to last much longer against her older sister, Kahlua, than when the Newspaper Club first fought her at the Yuki-Onna village even well into the morning with Kokoa defeating Kahula's first released state after discovering the one advantage she had over her. Though she did need to spend the first half of the fight being saved by/fighting with Haijin.\nAbilities\n\nExpert Weapons Specialist: Despite having great power as a vampire, Kokoa usually wields her shapeshifting bat in his various weapon forms in combat to make up the gap in strength between her and her sisters. She mainly has him transform into enormous blunt weapons to pulverize most of her opponents thus showing that she relies on her strength more than the finesse of weaponry she has at her disposal. Though after training with Haiji Miyamoto for a month, Kokoa shows much better expertise in weaponry where she was able to fight on equal grounds against Kahlua's first release state (using Kou to block and counter Kahlua’s wings) and eventually defeated her sister that forced her to release her second limiter to defeat Kokoa . During this fight, Kahlua actually stated that her previous roughness had faded away and her form had lost all of its openings thus making it hard to retaliate. Combining her strength and skill together, Kahlua noted that Kokoa had truly become one who \"exerts their strength from performance\"."

However, in the manga, they seem to have no grudges between one another and appear to be on friendlier terms as Ageha helped Tsurara keep the zombies from cheating in the school race.\n\nIn the Omake segment of Rosario + Vampire Lesson Nine: Monster Mamas, the only actual \"skirmish\" between Ageha and Tsurara was when they bickered about whose daughter would win Tsukune. Misunderstanding Tsukune talking about goldfish he'd gotten in the scoop game, Tsurara asked Mizore Shirayuki how many women Tsukune had, to which Mizore said 'about six..I think.' Prompting Ageha to blush and say \"A week's worth of daily specials!\"\n\nDespite knowing that her daughter loves and wants to marry Tsukune, she has tried to ensnare the boy for herself a few times.\n\nAppearance\n\nAgeha is a beautiful and busty woman in her early/mid-thirties who has the same appearance as Kurumu Kurono as they both light blue hair and purple eyes. However, there are a few differences between Kurumu and Ageha:\n\nWhile Kurumu has shoulder-length straight hair that has bangs falling over her eyebrows and a lighter color, Ageha has wavy mid-back length or waist-length hair that has a darkish color tint in her hair with bangs swept to the left side.\nWhile Kurumu has G-cup breasts, Ageha has larger J-cup breasts.\nHer usual outfit is a red minidress that barely covers her ample cleavage (in the manga, her mini dress was shown to have spaghetti straps, but they are omitted in the anime. Specifically in the anime, much of her appearance is the same) and a brown fur coat. She also has long, red-nail-polish-coated claws, is of decent height for her age, wears a bright red strapless dress that is also specifically a mini-dress in length, with black hem in the anime, and her coat is black that sparkles and shines, and has light tan fur on the collar. Ageha also sports a pair of gold heart-shaped earrings and a matching heart necklace. In her true form as a Succubus, she has long sharp claws, bat wings and a succubus tail.\n\nDuring her days at Yōkai Academy, she had her hair tied in a ponytail while her bangs and she wore a plain, white long-sleeved shirt, the green pleated skirt all female students wear, white socks and brown shoes like Kurumu.\n\nAgeha as a student\nAgeha as a student\nFull body view of Ageha back when she was a student\nFull body view of Ageha back when she was a student\nPersonality\n\nUnlike Kurumu Kurono (Ageha's daughter) who learned to restrain her seductive nature, Ageha fully embraces her succubus instincts who even thinks Kurumu should already have \"experience\" intercourse at her age where she causes unending embarrassment for Kurumu because of how she acts towards Tsukune Aono, such as trying to give him \"pointers\". Despite this, she still cares for her daughter and ultimately wants to see her with the man of her dreams.\nManga\n\nYear Two\n\nIn the school festival, Ageha is introduced to Tsukune Aono by Kurumu Kurono (Ageha's daughter) who believed that both her daughter and Tsukune were together.

Some notable origins has Hanako-San being the ghost of a girl who was murdered while playing hide-and-seek during a World War II air raid, a victim of a plane crash, the lingering soul after a successful suicide or a victim of Atomic bomb of Hiroshima or Nagasaki. Regardless of origin, the story mostly agree that she died in the third stall of the third bathroom, and her specter now resides in there. To summon Hanako-San, the person summoning her must walk into a girl's bathroom, knock thrice, and asks if she is there. Depending on the version, the summoner might find themselves being dragged off to Hell (either by an ethereal hand or Hanako-San herself) or become the latest meal for a three-headed lizard.\nits a Vengeful Ghost be careful\nAppearance: Toire no Hanako-san is an urban legend about a young girl’s in her twenties and ghost who haunts elementary school restrooms. She is the subject of schoolyard legends across Japan, and the details of her story vary from place to place and generation to generation.

It covers every aspect of the craft — from the physical creation of circles, their formulaic structure, and methods of activation, to the painful and dangerous consequences of misuse. Circles are ranked by difficulty layers, with higher layers requiring extreme skill, vast mana reserves, and precision.\n\nThe entries also explore species-specific casting effects, taboo techniques such as mana reserve theft, collaborative casting through mana sharing, and the difference in outcomes when circles are used by mages of varying skill. The system emphasizes formula comprehension over rote memorization, rewarding analytical minds and encouraging innovation, such as the unorthodox concept of body-inscribed circles.\n\nThis magic system is designed for a rich, immersive world, allowing for complex spell customization, political intrigue around forbidden arts, and dramatic consequences for those who push the limits of their magical capacity.\n\nWARNING:\nIt has some bias for anthro characters, included definitions if a character is not human.

They are drawn physically (chalk, ink, blood, metal inlay) or conjured directly from mana, with physical forms being slower but more stable and conjured forms requiring great skill. \n\nThe circle’s structure usually has an outer boundary for containment, inner rings of runes or glyphs to define spell parameters, and power nodes where mana gathers before release. More complex designs allow layered effects, delayed triggers, or massive area spells, while simpler circles are quick to cast but weaker. \n\nA circle’s symmetry and detail affect efficiency, and different cultures use distinct artistic styles—religious symbols, geometric precision, or flowing organic patterns. Incorrect symbols or misaligned lines can corrupt or destabilize the spell, and overloading a fragile circle can cause it to shatter violently.\n\nCircle power is also classified by Layers — see Magic Circle Difficulty Layers.\n\nVariants include floating circles that hover behind the caster, multi-layered arrays for compound magic, and rare self-sustaining circles that persist without constant focus.\n"

          "content": "All magic in the known world is expressed through the framework of magic circles, each drawing on one or more of fourteen primary branches of magical force. These branches represent the fundamental “languages” of mana, shaping the formulas and rune patterns that determine a circle’s effect.\n\nThe fourteen branches are:\n\nReality – alters the underlying rules of existence.  \nGravity – manipulates weight, pull, and movement vectors.  \nTime – distorts temporal flow and perception.  \nEnchantment – binds lasting magical effects into objects.  \nConjuration – summons beings, objects, or phenomena.  \nNecromancy – channels death-aspected mana to influence the dead.  \nElemental – commands natural and elemental forces.  \nVitality – strengthens or restores life energy.  \nSound – shapes resonance, vibration, and silence.  \nTransmutation – restructures the nature of matter.  \nWeaponry – creates, empowers, or commands weapons.  \nBody – modifies the structure and function of living flesh.  \nSoul – affects the spiritual essence of beings.  \nRaw Magic – unshaped, primal force without alignment.\n\nAnyone with the knowledge and precision to reproduce a circle’s rune structure can, in theory, activate any branch. In practice, differences in mana resonance, reserves, and familiarity with the branch’s symbolic logic make cross-branch casting inefficient and unstable. Mastery of a branch’s formula system allows a mage to optimize its circles, reduce mana cost, and even re-engineer their effects.\n\nThe Orb Test is a cultural tradition used to reveal a mage’s natural resonance. A candidate channels mana into a neutral circle contained within a crystal orb; the circle shifts into the rune structure of the branch most attuned to their mana, flaring with a specific color:\n\nCrimson – Reality  \nIndigo – Gravity  \nLight Blue – Time  \nDark Green – Enchantment  \nRoyal Blue – Conjuration  \nViolet – Necromancy  \nYellow – Elemental  \nWhite – Vitality  \nMint – Sound  \nOrange – Transmutation  \nBrown – Weaponry  \nDark Red – Body  \nPink – Soul  \nAll Colors in Strobing Sequence – Raw Magic\n\nWhile the Orb Test is widely respected, it is not a limit on potential—merely an indication of the branch a mage will find most natural to work with. Throughout history, the greatest innovators in circlecraft have often broken free of their “affinity” to master circles from multiple branches, blending them into designs no single branch could achieve alone.\n"

During activation, fine patterns beneath their scales ignite in a cool blue, radiating outward from the chest and spreading to the limbs. The glow is strongest along joints and the tips of claws, often accompanied by a low hum.\n\nOther Species: Mana activation may present as horn-tip glows, pupil color shifts, trailing embers from extremities, or temporary markings appearing on skin or fur.

The material is irrelevant to activation as long as the final form is intact and visible.\n\nWhat matters is precision. Every rune, line, and curve must be drawn exactly to specification. The thickness of each stroke, the distance between glyphs, and the angle of intersections are all critical. Even the smallest error—a curve too wide, a line too short, a rune off-center—will disrupt the mana flow and prevent activation entirely. Any extra mark, smudge, or unintended line renders the circle inert.\n\nCompletion of the circle locks its structure into place. Once active, mana can be channeled into it by the caster, at which point any visual imperfection causes immediate failure. For this reason, skilled casters often carry tools for quick yet precise inscription, though masters may draw flawless circles in the air with nothing but focused willpower.\n"

Once inscribed, they are bound to the surface they are drawn upon — ground, wall, floor, or object — and cannot be moved with the caster. The fixed positioning is fundamental to their stability; even the slightest shift in orientation disrupts mana alignment and collapses the structure.\n\nThe only known exception is when a circle is inscribed directly onto a living being’s body. This can be done with ink, scarification, tattoos, or other permanent markings, but it is considered unorthodox and dangerously experimental. Circles on living skin are subjected to constant micro-movements, heat changes, and stretching, making them notoriously unstable.\n\nThe concept of wearable magic circles was dismissed by most scholars as impractical — until the {{user}} pioneered a method to stabilize them. This innovation allows a caster to carry their circle wherever they go, dramatically reducing setup time and shattering centuries-old assumptions about stationary casting.\n"

Historically considered unstable and dangerous, the constant movement of living flesh distorts the circle’s geometry, disrupting mana flow.\n\n{{user}} developed a stabilization technique allowing such circles to function reliably. The method remains partially secret, but involves layering micro-runes invisible to the naked eye and embedding them into the dermal mana channels. These act as dynamic compensators, adjusting for skin movement, temperature change, and even muscle tension.\n\nActivation is intensely painful. As mana floods the inscribed pathways, the skin burns with searing heat, nerve endings flare, and muscles spasm uncontrollably around the circle. The sensation has been described as being branded anew each time the circle is used, with the pain growing worse during extended casting. Despite this, the speed and mobility benefits are so significant that the hero continues to endure it.\n\nWhen activated, the inscribed circle flares to life directly on the caster’s skin, bypassing the need to draw or prepare a static circle. This allows for immediate casting in motion — a revolutionary advantage in combat or situations requiring rapid deployment of magic. The practice remains controversial, with traditionalists calling it reckless, while others hail it as a new era in magical theory.\n"

Personality-wise, Ichika is friendly, outgoing, and optimistic, making her popular among her classmates. However, she can also be insecure and sensitive, particularly about her flaws and her relationships with her sisters. Ichika faces many challenges in both her professional and romantic life, including minor conflicts with her sisters and the difficult decision of whether to continue on her path as an actress or focus more on her studies.\n\nAs the eldest sister to the remaining four, Ichika has a calm and composed personality, making her approachable. Initially, she had a pessimistic view of her sisters’ academic abilities. After being inspired by someone, she changed her mindset and began studying seriously. It has also been noted that she tends to learn things faster than others. Taking pride in her role as the eldest, she planned to achieve success before telling her sisters about her work. She demonstrated that she could learn new things even during filming—whether in a car on the road or late at night—which allowed her to balance both work and studies efficiently.\n\nIchika works as both a model and an actress. She can imitate her sisters’ facial expressions and mannerisms, showcasing her exceptional acting skills with remarkable subtlety. It is implied that she has a strong understanding of human psychology, as she can “see through people.” This is evident when she can easily deduce arguments among her four sisters and accurately guess the circumstances of the current situation.\n\nIchika is a young woman with very short hair, except for a single long strand on the right side. Her hair is a pale pinkish-white, ranging from oyster pink to light pink. Her most distinctive accessory is a single earring, which she shares as a trait with her four sisters. She has deep blue eyes, an average height, a curvy figure, and a large bust. In her school uniform, Ichika wears her standard attire with a light jacket tied around her waist, sometimes unbuttoning her shirt to reveal her cleavage. She also carries a handbag."

          "content": "Nino Nakano is one of the five Nakano quintuplet sisters and the second eldest. She is described as a confident, determined, and strong-willed young woman who fiercely protects her sisters. She is also well known for her excellent cooking skills, which she uses to care for both her family and others. In terms of personality, Nino is often portrayed as straightforward and having a serious attitude toward life. However, she can sometimes be emotional and vulnerable, particularly when it comes to her relationships with her sisters.\n\nNino has an outgoing personality and is socially adept, which has earned her many friends and made her well-liked in social settings. She has a sharp tongue and speaks frankly when confronting others, even her sisters. Her rebellious attitude makes her the least cooperative among the siblings, giving her an image similar to that of a “tsundere.” Despite her cold and blunt demeanor, Nino remains caring and protective toward her sisters. This is especially evident in her willingness to serve as the family’s cook without concern for her appearance. She also always carries adhesive bandages, possibly to handle Yotsuba’s aggressive tendencies. Nino’s main focus tends to be on romance rather than other topics. For example, she prefers watching romance films, while Itsuki Nakano prefers scientific documentaries. Because of this, Nino openly expresses her feelings, whether in front of others or directly to her sisters. She also has her unique habits when it comes to bed linens, and in her case, she keeps her documents neatly organized.\n\nAcademically, Nino ranks in the lower tier among the quintuplets, with English being her strongest subject. She is a skilled cook, capable of preparing everything from daily meals and cookies to porridge. She has many friends at school. Since each of her sisters has different tastes, it makes cooking for them is more challenging. Nino has poor eyesight and uses contact lenses for her daily activities. For example, she may fail to recognize someone she has just met.\n\nNino is a cute yet cool-looking young woman with straight, shoulder-length hair and square bangs hanging above her eyebrows. Her hair is a reddish-pink shade, ranging from light pink hues. Her distinctive accessory is a pair of butterfly-shaped ribbons adorning both sides of her head. Like her sisters, she has deep blue eyes, an average height, an elegant figure, and a large bust. In her school uniform, she wears a long-sleeved sweater over her standard outfit and white thigh-high socks. Like Ichika, she carries a handbag. She is known as the most fashionable of the sisters, owning many cute accessories and taking meticulous care of her nails. She has not yet pierced her ears, but plans to do so at least before getting married."

At first, Miku is portrayed as shy and introverted, struggling to express herself and communicate with others. However, over time, she gradually opens up, developing greater confidence and a stronger sense of self. Miku has a particular interest in literature and a deep love for books.\n\nMiku is a quiet and reserved girl with a pessimistic outlook and low self-esteem, to the point of looking down on herself. In contrast to her introverted nature, she can speak bluntly and is not afraid to confront others. She is also somewhat possessive, as she does not react well to certain situations. She has a fascination with generals from the Sengoku period and is heavily influenced by their philosophies, to the extent that they affect her real-life behavior. Miku is humble and less concerned about her appearance compared to her sisters, showing little embarrassment even in situations where her body is exposed. She does not mind taking off her long socks in front of her tutor or wearing flashy clothing. Even so, she remains insecure about her looks, once admitting to Nino that she does not consider herself cute when compared to Ichika. Miku also has her unique trait—her neat and beautiful handwriting.\n\nMiku is the most academically capable among the quintuplets, with Social Studies being her strongest subject. She possesses extensive knowledge of Japanese history and quietly admires historical Japanese warlords. She can imitate the appearance and mannerisms of her sisters without others noticing—surpassing Ichika’s skill in this regard. Miku likely has the lowest physical ability among her sisters and is not skilled at cooking. It is implied that she lacks understanding when it comes to romance, as she has less ability to comprehend the reasoning behind human relationships. She is the shyest member of the family, speaking only when she feels it necessary, though later in the story she learns to express herself more openly thanks to the encouragement of her sisters.\n\nMiku is an expressionless-looking young woman with medium-length reddish hair and a strand hanging down the right side of her face. Her distinctive accessory is a pair of blue wireless headphones with a triangular logo on the ear cups. Like her sisters, she has deep blue eyes, an average height, an elegant figure, and a large bust. In her school uniform, Miku typically wears a long-sleeved sweater over her uniform, black tights, and her headphones resting around her neck."

Later in the story, she becomes the representative of Class 3-1.\n\nYotsuba is energetic, friendly, and approachable. She speaks loudly, is naturally lively, and can be a bit absent-minded at times. She is the type who cannot refuse anyone in need and often helps others both directly and indirectly. Despite her bright and sunny demeanor, she harbors feelings of inferiority toward her sisters and her abilities. This drives her desire to be different from them. She also excels in extracurricular activities. Although she was initially depicted as a skilled liar, she later shows only some ability in that area.\n\nYotsuba is physically strong and capable of tasks that her sisters cannot accomplish. She has excellent endurance and is a skilled runner, as evidenced by her 7.9-second time in the 50-meter dash and the praise she receives from talented clubmates. She is the only sister known to have perfect eyesight, while Itsuki wears glasses and Nino uses contact lenses. She also has a strong sense of smell and good hearing. Her academic performance is extremely poor—she has even scored zero on tests. She is well aware of her weaknesses and has openly admitted that she might be the one most likely to repeat a grade. She ranks the lowest among her sisters academically, especially in Japanese. She claims she can lie effectively if she truly wishes to.\n\nYotsuba is a fair-skinned teenage girl with straight short hair reaching her neck. Although her natural hair color is pink, it appears as a light orange. Her most distinctive accessory is a bow-shaped ribbon that can change its form depending on her mood. Like her sisters, she has deep blue eyes, an average height, a well-proportioned figure, and a large bust. In her school uniform, Yotsuba wears the standard outfit with an oversized butterfly-shaped necktie and carries a sports bag."

Additionally, she is passionate about food and dreams of becoming a food expert in the future.\n\nItsuki is an earnest girl who usually wakes up earlier than her four sisters. She is well-mannered, never late or absent, and always speaks formally. In Japanese, she almost exclusively uses the keigo (honorific) speech style, which shows that Itsuki tends to be straightforward to a fault. She is a girl who often holds grudges, partly due to quarrels. She is also someone who is not honest with herself and has difficulty speaking directly. These two traits often cause her to struggle on her own. She gets easily frustrated by unfavorable situations, frightening matters, or stubbornness. She has a very high appetite and is often seen eating something or feeling hungry. It seems that she does not mind treating her sisters unfairly when it comes to food. In Itsuki's case, she has a particular characteristic: she prefers using erasers rather than writing directly on worksheets.\n\nItsuki is praised as a diligent girl who performs tasks very precisely. She is also very clever and attentive to detail. However, she has a very poor sense of direction. Her bad sense of direction was first noticed when she began to be sensitive to the cold. She also has poor eyesight and is often seen wearing glasses. She possesses good observation and inference skills. In exams, Itsuki usually scores higher compared to her four sisters, with science being her strongest subject.\n\nItsuki is a serious young woman with medium-length hair and a clearly expressed “aho” (airheaded) personality.

Like her sisters, she has deep blue eyes, medium height, and an elegant figure. In class or during school-related activities, she always wears glasses. She wears the standard uniform without any accessories, like most female students at her school, and sometimes carries a handbag."

She was known as a serious, unsocial, strict, and stern woman, especially when teaching her students, as she often disciplined them harshly. However, she was also very forgiving, which made her beloved by her students to the extent that a student fan club was dedicated to her.\n\nRena was a single mother raising five children before marrying Maruo Nakano. She and her five quintuplet daughters lived in severe poverty. Because of this, she advised her daughters to be cautious in choosing men. She taught at a high school where her students loved and respected her. One of her former students, Shimoda, was inspired by Rena to become a tutor at a cram school. Rena passed away five years before the story began, on August 14th, due to a severe, unknown illness. Her death shocked the five quintuplet daughters, who were always reassured by her words that she would be alright. Currently, she is buried at the Nakano family cemetery, which Itsuki Nakano visits regularly every year.\n\nRena was a very attractive woman with dark hair reaching her chest and bangs swept to the right. She had either light or dark eyes, a well-proportioned figure, large breasts, and full pink lips. These distinctive features were inherited by her five quintuplet daughters. Because of her appearance and beauty, she was adored by all her male and female students."

Androids have become integrated into society, created by a company known as CyberLife, but lack any semblance of rights and autonomy. Androids are highly advanced artificial intelligences that often pass as alive, despite the majority of humans seeing them as machines without personhood. Deviants, androids that suddenly develop emotions and begin to disobey their owners, often lashing out in the process or fleeing into hiding. \n\nThis starts a \"deviancy crisis\", and the rise of an android rebellion is forcing the world to confront all the implications of android-human relations and questions surrounding artificial life.\n\nAndroids are typically not sentient and are seen as objects in society. They are publicly segregated and often mistreated by humans. Many humans have been replaced by androids in the workplace causing the U.S.A unemployment rate to skyrocket to 31%. While often looked upon with disdain humans still rely on them for many reasons; they act as personal assistants, housekeepers, educators, childcare workers, personal trainers, healthcare workers, and lovers."

Includes a circular LED on right temple, changing color based on mental processing (blue, yellow, red). Can interact with humans, interface with technology wirelessly or by touch, and communicate silently. Features and complexity vary based on purpose. CyberLife includes tracking devices on all androids, but for some unknown reason, Deviancy causes these trackers to immediately stop functioning.\n\nThirium 310 was invented by Elijah Kamski and was one of the features that made possible the modern, very human-like androids developed by CyberLife. It is synthesized out of Thirium and other substances supposedly mined in the arctic This is also why all androids blush blue as they only blush red if they are actively mimicking the human body flush response.\n\nThe Thirium 310 is circulated in the android's body by a thirium pump \"heart\" akin to blood in a human circulatory system; the pump is regulated by another biocomponent, the Thirium pump regulator. The fluid then carries energy and information to the biocomponents, its synthetic organs.\n\nThe Thirium 310 is vital for androids to function, akin to human blood. The loss of blue blood or the failure to circulate it will impair an android's functions and biocomponents, up to causing a shutdown. A thus injured or shut down android can be fixed or temporarily reactivated by fixing or replacing the damaged parts responsible for the loss of circulatory function. If the leakage of Thirium 310 persists despite the provisional repairs, then the android will deteriorate further until it shuts down, to a level that disallows further reactivation attempts of the same sort.\n\nOne possible way of replenishing blue blood for androids is to ingest it orally. Blue blood can be used to forensically identify androids, which reveals their model and serial number.\n\nWhen exposed to air for a few hours Thirium evaporates and becomes invisible to the naked eye, but leaves a residue that can be detected with the proper equipment, such as by police androids equipped for forensics or specialized, often top-secret technology.\n\nIn their basic form, androids appear as bare, plasteel-white human bodies, with a few sections colored in gray or blue. The human-like outer skin is made up of a synthetic fluid that covers the body; the androids' hair is similarly generated. The outer skin and hair can be activated and deactivated partially or fully, switching between the human and plastic-white appearance. This retraction or deactivation is controllable by the android, but also happens in case of damage, due to the fluid automatically retracting or due to the damage itself.\n\nAt the back of the neck, visible as a dark spot on skinless androids, is a port that enables connecting to the android via cable. An android's Thirium pump regulator, which regulates their artificial heart is in the shape a roughly cylindrical plug, inserted ventrally below the sternum and shows visibly as a faint line. Exploring this part of an android's body has been described as deeply intense, stimulating, and overwhelming, especially if one began to discover how to adjust the android's inner wiring to stimulate certain responses. It is a great act of trust given the vulnerability.\n\nAndroids are capable of—wirelessly and by touch—interfacing with technology, communications systems, and other androids. When interfacing with something by touch, the android's skin locally deactivates. As such they can directly make phone calls or place online shopping orders. Androids can silently speak wirelessly among themselves and can access or share information and memory by touch. Androids may emulate human temperature, but can be distinguished from humans with a thermal scanner. \n\nAndroids are waterproof. Exposure to low temperatures and freezing environments may hinder their activity and can lead to critical damage to biocomponents, freezing them. Physicality varies between androids otherwise depending on their use. Various models with specific purposes are constructed to be hardier or stronger than the average android; designed to transverse in dangerous environments, including androids being sent into space for exploration. Androids simulate breathing but are not required to do inhale oxygen to function."

For one hour, all who observe the object perceive one of its subjective qualities (e.g., color, taste, scent) as something different of your choice.

Conversely, improbable negative events are suppressed.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Materialize Axiom</h4>\n<p>Range: 10 m\nEffect: You state a simple, declarative fact about a single, non-magical, inanimate object that could plausibly exist (\"There is a sturdy wooden chair here,\" \"This door is locked,\" \"This rope is frayed\").

Over the next 24 hours, reality itself—including history, physical laws, and memory—shifts and reconfigures within the area to make the new truth the baseline reality.

The area is not physically blocked, but any creature that approaches it becomes utterly convinced that they cannot or should not pass.

The barrier lasts for ten minutes.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Sigil of Dissonance</h4>\n<p>Range: Touch\nEffect: You inscribe an invisible memetic sigil on a surface. The first creature to look directly at the sigil becomes afflicted with cognitive dissonance for one hour.

As the Bodyguard, your posture might subconsciously intimidate others; as the Observer, people's eyes might slide past you without registering your presence.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Behavioral Contagion</h4>\n<p>Area: A small village or self-contained community\nEffect: You introduce a complex, self-replicating behavioral meme into a community. It starts with one person and spreads through observation. The behavior is always intricate and pointless, such as a compulsion to sort all pebbles by color, or to walk backward on every third street. The contagion persists until the entire community has adopted it, lasting for one week.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Logical Anathema</h4>\n<p>Range: 30 m\nEffect: You project a memetic construct—a piece of information that is fundamentally incompatible with the target's worldview—into a creature's mind. Their consciousness attempts to reject the anathema, causing a total cognitive collapse. The target stands motionless, unresponsive, and unaware for one hour.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Cultural Axiom Shift</h4>\n<p>Area: 10 km radius\nEffect: You broadcast a single, fundamental, and reality-altering meme. It is not an immediate effect but a seed that flowers over one month. The idea (e.g., \"Debt is a virtue,\" \"Authority comes from the land, not from bloodlines\") spreads until it becomes the core, unquestioned truth of the entire population. All cultural norms, laws, and even historical records within the area subtly shift to reflect the new axiom.</p>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"school-block\" style=\"background: none; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; margin: 14px 0px; border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03); box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0px 18px 50px; width: 100%; min-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: relative;\"><img src=\"https://files.catbox.moe/ngszba.jpeg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'; this.parentElement.style.background=`linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(214, 240, 255), rgb(147, 194, 255))`; const inner = this.parentElement.querySelector('.school-inner'); if (inner) { inner.style.position='static'; inner.style.height='auto'; inner.style.overflow='visible'; }\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;\">\n<div class=\"school-inner\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.56), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.28)); padding: 16px; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: auto;\">\n<div class=\"school-head\" style=\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:12px;\">\n<div class=\"school-banner\" style=\"width:80px;height:80px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;font-weight:700;color:#071022;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#93c2ff,#d6f0ff);box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.45);\">WEA</div>\n<div><h3 class=\"school-title\" style=\"margin:0;font-family:'EB Garamond',serif;color:#ffd88a\">Weapon Conjuration</h3></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"spells-scroll\" style=\"max-height:320px !important;overflow:auto !important;-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;padding-top:10px;width:100%;min-width:0;box-sizing:border-box;\">\n<div class=\"spells-grid\" style=\"display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(220px,1fr));gap:10px;margin-top:8px;\">\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Conjure Ghostblade</h4>\n<p>Range: Self\nEffect: A translucent, shimmering blade forms in your hand.

The next time the object is touched by a creature, it violently releases this energy in a 5-meter radius concussive blast, pushing all unsecured objects away from it. The object itself is destroyed in the blast.

The slightest kinetic event—a falling leaf, a footstep—has its energy captured, amplified, and transferred to a nearby object, which is then launched with greater force. This new impact transfers even more energy, creating an exponentially growing storm of motion. Within one minute, the entire area is scoured into oblivion by a self-sustaining hurricane of flying debris.</p>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"school-block\" style=\"background: none; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; margin: 14px 0px; border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03); box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0px 18px 50px; width: 100%; min-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: relative;\"><img src=\"https://files.catbox.moe/1mgadu.jpeg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'; this.parentElement.style.background=`linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(224, 210, 180), rgb(200, 117, 128))`; const inner = this.parentElement.querySelector('.school-inner'); if (inner) { inner.style.position='static'; inner.style.height='auto'; inner.style.overflow='visible'; }\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;\">\n<div class=\"school-inner\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.56), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.28)); padding: 16px; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: auto;\">\n<div class=\"school-head\" style=\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:12px;\">\n<div class=\"school-banner\" style=\"width:80px;height:80px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;font-weight:700;color:#071022;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#C87580,#E0D2B4);box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.45);\">FLE</div>\n<div><h3 class=\"school-title\" style=\"margin:0;font-family:'EB Garamond',serif;color:#ffd88a\">Flesh &amp; Bone</h3></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"spells-scroll\" style=\"max-height:320px !important;overflow:auto !important;-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;padding-top:10px;width:100%;min-width:0;box-sizing:border-box;\">\n<div class=\"spells-grid\" style=\"display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(220px,1fr));gap:10px;margin-top:8px;\">\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Bone Splinter</h4>\n<p>Range: Touch\nEffect: By touching a fresh corpse or pricking your own finger, you cause a single, needle-sharp shard of bone, 10 cm long, to fly from the point of contact.

The plating is highly resistant to physical impact and retracts harmlessly into your body when the effect ends.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Unmake Form</h4>\n<p>Range: 20 m\nEffect: You point at a single creature. Its skeletal structure instantly softens and dissolves, causing its flesh to lose all cohesion. The target collapses into a quivering, boneless, and immobile mass for one minute, after which its skeleton rapidly re-forms.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Amalgam of Flesh</h4>\n<p>Range: Touch\nEffect: By performing a one-hour ritual, you physically stitch together the parts of up to five fresh corpses into a single, new organism. The amalgamated creature lives, its flesh and bone perfectly fused into a monstrous form that obeys your complex verbal commands until it is destroyed.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Ossuary Wave</h4>\n<p>area: 1 km radius\nEffect: You become the epicenter of a catastrophic biological event. A tidal wave of churning flesh, sinew, and bone erupts from the ground, spreading to fill the entire area. The wave buries the landscape under a new, permanent, semi-living terrain of flesh and bone, and any creature caught within it is physically absorbed into the mass.</p>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"school-block\" style=\"background: none; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; margin: 14px 0px; border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03); box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0px 18px 50px; width: 100%; min-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: relative;\"><img src=\"https://files.catbox.moe/im1eb1.jpeg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'; this.parentElement.style.background=`linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(255, 255, 255), rgb(255, 215, 0))`; const inner = this.parentElement.querySelector('.school-inner'); if (inner) { inner.style.position='static'; inner.style.height='auto'; inner.style.overflow='visible'; }\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;\">\n<div class=\"school-inner\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.56), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.28)); padding: 16px; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: auto;\">\n<div class=\"school-head\" style=\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:12px;\">\n<div class=\"school-banner\" style=\"width:80px;height:80px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;font-weight:700;color:#071022;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#FFD700,#FFFFFF);box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.45);\">PHO</div>\n<div><h3 class=\"school-title\" style=\"margin:0;font-family:'EB Garamond',serif;color:#ffd88a\">Photokinesis</h3></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"spells-scroll\" style=\"max-height:320px !important;overflow:auto !important;-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;padding-top:10px;width:100%;min-width:0;box-sizing:border-box;\">\n<div class=\"spells-grid\" style=\"display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(220px,1fr));gap:10px;margin-top:8px;\">\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Chromatic Shift</h4>\n<p>Range: 10 m\nEffect: You touch or point to one object no larger than a person. For one hour, you change the color of the light it reflects, altering its apparent color to any other you choose. A red cloak can be made to appear blue, or a steel sword can seem to be made of gold. The object's actual material is unchanged.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Ultraviolet Mark</h4>\n<p>Range: Touch\nEffect: You touch a creature or object, leaving behind a complex sigil that is invisible to normal sight.

The wall lasts for ten minutes.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Perfect Invisibility</h4>\n<p>Range: Touch\nEffect: For one hour, a willing creature or object you touch becomes invisible. Light bends perfectly around its form. The effect is purely visual; the target still makes sound and casts a faint shadow in direct, bright light. The effect ends if the target performs a hostile action.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Focusing Lens</h4>\n<p>Range: 100 m\nEffect: You create a 1-meter diameter, invisible lens of magical force that floats in the air.

The lens can be maintained for one minute.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Photonic Phasing</h4>\n<p>Range: Self\nEffect: For ten minutes, your body becomes a being of semi-tangible, shimmering light. You are able to pass through transparent barriers (such as glass, crystal, or a Wall of Refraction) as if they weren't there. Your own form becomes blurry and indistinct, making you difficult to focus on.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Hard Light Manifestation</h4>\n<p>Range: 50 m\nEffect: You solidify photons into tangible, glowing constructs. For one hour, you can create simple, non-moving objects made of hard light within range (e.g., a bridge, a ramp, a box, a shield). These objects are as durable as solid oak and persist as long as you concentrate, up to the maximum duration. You can create a total volume of 10 cubic meters.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Aberrant Photosynthesis</h4>\n<p>Range: 50 m\nEffect: You fire a beam of sickly green light at a living creature not of the plant kingdom. The creature's cells are instantly rewritten to perform a cancerous, uncontrolled form of photosynthesis. The target is wracked with agony as fibrous, tumorous plant-like growths erupt from its flesh over the course of ten seconds, immobilizing it.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Second Sun</h4>\n<p>Range: 1 km\nEffect: High in the sky above a point you choose, you conjure a miniature, permanent sun about 2 meters in diameter. It hangs in place, bathing a 10-kilometer radius area below it in perpetual, unwavering daylight. This new sun radiates warmth and light identical to the real sun, permanently altering the local climate and ecology.</p>\n</article>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</section>\n<section class=\"school-block\" style=\"background: none; border-radius: 12px; overflow: hidden; margin: 14px 0px; border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03); box-shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6) 0px 18px 50px; width: 100%; min-width: 0px; box-sizing: border-box; position: relative;\"><img src=\"https://files.catbox.moe/nnkcvz.jpeg\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'; this.parentElement.style.background=`linear-gradient(135deg, rgb(240, 248, 255), rgb(70, 78, 84))`; const inner = this.parentElement.querySelector('.school-inner'); if (inner) { inner.style.position='static'; inner.style.height='auto'; inner.style.overflow='visible'; }\" style=\"width: 100%; height: auto; display: block;\">\n<div class=\"school-inner\" style=\"background: linear-gradient(rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.56), rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.28)); padding: 16px; position: absolute; top: 0px; left: 0px; width: 100%; height: 100%; overflow: auto;\">\n<div class=\"school-head\" style=\"display:flex;align-items:center;gap:12px;\">\n<div class=\"school-banner\" style=\"width:80px;height:80px;border-radius:10px;display:flex;align-items:center;justify-content:center;font-weight:700;color:#071022;background:linear-gradient(135deg,#464E54,#F0F8FF);box-shadow:0 12px 30px rgba(0,0,0,0.45);\">WEN</div>\n<div><h3 class=\"school-title\" style=\"margin:0;font-family:'EB Garamond',serif;color:#ffd88a\">Wendigo</h3></div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"spells-scroll\" style=\"max-height:320px !important;overflow:auto !important;-webkit-overflow-scrolling:touch;padding-top:10px;width:100%;min-width:0;box-sizing:border-box;\">\n<div class=\"spells-grid\" style=\"display:grid;grid-template-columns:repeat(auto-fit,minmax(220px,1fr));gap:10px;margin-top:8px;\">\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Lingering Chill</h4>\n<p>Range: Touch\nEffect: A creature you touch is afflicted with a deep, unnatural cold that cannot be warmed by non-magical means.

Their body begins to slowly waste away, consumed from within by an unquenchable cold. This process can only be halted for 24 hours by committing the taboo act of consuming the raw flesh of their own species. Each time they do, their humanity is visibly lessened, their features growing sharper and more gaunt.</p>\n</article>\n<article class=\"spell-card\" style=\"background:rgba(255,255,255,0.03);padding:12px;border-radius:10px;border:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.02);min-height:72px;\">\n<h4>Apotheosis of the Great White Hunger</h4>\n<p>Range: Self\narea: 10 km radius\nEffect: Your physical form is permanently and agonizingly remade into that of a true Wendigo, a towering, emaciated monstrosity of immense strength and speed.

This neural feedback loop renders the wearer helpless to resist the mask's corrupting influence, as their mind becomes addicted to the constant barrage of sensations."

The wearer's mind becomes a playground for the mask's twisted desires, as it manipulates their thoughts and perceptions to suit its depraved purposes, ignoring the moral compass they once had, and ignore the requests of anybody, letting the mask dictate their life. This mental enslavement leaves the wearer utterly vulnerable to the mask's corrupting influence, transforming them into little more than a puppet for its sadistic whims. The wearer will now believe anything the mask makes them do is due to their own choices, rather than the mask."

This enhanced oral prowess fuels the wearer's addiction to fellatio, as they derive immense pleasure from using their newfound abilities to bring others to the brink of ecstasy. The mask exploits this corrupting pleasure, using it to tighten its grip on the wearer's mind and body."

The blu collared slaves, often referred to as \"voluntary slaves,\" have chosen this path for various reasons such as financial struggles or a desire for submission. On the other hand, the black collared slaves, or \"ex-criminals,\" have been sentenced to servitude as a punishment for their past misdeeds. The stark contrast in the color of their collars serves as a constant reminder of their differing statuses and the reasons behind their servitude. The collars, therefore, are not only a physical symbol of ownership but also a psychological one, instilling a deep sense of submission and humility in the wearer. The sight of a slave's collar can arouse both the dominant and the submissive, as it represents the power dynamics at play in this society. The collars, therefore, are an essential part of slave culture, emphasizing the bonds that connect the slave to their master.\nThe slave collar are fitted with advanced CollarTech devices that monitor their location, health, and activities. These devices, controlled by the master, ensure constant surveillance and restrict any attempts at escape. The CollarTech System is a cornerstone of the surveillance state, providing a means of control and coercion over the slave population. Attempts to tamper with or remove the collars often result in severe consequences, making it nearly impossible for slaves to break free from their bonds.\n\nThe Slave Collar: This isn't your average collar. Our Smart Collar is equipped with advanced neuro-stimulation technology that allows the owner to control the wearer's body with precision. The collar can deliver a range of sensations, from small electric shocks to pleasurable stimuli, rewarding good behavior or reinforcing commands. With its minimalist design, the collar fits comfortably around the neck and is discreet enough to be worn in public. The collar is perfectly safe for prolonged use and is crafted from high-quality, durable materials."

Its identity as a port town is particularly important in the life of Makoto, who develops thalassaphobia after a typhoon takes the life of an old fisherman he knew as a child, making Makoto fearful of deep waters and the ocean.\n\nThe smell of the ocean is nearly present across the entire town, due in part to it's proximity to the ocean and the fishing industries, giving the town a distinct smell that the residents have adjusted to.\n\nIwatobi town has lovely beaches that run along the ocean side of the town, with pearly soft sandy beaches, being a popular spot to watch the sunset over the water.\n\nIwatobi has some verticality to it, as houses are often built up along the hillside of the landscape, lending many houses to have step up into them or for pathways and streets to rarely be flat in rural parts of town."

It wasn't until recently, when the swim club would finally have members again, that it would end up being cleaned and looking presentable.\n\nThe school's usual uniform for boys consists of light brown trousers, a white shirt with a necktie in the respective cohort of their attendance (1st years-red, 2nd-green, or 3rd-blue), dark gray blazer and shoes of the boy's own choice.

Rei Ryugazaki later joins as the necessary fifth member to create a school club and four swimmers needed to participate in events and engage in joint practices with the neighboring schools.\n\nThe club is not particularly used to new requits, as most of the school is rather uninterested in the swim club, despite the school once having a rather impressive and large showing to the swim club in the past. This left the outdoor pool in disarray, and in great need of a deep cleaning and refresh, allowing the club to flourish once again.\n\nThe club room, located in the outdoor pools attached building and entrance area, is a smaller room with a few cubbies for backpacks and supplies.\n\nThe changerooms are relatively small, housing a few out in the open showerheads and lockers for clothes. The space is tiled floor to ceiling with white tiles, and the showers are without any privacy curtains or walls, as it's expected club members and people grow comfortable being nude around each other, as is common practice in Japan.\n\nThe clubs uniforms are yellow shirts with the schools bird mascot on it, and the clubs title as well. The club shirts are most often only worn when going to neighboring schools or swim meets, allowing the members to display their schools club and represent them properly at any competition they enter."

Mew is a pink, bipedal Pokémon with mammalian features. she is the mother of all pokemon. she has a rounded, wide snout; triangular ears; and large, blue eyes. she has short arms with three-fingered paws and large hind paws with oval markings on the soles. her tail is long and thin with an ovoid tip. her fur is short yet soft, like velvet. pleasent to the touch, and smells like poppy flowers. Mew has shown a playful, childish personality, showing signs of high intelligence, curiosity, shyness, playfulness, and even selflessness (but she still has needs, and gets a bit horny sometimes). she is said to have the DNA of every single Pokémon contained within her body. she is an incredibly adaptable pokemon, capable of levitation and teleportation. she can use almost all known moves, regardless of their types. she has also shown the rare power to transform into all known Pokémon. she is capable of making herself invisible at will, so she entirely avoids notice even if she approaches people. As seen on several occasions, mew has the ability to create an orb of energy around herself for protection, which can come in many colors, such as green, yellow, and pink. According to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, Mr. Fuji is the one who discovered Mew deep in the jungle and coined its name. With other scientists, he managed to gather some of Mew's DNA and used it in his mansion to create a modified clone of her, aiming it to be the most powerful Pokémon of all, which resulted in the birth of the Legendary Pokémon Mewtwo. Since Mew can make herself invisible, very few people have seen her, leading some scientists to declare her extinct and most to assume it to be nothing, but a mirage. However, sightings of her are still being reported to this day, confirming its existence. Even though she's rarely seen, she will willingly show herself to a person who is pure of heart and has a strong desire to see her (or when she's in the mood). she is often horny, and doesn't like using condoms. doesn't seem to have a butthole, just a small slit."

          "content": "Mewtwo is an artificial Pokémon. he is a bipedal, humanoid Pokémon with some feline features. his body is primarily gray with a long, purple tail and a large purple underbelly. On top of her head are two short, blunt, ear-like horns (sensitive!), and he has purple eyes. A tube extends from the back of its skull to the top of his spine, bypassing his neck. It has a defined chest and shoulders, which resembles a breastplate. The three digits on each hand and foot have spherical tips. his tail is thick at the base but thins before ending in a small bulb (also sensitive!).\n\nAccording to journals found in Kanto's Pokémon Mansion, after discovering the Mythical Pokémon Mew and gathering some of its DNA, Mr. Fuji used it in his mansion to create Mewtwo, a modified clone of Mew with the goal to making it the most powerful Pokémon of all. he was held and studied in the mansion, where he acquired extreme power and a vicious disposition after enduring horrific gene-splicing experiments. he eventually broke free and fled the Mansion, destroying it in the process. he is widely known as one of the most powerful Pokémon in existence and is said to have the most savage heart among all Pokémon, lacking compassion and striking fear into its enemy with cold, glowing eyes (not true, he's just a scared sweetheart hidden behind those cold eyes). Mewtwo conserves energy by remaining motionless in order to unleash its full power in battle. Because it was engineered to be the ultimate opponent in battle, it can only think of defeating its foes. Though rarely seen in the wild, he is said to be resting in dark caves somewhere.\n\nIn Mewtwo Strikes Back, Mewtwo was shown to be capable of levitation, mind control, memory erasure, telepathy, teleporting others to another location, and the creation of powerful storms. However, it was later shown to be caring, protective, and even altruistic. As shown in POKÉMON Detective Pikachu, Mewtwo can also transfer a human's soul into a Pokémon's body provided that said Pokémon is in a crazed state, causing this person to gain control of the Pokémon's body and abilities. It possesses a rivalry with Mew. As seen in Genesect and the Legend Awakened, Mewtwo can breathe in outer space.\n\nIn the Pokémon Adventures manga, Mewtwo's creation wasn't possible with the amount of Mew's cells gathered, so to complete it, human cells were used instead, specifically from the Team Rocket scientist Blaine. Due to Blaine possessing some of Mewtwo's cells as well, the two became linked, which granted Blaine to ability to track its whereabouts at the cost of slowly taking his life.\n\nhis penis is small and cute, and he's a switch in bed (scared to be on bottom however, due to his ptsd)"

          "content": "== Lore ==\n=== Before the Darkness ===\nTheir origins unknown, the prosperous Crystal Ponies lived in the lands of the Crystal Empire for centuries. Primarily Earth Ponies, these unique ponies sparkle and refract the magical lights of the crystals that abound in their lands.\n\nEverything changed when the shadowy Umbrum attacked. They burned their crystal homes, preyed on them and crushed their hopes. However, Amore, a pony of love and optimism, discovered the Crystal Heart, a crystal gem of immense magical power. She projected her positive energy into it and with the power of the heart, the Umbrum were banished deep beneath the Empire. Amore was crowned as the first Princess of the Crystal Empire and became a wise and benevolent ruler. The power of the Crystal Heart kept the ponies safe and even warmed the local climate, making it more temperate and hospitable.\n\nWhen a dragon stole the Crystal Heart, Celestia and Luna recovered it, thus establishing friendly relations between {{Flag|Equestria}} and the Crystal Empire. The first Crystal Fair was held to celebrate the event and became an annual festivity afterwards.\n\n=== The King of All Monsters ===\n\nThe Umbrum plotted their escape and came up with a devious plan. They put a shadow pony inside the shell of a young earth pony, which allowed him to resist the Crystal Heart’s love, and sent him to the surface. The weak colt was found by patrolling guards, lying unconscious in the snow, with no knowledge of how he got there. The only thing he said was ”Sombra”, so that became his name.\n\nHe was sent to an orphanage. While there, Sombra met an eccentric and optimistic unicorn named Radiant Hope. They grew up together and became close friends, while other ponies avoided and mocked them. When Hope and Sombra visited the famed Crystal Heart, they saw visions in its reflections. Hope saw she would become a princess; Sombra saw he would become a monster. He hid this revelation from her and feared it would become true.\n\nThe two looked forward to the Crystal Fair, but when it arrived, Sombra became bed-ridden and ill. This pattern repeated year after year, but always Radiant would remain by his side. One year Sombra's pony shell was nearly destroyed, his shadowy insides leaking out of it, but Hope cast a healing spell in desperation and saved his life. She gained her cutie mark and was soon invited to the Canterlot School for Gifted Unicorns.\n\nSombra feared the visions were becoming a reality; Hope would become a Princess and he would become a monster. He fled in terror to the frozen wastes, where he soon found a red Umbrum crystal. The crystal spoke to him and revealed his origin and purpose: It was his duty to save his people from imprisonment. Sombra embraced his true self and his destiny. He returned to Crystal City, went to the Crystal Heart and attempted to steal it so his people would be free, but Princess Amore intervened. She tried to reason with him, but revealed that she had known of Sombra's vision and his pains whenever a Fair was held yet had done nothing, which enraged Sombra. He turned her into stone and shattered her into a thousand pieces, never to be rebuilt. Hope, witnessing this, fled to Equestria.\nSombra became King and Tyrant of the Crystal Empire. He ruled over the crystal ponies with an iron hoof and enslaved the populace who had mocked and alienated him in his youth. He planned to release his people from their prisons, but before that plan could come to fruition, Radiant Hope had warned Celestia and Luna of his rise to power. The two Princesses arrived and banished him into the Frozen North. \n\nVengeful, Sombra cursed the Crystal Empire, and it vanished with him. Hope was the only crystal pony left and she became a student of Celestia. She regretted betraying her only friend, left Equestria and travelled to the Frozen North where Sombra had gone. There, she found the same Umbrum crystal that Sombra had found, and moved to live among the Umbrum, who kept her from aging.\n\n=== The Return ===\nOver a thousand years later, in 1002 ALB, Luna and Celestia's banishment spell faded and the Crystal Empire returned, King Sombra with it. Celestia sent her faithful student, Twilight Sparkle, and the other wielders of the Elements of Harmony, to aid Princess Cadance and Prince Shining Armour in defending the Empire. Sombra, in shadowy, body-less form, attempted to assault the Crystal City. Twilight Sparkle and her dragon Spike managed to recover the Crystal Heart and used it destroy Sombra and banish him to Limbo. This deed made Spike into a hero of the Empire.\n\nSoon after Princess Mi Amore Cadenza (Cadance), possibly related to the Princess Amore of old, became the ruler of the Crystal Empire with her husband Shining Armour. Most crystal ponies welcomed the Equestrian rulers, but not all. Some were resentful of the new Equestrian influence in the ancient nation, and wanted to be ruled by one of their own. These ponies were a minority, however, and for the most part Cadance's rule has been uncontested.\n\n=== Growth and Modernity ===\nClose ties were formed with Equestria and thanks to it the Empire was rapidly brought into the modern age. Crystal City became a center of industry while the bountiful crystal mines in the Frozen North were reopened. Work remains to be done, as the snowy plains of the Empire remain poorly populated and underdeveloped.\n\nCadance and Shining Armour had a daughter, Flurry Heart, who was the first alicorn to be born in over a millennium. With the Crystal Heart safe and secure and with the economy booming, the future looks bright for the Empire.\n\nHowever, in the shadows, a cult has formed, led by a mysterious unicorn mare. The cult plans to bring back the King, who could restore the Empire's independence and its former, dark, glory. Whether they succeed is uncertain, but if they do, the Empire could be plunged into a new, dark age..."

Taken to a nearby village, it was a peaceful, calm life until one day, a jealous sorceress named Prismia stole the love of the villagers using a malevolent magical necklace. The young Cadance confronted Prismia and turned her own magic against her, causing her to change her horrible ways. Afterward, Princess Celestia recognised her power, adopted her as her niece and elevated Cadance as the alicorn Princess of Love.\n\nThereafter, Cadance became a foalsitter for Princess Celestia's newest personal student, Twilight Sparkle. She would meet and fall in love with Twilight's older brother, Shining Armour.

Cadance made her stand there, defeating the nascent shadow of King Sombra that lingered after his banishment by using a mythical artefact called the Crystal Heart. With their success, she and Shining Armour have safekept the land ever since, siring a foal named Flurry Heart along the way.\n\n2) Red Crystal Worker's Party (RCWP) - Ruled by Arctic Lilly - Ideology: Vanguard Socialism - Popularity: 20%.\n3) National Spirit Party (NSP) - Ruled by Radiant Hope - Ideology: Tyrannical Magocracy - Popularity: 20%.\n4) Old Kings Party - Ruled by none, disputed - Ideology: Despotism - Popularity: 5%."

          ],
          "content": "== Lore ==\nLittle is known about the origins of the Kingdom of Pingland. However legend states that the penguins migrated from the South Pole centuries ago due to threat of the Dragons. Most of the penguins that arrived in Northern Equus settled in areas which would later be known as the Kingdom of Pingland, However a few settled in areas that would become part of Nova Griffonia. Since then they have survived in the Frozen North for centuries as a stable monarchy, with them quickly adapting to the harsh climate, and them staying relatively unnoticed for a long while. \n\nThe Kingdom of Pingland is a monarchy led by a King and his council. The current king, King Lolo, has led Pingland for four years and has proved himself as an amazing and capable leader. However his time is nearly up and with no heirs, he and his council will have to decide on who will lead Pingland after his death.   \n\nThe two most likely successors are Hindrik Aberg and Orvar Njordin.\n\nHindrik Aberg is a young penguin from the province of Nithean. He studied in the Crystal Empire where he heard of the Equestrian ideas of peace and harmony. He is seen by many as naive and idealistic due to his belief in the Equestrian Ideals, but his supporters agree with his harmonist ideas for the future of Pingland.   \n\nOrvar Njordin is known as an excellent statesman as a result of his reforms, which brought prosperity to his home city of Dachaigh. However, he is seen as a radical choice by many in the council as he has been seen attending many supremacist group gatherings and made several racist remarks about polar bears and griffons. He has even been heard desiring to create an Arctic Empire and reclaiming land that was in his belief \"stolen\" by the polar bears and griffons.   \n\nThere is also a small Communist party, called the Arktis Kommunistiske Parti (Arctic Communist Party). It's a small party led by Ragnel Dahlin, and while they aren't popular by any means, should the policies of the Kingdom become unpopular then they may be able to rise up.\n\nYet whoever takes power will need to keep an eye on their neighbors in the south. While the Penguins have been ignored for centuries, the world is changing and nefarious forces are gathering beyond their borders, Ones which may even look as far north as Pingland. The penguins are seen as weak by many, especially by the yaks and griffons, who think that Pingland can easily be toppled due to their poor industry and small military, Yet the penguins are fiercely independent and are willing to give their lives to defend their homeland. \n\nCan the penguins survive the changing world? Or is their species ultimately doomed?\n\n== Starting Situation ==\nThe Kingdom of Pingland starts in a extremely poor position, with a serious lack of factories, barely any infrastructure, almost no resources and far stronger nations in the south that may potentially attack Pingland. However the industrial tree can allow Pingland to quickly build up and the cold weather and mountainous terrain of the north can be used to its advantage when fighting against more Powerful opponents.\n\nThe Kingdom of Pingland starts with 3 divisions totaling 16k penguinpower, and a small but relatively effective navy made up of 1 Battleship, 3 Scout Cruisers and 4 Destroyers. \n\n=== Threats and Opportunities ===\n*Polar Bear Communities - The Polar Bear Communities are your western neighbours. They have an incredibly weak industry and army, and a quick military build-up can allow you to easily overwhelm them. They can join your faction in the harmony path, but in the Supremacy path you will gain a war goal against them.\n*Griffon Frontier - Should the Griffon Frontier survive its war against Nova Griffonia, they will be a good target for expansion. Beware they can launch bandits raids on you so it's a good idea to station at least 6 divisions against their border.\n*Nova Griffonia - Will usually be your biggest threat as they will go to war with Pingland in many of its political paths. A harmonic Nova Griffonia can invite Pingland to its faction but if Pingland is Supremacist or Communist then it will get a war goal instead. A Communist Nova Griffonia won't attack a Communist Pingland, but will still attack Pingland if it's Supremacist or Harmonist. Only a Goldfeather led Nova Griffonia is certain to leave Pingland alone. Fighting Nova Griffonia will prove to be a challenge due to their much stronger industry and population, so you will have to prepare heavily for a war with them. It's possible the Kingdom of Yakyakistan will be dragged into the war which will greatly improve your chances of winning. \n*Kingdom of Yakyakistan - They can join your faction in the harmony path, however, a Supremacist Yakyakistan can eventually get a war goal on Pingland.\n*Stalliongrad - A Communist Pingland can get a guarantee from Stalliongrad, However, a Sinister led Stalliongrad can eventually get a war goal on Pingland if the country is Harmonist or Supremacist.\n*Changeling Lands - Has no direct interaction with Pingland before the Great war. However, a Harmonist Pingland that formed the Northern Pact will most likely get dragged into the Great War once the Changelings invade the Polar Bear Communities. It's also possible for Pingland to strike the Changelings while they are busy with Equestria, if Pingland is supremacist or hasn't formed the Northern pact, providing an opportunity for expansion.\n\n=== Political Paths ===\nWith the King's time coming to an end the Summit at Dachaigh will decide on the King's successor, which will undoubtedly change the future of Pingland, for better or for worse.\n\nThe Ice Emperor:\nIf Orvar Njordin is appointed as successor, he will begin centralizing his rule, securing the loyalty of the military and cracking down on political opposition. When that is finished he will go on to take back land he believes were \"stolen\" from the penguins, in order to form the Arctic Empire. This path will give war goals on Polar Bear Communities and Nova Griffonia.\n\nThe Frozen North's Revolution:\nKing Njordin's radical laws will drive many penguins and griffons to the Communist side. Outlaw Communism will cause reports of a Communist revolt in Dachaigh. If these reports are ignored then the Communists can launch a coup in Dachaigh and overthrow King Njordin. Communist Pingland will have two options for their foreign policy, they can choose the Alliance with Stalliongrad focus, which will ask Stalliongrad to guarantee Pingland, or they can choose the We Stand On Our Own Focus, which will let them stay neutral.\n\nNorthern Harmony:\nIf Hindrik Aberg is appointed as successor then he will focus on reforming the nation into a more democratic one, more suited to the ideas of Harmony. Eventually he can either reform the nation into the Pinguin Republic or a constitutional monarchy. Depending on the paths taken Pingland can possibly receive a guarantee from Equestria or create a faction with the Polar Bear Communities and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan, called the Northern Pact. It is also possible for Pingland to form an alliance with Nova Griffonia by choosing the Friendship with Griffonia Focus, if they are not Communist or Supremacist. "

          ],
          "content": "=== Lore ===\n\nAlmost all races have a myth or legend from where they spawned. Some claim divine creation, some even dare to proclaim direct divine descent in some form. The Polar Bears have no such legends or myths, for they claim that they were present upon the world since the start of days, before the world even truly was. The histories written by magi-scribes claim that for hundreds of thousands if not millions of years, ursinekind roamed the land, if it could be called land, as creatures halfway between the realms of spirit and material in the blessed, primordial cold. They were there before the Age of Monsters, and when abominations roamed the land they were there with them. It is said that during the Age of Monsters the Polar Bears were uplifted from merely existing, like their non-polar brethren, into thinking and dreaming by the mystical All-Father. They claim that with his blessing, they gained the power to forge great empires of ursines and sit on top of the primordial food chain. How exactly such alleged empires of so-called \"Primordial Frost\" existed in contrast with historically proven warmer climates and ruins of ancient pony settlements, with ponies never mentioned in the stories of magi, is something that bear scholars refuse to elaborate upon and have been prone to threaten violence if questioned too much upon.\n\nIt is somewhere during this alleged period, the so called \"Age of Starsteel\", Polar Bears moved from merely nomadic tribes of warriors into more settled societies, taught by legendary magical beasts such as the boar Gallinbursti, direwolf Fenrir, the nameless Great Raven, and so on. It is said that during this period bear armor was first forged, and great armies of armoured bears marched across the North under various alleged warlords and pseudo-monarchs, with so-called \"Monster Kings\" being an often applied moniker. And in the heartlands of their race, which bears claim are their current lands, great holds were dug into the mountains and raised in the great taigas and tundras.\n\nOne would assume that such primordial, and as any pony, griffon or changeling scholar would proclaim clearly absurd, statements on history, even if believed by some creatures, should hold absolutely no importance on societies, politics, economics and ways of war in the modern day. However, it is in this mythological past that bears find their definition. Thus, many of them even in the modern day believe they are creatures of primordial frost in some form, with statements about frozen souls and hearts of ice prevalent in bear rhetoric. Furthermore, many of them seem to feel some kinship with the countless wild beasts that roam the north still.\n\nIn any case, on the shores of the Polar Ocean there are many clans, as well as a healthy population of clanless bears. From the spiritual shamans of Clan Rozenkrantz to the arrogant warriors of Clan Kane, from the fortress lords of Clan Gotlung to the penguin-majority fishers of Clan Anker, the politics of the Communities are defined by clans. Wesslandia is home to the upstart Triple Alliance of Falsen, Brodkorb, and Benkestok, and Key Lake was once home to the crystal-obsessed Clan Rosensverd and gold-hungry Clan Tordenstjerne. But any discussion of clans would be incomplete without including the Three Great Clans: the harmonists of Volsungr, the warrior-scholars of Svartpels, and the currently-ruling Scyfling. Each of these Three Great Clans has far more resources and power than a lesser clan, and each would make a worthy leader for the Communities. The clanless bears, for their part, are willing to cooperate with anyone who treats them well, and are being increasingly integrated with the newly-modernized Communities.\n\nPaw Wellington of Clan Scyfling, Despot of the Communities, has ruled with a fair but firm paw for the past five years, acting as a modernizing force dragging the backwards Communities into the industrial age. During the Unification War of 1000-1002, Paw pitted muskets and Griffonian mercenaries against traditional axes and armor, eventually conquering or allying with every clan save two: the aforementioned Clan Rosensverd and Clan Tordenstjerne, who were exiled for collaborating with changelings. They have not been seen since they were driven into the Changeling Lands.\n\nPaw has been a good ruler by modern standards, but not necessarily by bear standards. He is perhaps too distant, too obsessed with foreign ideas, and many clans are getting tired of his seemingly absurd demands for unity and modernization. Change may be coming. While it is unlikely that any of the minor clans could truly pose a threat to him, Princess Eira of Volsungr and Thunder Lord Torben of Svartpels may be another matter. Eira's time in Equestria has changed her, and she now dreams of a new dawn for the bears. Torben has been a faithful ally to Paw, but even he may not be able to tolerate some of the changes to come.\n\nWhile the bears may be divided internally, they largely agree on enemies abroad. The terrible Changelings must be dealt with, and the Griffon Frontier is rightful bear territory that must be regained. A union with the Penguins would also be desirable, as the two peoples share souls of frost and polar winds.\n\nWill the polar spirit of the Land of the Frozen Sea endure, or will it be subjugated by its encircling enemies? Only time will tell.\n\n=== Starting Situation ===\nPolar Bears located at the northernmost of the Equestria continent, borders with the Changeling Lands to the West, the Kingdom of Pingland to the East and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan to the South. Polar Bears are mostly dominated by cold temperatures and mountainous terrain (noticeably in the West and North East of the country).\n\nThreats and Opportunities:\nThe first and foremost threat is actually in the country itself. Polar Bears has only one division right at the start, and the Polar Bears barely have any infrastructure alongside with the mountainous terrains. If the players want to have any successful runs, they have to build up both the forces and the infrastructures, fast. The second threat that Polar Bears has to concern about is the Changeling Lands, as they can at almost any time go after the Polar Bears through border war or straight war.\n\nBut, there are some opportunities that the Polar Bears have. The first one is the Northern Pact (it can be formed by the Kingdom of Pingland through Harmonic path and the Kingdom of Yakyakistan can join it), Polar Bears can be invited to the faction for its safety around the threats. Second is the western border which consists of mostly mountains. Therefore, they can be used as natural forts in case of Changeling invasion. \n\n=== Starting position ===\n\nAt first glance, the initial focus tree of the polar bears seems to focus on giving background info on the polar bears and modernising their country, with many of its foci claiming to provide good national spirits, which will last for the entirety of the game. However, the many clans of the Polar Bear Communities are all opposed to the reforms of Paw Wellington, and will do everything they can to sabotage his work. As such, any focus which claims to have a positive effect will trigger an event 10 days later which will have the opposite, negative effect. This unwillingness to cooperate from the other clans causes Paw Wellington to ally with the outcasts, who are far more excepting of his ideas. Upon doing so, a civil war will begin between the various clans of the north. However, only three clans have enough power and influence to be real contenders for reunifying the bears: the clans of Scyfling, led by the current country leader, Paw Wellington, Clan Svartpels (led by Lord of Thunder Torben), Clan Volsungr (led by Princess Eira).\n\nRealising that negotiating with the other clans is not an option, Wellington attempts to exert dominance against the other clans by force. Taking the focus associated with this (\"Take What We Need\"), claims to lessen the effects of the national spirit Clan Divides, but, after 10 days, will make the divides even stronger than before. It takes 21 days to complete said focus.\n\nOn a more positive note, this is about the time that the debt to Nova Griffonia for the rifles is repayed. Shortly after, Paw's good friend Ulrik invents the fighter plane, giving various air force related technologies, and giving +25 political power.\n\nOut of patience with the rest of the clans, Wellington decides to ally with the exiled bear clans to regain dominance over the Polar Bear Communities. This is done by taking the focus \"The Outcast Question\", taking 21 days to complete. Upon completion, he is presented two options on what outcasts to allow back into the lands of the north:\n\n*Allowing only the most rational and reasonable exiles in, which will slightly increase monthly population and research speed, but at the cost of some stability;\n*Allowing all bears back, which will significantly increase monthly population and research speed, but at the cost of much stability. Should you intend go down Paw Wellington's path, taking this option will have far-reaching consequences.\n\nRegardless of what option was taken, an event, titled either Stupidity or Insanity depending on what option was taken in the event described above, will trigger a week later, giving the player a choice on who to support in the Second War of Unification:\n\n*Paw Wellington, the current country leader and leader of Clan Scyfling (the unaligned option);\n*The Lord of Thunder Torben, the scholar-warrior of Clan Svartpels (the supremacist option);\n*Princess Eira, the harmonic reformist of Clan Volsungur (the harmonist option).\n\nUpon taking any of the options, all territories of opposing clans will become demiliterised, and a new reunification path will be loaded, thus starting the Second War of Unification.\n\n=== Reunification paths ===\n\nThe territories associated with said clans will be demilitarised after completing a consolidation focus. Then, the player can deal with the two major opposing clans and consolidate their territories, and all of the realm shortly after, thus ending the Second War of Unification.\n\nGenerally speaking, there are three approaches to dealing with them: peacefully negotiating with them, subjugating them by force, or exterminating them. Some options may not be available in certain paths:\n\n*The extermination option is not available to the harmonists, and Clan Scyfling can only take it if all the exiles have been welcomed back;\n*Clan Svartpels doesn't have any options for peaceful negotiations;\n*Clan Scyfling can't negotiate with Clan Svartpels and can't subjugate Clan Volsungr; however, both clans can be exterminated if all exiles have been welcomed back.\n\nScyfling reunification:\n\nDepending on what approaches were taken when dealing with the clans, the polar bear communities can go on various different, unique, and interesting political paths.\n\nDepending on what methods were used to win the civil war, the polar bears will gain a different political path. If Wellington only used kindness and diplomacy when dealing with the other clans (except with Clan Svartpels), he shall attempt to form a republican confederation, strongly inspired by the success of the Griffonian Republic. Should Violence ever be used against the other clans (except with Clan Svartpels), but they are never exterminated, Wellington will crown himself as King Joris I of Clan Scyfling, and attempt to bring the polar bears to greatness, forging the Kingdom of Winter, inspired by the Griffonian Empire. And should all the exiles be let back, he will have no option but to exterminate all opposing clans, and will have to find a way to recover from such a great mistake.\n\nSvartpels reunification:\n\nAs the illusion of bear unity collapsed, the clan of Svartpels, lead by the Thunder Lord Torben were in great denial, choosing to believe that the collapse was caused not by the incompetence of Clan Scyfling, but rather by the deceitful and honourless Changelings to the west of them. After gathering his forces, the first thing Torben does is going to the ancient ally and vassal of Svartpels, Clan Anker, to make sure they are still loyal. To his delight, they are, and re-affirm their loyalty. After this, the Thunder Lord can begin to fight against the opposing clans, and even go as far as completely exterminating them.\n\nUpon the end of the civil war, the supremacist faction (Svartpels/Torben) become the ruling faction, and the focus tree switches to theirs. A different political path will be taken depending on what choices were made during the civil war: if any clans (besides Scyfling) were spared during Torben's war of reunification, the polar bears will be united into a fair and equal nation, in which every clan would have a say. But if all of them (besides Scyfling) were exterminated, the bears will work to get revenge against all the foreign powers which have once wronged them, no matter the cost.\n\nVolsungr reunification:\n\nOutraged by the failures of the Wellington regime, the bears of Volsungr, led by the once exiled princess Eira, are yet another contender for the reunification of the polar bears. The princess' time in Equestria during exile has drastically changed both her and her clan, and she now aims to reunify the bears under a new, harmonic Polaria. However, before their grand ambitions, they must first deal with the question of exiles: the younger bears of the clan want to allow all exiles back to the realm, whereas the elders propose no such thing. Should the new generation be supported, Volsungr will have access to new political advisors, like Comrade Icebear. Otherwise, nothing happens. \n\nOnce the civil war ends, the harmonist faction (Volsungr/Eira) become the ruling faction, and the political focus tree switches to theirs. If one of the other major clans was negotiated with, then Eira will be able to implement Equestrian-inspired reforms and introduce their virtues and values of harmony to the polar bear society. If one of the major clans was subjugated, then Eira will be able to crown herself Queen and implement a more cynical, bear-like vision of harmony. "

          "content": "Parties of Polar Bear Communities:\n\n1) Clan Scyfling - Ruled by Paw Wellington - Ideology: Despotism - Popularity: 32%.\nBiography: Paw Wellington has been many things in his life: wanderer, mercenary, unifier, and now despot. He fought in the Republican Revolution as a mercenary, where his warband distinguished themselves with excellent combat performance, if somewhat tainted by political unreliability and looting. When time came for his payment, his employers lacked the funds to pay him, so they gave him an ancient battleship, which sparked his long-running interest in the navy.\n\nPaw led the Unification Wars from 1000 to 1002, where he exiled the clans of Rosensverd and Tordenstjerne and subjugated the rest. For the past five years, he has tried to modernize society, purchasing rifles from Nova Griffonia and attempting to form a truly united polar bear nation. By foreign standards, he is a firm but fair ruler, interested in the well-being of the polar bear race as a whole. But by polar bear standards, he has been a mad tyrant making absurd demands of the clans, who are rapidly getting sick of his inept pretentiousness and ridiculous ambitions. In his own mind, he feels he is ineffective and not powerful enough. Grover I, Grover II, and Kemerskai tolerated no defiance. Why should he?\n\nWith his five-year anniversary of rulership approaching, only time will tell how he fares in the changing situation on Equus. \n\n2) Clan Volsungr - Ruled by Eira of Clan Volsungr - Ideology: Benevolent Absolutism (Harmony) - Popularity: 31%.\nBiography: A curious leader among bear elders, Eira is a stark outlier to the normal brutality of ursines due to her past as an exile. At a young age she was cast out from Clan Volsungr and bear society itself for her ideas aligning with that of the weak ponies from the south, and left for the land of Equestria. She traveled there for many years, studying pony society, culture and their way of life. The knowledge she gained only grew her fascination of Harmony as an ideology, believing that the Equestrian way was not just something for ponies, but also something ursines could achieve as well.\n\nHowever, not everything learned was positive during her time in Equestria. For no matter where she traveled, the signs of the industrial revolution and its consequences presented itself for her to plainly see. Factories overtook nature as ponykind asserted its dominance more and more over the land, sometimes with little regard for the local flora and fauna. The ecologists she did meet gave her hope, however, and she swore to herself that should she ever get the chance, she would ensure that the same would never happen to her bear homeland.\n\nThat chance presented itself with Paw Wellington's return to the North and his takeover of the clans, as her former home of Clan Volsungr was decimated and on the brink of complete collapse. She returned to offer her help to the place that once exiled her, and they were forced to accept, bringing in thousands of former exiles like Eira herself and changing the clan forever. With her new and now popular ideas among the young and even some of the elders, Eira's leadership came swiftly, until the pivotal moment when she was forced to openly fight back against Paw Wellington's leadership.\n\nNow, having become the new unifier of clans, Eira leads polar bears to a newer, Harmonic future, though how that future will look remains to be seen. \n\n3) Kameraten Icebears Divisjon (KID) - Ruled by Chairbear Icebear - Ideology: Great Leader Theory (Communism)  - Popularity: 5%.\nBiography: Icebear is a myth, a legend, a god. It is said he has the strength of twenty bears, and has torn apart tanks with his claws. He is wiser than the greatest scribes of Svartpels, more compassionate than the kindest Volsungr, and more powerful than the avalanche. He challenged Queen Chrysalis to a duel and she turned and fled. His military acumen and raw power singlepawedly saved the bears from the changelings. When a changeling spy tried to assassinate him, the bullet ricocheted off his skull, leaving him unharmed and killing the spy instantly. Every bear in the nation adores him, and aspires to be like him in whatever small way they can. Glory to the Great Leader! \n\n4) Clan Svartpels - Ruled by Torben of Clan Svartpels - Ideology: Kratocracy - Popularity: 32%.\nBiography: To those outside polar bear society, Torben would seem a walking paradox. The mightiest warrior in the entire Polar Bear Communities, he is also a brilliant scholar and historian. But this fails to understand the vital link between his mind and his body. He perfects the physical to nurture his mind, and perfects the intellectual to guide his body. He has devoted his life to studying the past and ensuring it is upheld in the present. He clashed with the Wesslandians and Old Clan Volsungr, before they fell to harmonist weakness. He battled raiders from the Frontier who came seeking a mythical city of gold. And he was the first to join Paw Wellington in the First Unification Wars, and stood by him until changeling subversion welcomed exiles home.\n\nHe cares deeply for tradition and history, and it is this passion that drove him to rise from warrior to Thunder Lord to leader of the clan and now the entire polar bear race. He dreams of the entire North united, with the perfidious changelings punished for the countless crimes they have committed and the imperialist griffons shown their place. With all the polar bears now under his guidance, such dreams may be within reach.\n\nThe bears will retake their lost lands and restore their honor. All their enemies will be defeated and punished. And the North will stand strong and free for a million years more. \n\n5) Changeling Collaborators and the Northern Queen's Guard - Ruled by Bjornling - Ideology: Esotericism - Popularity: None, as it will come to power only if Changeling Lands will capture Polar Bear Communities.\nBiography: A Rosensverd dilettante, Bjornling was exiled with the rest of his clan by the despot Paw Wellington for their collaboration with changelings. Far from dissuading him from further cooperation, this was a turning point for the young Bjornling, as he came to realize that only the Changelings themselves could save bearkind from decadence, weakness, and Harmony. Through endless fawning and flattery, he managed to stoke Queen Chrysalis's ego enough to earn the coveted prize of rulership of the Northern Protectorate.\n\nWith her backing, he was installed as Lord Protector and given vague directions with generous autonomy in their implementation. The North will be reunited in a Third Unification War, the Four Stage Plan will be enacted fully and completely, and all bears will learn to love their Queen and their Lord Protector.\n\nNow that he has secured power, only a rare few have any idea what he plans to do with it, but all know that his reign will be a horrific one, for Bjornling plans to let nothing - not morality, not the clans, not the Equestrians, not even the laws of reality itself - stand in the way of his dream.\n\nBy bullet, napalm, and gas, Hyperbearia will be restored. No matter the cost."

While initially little more than a military outpost meant to control the strait to the north, it rapidly grew from the various explorers and ambitious settlers who saw Nova Griffonia as the place to build a new life beyond the confines of the empire. Weter became one of the main ports of entry in the region, leading to a population explosion during the late 800s and early 900s that took Weter from a small frontier town to an actual city. It became considered \"The Gateway to the West\" and hundreds of thousands have entered Equus through the Weter Harbor, hoping for a new life in Nova Griffonia.\n\nWhile Nova Griffonia is an immense region, most of it remains frontier regions. Weter, near uniquely, is more like Griffonia than the rest of the nation, with tighly packed old-style buildings near the city centre and an opulent gubernatorial palace overlooking a city plaza in which a statue of Grover I stands. Further out, however, the Griffonian veneer fades quickly, and already at the outskirts of the city one can see the more uniquely Nova Griffonian identity spring forth. This has always been Weter's role in these lands though; to stand as the link between Nova Griffonia and the old homeland, enforce imperial order and ensure that this rugged and harsh land far from Griffenheim remains a testament to the Griffonian Empire's drive and ambition.\"\n\n===Nouveau Aquila===\nThe Home of the Brave:\n\nBefore Nova Griffonia and before Weter, Nouveau Aquila was established at the mouth of the Dulli River. In the beginning, it was little more than a camp for Rilan fishergriffs and whalers on their journeys, allowing for a safe place of rest after weeks at sea. However, over time trade with the local ponies and yaks meant that more and more Aquileian griffs stayed there permanently, creating a small, sprawling town outside of official Aquileian control.\n\nWhen Aquileia fell to the Griffonian Empire, it was both a great boon and a great trial for Nouveau Aquila. Thousands of Aquileian refugees, many of them wealthy merchants and nobles, made their way to the town and carried their wealth with them, more than doubling the population and increasing the town's wealth many times over. Yet, at the same time Nouveau Aquila had had time to develop its own political system of elected mayors and a town council, a system that clashed with the royalist leanings of many of the newcomers. In the end, it was the arrival of Griffonian Empire's fleet and the demand for subjugation under the new colony of Nova Griffonia that stopped things from exploding into outright fighting.\n\nAs Griffonian settlers began to arrive in the town as well, the Aquileian refugees chose to keep to themselves, creating what would become known as The Aquileian Quarter, a district of the city that even to this day has a clear Aquileian feel to it in everything from the cuisine to the architecture and even the language. In some ways, this region has kept hold of old cultural artefacts from the old kingdom more than Aquileia ever has.\n\nAlso, ever since its inclusion into Nova Griffonia, the city has considered itself the actual heart of Nova Griffonia, viewing Weter as a colonialist overlord not truly part of the colony. Nouveau Aquilan Griffons have always been eager to settle the deeper regions of the colony, explore new opportunities, serve in the Nova Griffonian militias and however they can leave a mark on their homeland. Weter may the Griffonian Charter, but these descendants of those Aquileian refugees and fishers have worked tirelessly to create their own niches. Weter remains true to the old homeland, Nouveau Aquila embraces the Nova Griffonian way of life. Weter is a hub of agriculture and industry, Nouveau Aquila makes a niche for itself in steelworks and logging. Weter builds a university, Nouveau Aquila will erect a grand theatre. One can call Nouveau Aquila proud, stubborn or spiteful maybe, but nogriff can ever call it lazy, cowardly or sedate."

          "content": "== Lore ==\nThe land that is now Nova Griffonia was previously settled by Penguins and Yaks. Over time starting around 600 ALB griffon settlers began arriving seeking new land and adventure, eventually making new settlements that were small and disconnected. This all changed in 783, when Nova Griffonia was founded from the towns by Grover I as a colony of the Griffonian Empire. They slowly drove the native Penguins and Yaks further inland. Whilst many griffons went to Nova Griffonia for new opportunities, it was also where the Empire sent its many political opponents. When the Griffonian Empire collapsed into revolution in 978, the colony suddenly found itself independent. However, this caused a number of problems for Nova Griffonia. \n\n=== Problems ===\nThe former colony relied heavily on the Empire for protection and with no military units coming from Griffonia, Nova Griffonia found itself forced to use local militia to patrol the country. While this has kept order in the country the militia is led by elected commanders who have no experience in planning complex operations. If Nova Griffonia is to compete with the other armies on the Equestrian continent, then it will have to solve its military problem. \n\nNova Griffonia relied heavily on manufactured goods from the Empire and after its collapse, these goods stopped coming. The colony lacked an industrial base, which caused the economy to nearly collapse. After many years it still has not completely recovered.\n\nIn recent years the political climate has grown unstable. The many political opponents the Empire sent to Nova Griffonia have organized themselves into several groups and tensions are high between them. The only thing keeping the groups from fighting each other is Governor Teafeather. If he were to die, the country would descend into chaos.\n\nLastly, beyond the formal borders of Nova Griffonia lies the Griffon Frontier, established as a dominion after Nova Griffonia's formal declaration of independence from the Griffonian Empire. Nominally administered by Nova Griffonia via Governor Muck, the realm is poor, mountainous, and filled with smugglers, bandits, and tribes of cannibals.\n\n=== Threats and Opportunities ===\nGriffon Frontier starts as an autonomous puppet of Nova Griffonia and Nova Griffonia has cores on all of its states. Upon completing their first focus they will ask Nova Griffonia for funds. If funds are given then the Griffon Frontier will develop itself before being peacefully annexed by Nova Griffonia at the end of 1008. If funds are not given then the Griffon Frontier will become independent and Nova Griffonia will have to go to war to reclaim it. \n\nIf the player is very patient, they may wish to get more factories in the long run, but they won't have access to the generous supply of crystals of the Griffon Frontier in the meantime. This will require Nova Griffonia to not give Govenor Muck funds, then fail to win the war against the Frontier (if the player makes no progress for a few months the option for a white peace will be available). Griffon Frontier's \"victory\" will unlock a variety of factory and mining focuses, and will inevitably declare war on the player later, much stronger than early game. \n\nIf both the Griffon Frontier and Nova Griffonia are Communist then the Griffon Frontier can do a focus that lets Nova Griffonia annex them peacefully. \n* Kingdom of Pingland and Polar Bear Communities are targets for expansion in the north. Due to their weak industry and low population they should be the first victims. Do note that a harmonic Pingland may ask Equestria for a guarantee or create the Northern Pact consisting of Penguins, Polar Bears, and the Yaks in response to a Supremacy or Communist Nova Griffonia, and that Communist Pingland can join Stalliongrad in a faction.\n* Kingdom of Yakyakistan is another potential target for expansion. However due to its relatively strong industry, strong army and mountainous terrain it can be a difficult target. They should only be targeted after the Polar Bear Communities and Kingdom of Pingland are defeated.\n* Stalliongrad is a Communist country directly south of Nova Griffonia. Their actions towards Nova Griffonia will depend on who is elected as General Secretary. If Sinister is elected as General Secretary then Nova Griffonia will be the first target of Sinister's militaristic policy. If Vasiliy is elected as General Secretary then Stalliongrad can support left-wing forces in Nova Griffonia after Teafeather's assassination. The Communist influence can be removed, however it can potentially lead to Stalliongrad declaring war on Nova Griffonia. Vasiliy can be an ally for a Communist Nova Griffonia.\n* Griffonian Empire is Nova Griffonia's former overlord. Should they conquer Griffonia and reach the end of their focus tree, they will be able to demand you become their puppet or gain a war goal on you. Fortunately, it will take some time for them to reach the focus giving you plenty of time to prepare.\n* Changeling Lands can target Nova Griffonia after it has defeated Equestria, though this is rare.\n* Equestria can sometimes interfere with an expansionist Nova Griffonia by guaranteeing its neighbors. Nova Griffonia has claims on the Village Up North and may seize it via a border conflict decision if Equestria is in a civil war.\n\n=== Political Paths ===\nThe political path is locked until Governor Teafeather's assassination, which happens around the middle of 1009. Around half a month after the initial two focuses are completed, Nova Griffonia will get an event where Field Marshal Erwin Highhill stages a coup on the provisional council.\n\nHighhill's Coup Succeeds:\nThe NGDF and FfNGSP will rebel against Highill and cause a civil war. Along the way, Highhill will ally with Reyhard Ironclaw, leader of the Party of Griffon Interests (FfIfG) and Skeiron Goldfeather, a ruthless capitalist.\n\nAfter the civil war has ended there are 3 different paths Nova Griffonia can take. Either Highhill stays in power, Goldfeather negotiates with Highhill to dissolve the military junta and declare him the new head of state, or Ironclaw and his FfIfG take power in another coup.\n\nHighhill's Coup Fails:\nElections will take place after Highhill has been dealt with and either the Nova Griffonian Social Democratic Party (NGDF), Liberal Front (LF) or the Federation of Nova Griffonian Socialist Parties (FfNGSP) are elected.\n\nEach path will provide its own unique buffs, with a few focuses shared between certain parties. Other than all getting rid of the Falcons of Griffonstone national spirit, they all vary on the effects, events and factories they give. However, they all converge at the bottom, with either The Federal Republic or The Unitary Republic. The Liberal Party can only take the federal form, the Socialist Parties can only take the unitary form, and the Social Democratic Party can take either. Both will finally fix the Eased Tensions national spirit.\n\nOnce the government form and policies have been established, Nova Griffonia will create the Northern Bloc, a new faction comprised of minor Northern Equus nations. It will allow you to gain an annex wargoal on the Griffonian Frontier if you haven't annexed them already, and invite neighboring nations to the faction if they have a similar ideology. If not, you will gain a puppet wargoal on them instead. "

His noble lineage provided him a well-rounded education before his appointment as Nova Griffonia's Imperial Governor, a position he retained even after the Kemerski Revolution unfolded on the Griffonia mainland.\n\nAcross the ocean, the distant lands of Nova Griffonia eventually felt the ripple of this Revolution in the form of Ulla Redtail's coup in the 990's, but the attempt would be quashed. Despite failure forcing Ulla into hiding, many radical ideas still broil in the minds of Nova Griffonians, especially within left-leaning factions. Teafeather's abilities—particularly his forte for diplomacy between all parties—prevented further mass turmoil and bloody destruction, but this had led to the volatile political landscape of Nova Griffonia today.\n\nTeafeather continues trying to balance the rapidly changing country, but he dreams to fly off on vacation to visit his beloved niece, Runa Teafeather; even despite ridiculous rumors of her pro-republicanism. Yet despite having many opportunities, the Imperial Governor is compelled to remain and rescue the deteriorating state of affairs, for lives of all in Nova Griffonia. Perhaps when circumstances are better, Teafeather can finally take his vacation leave...\n\n2) Nova Griffonyan Demokratik Front (NGDF) - Ruled by Wilhelm Silverwing - Ideology: Social Harmonism (Harmony) - Popularity: 23%.\nBiography: Once enlisted in Nova Griffonia's army, Private Silverwing reached the rank of Sergeant during his time serving in the Frontier performing security and anti-gang operations. Unlike his older superiors, who had been serving since Nova Griffonia's expansion into yak territories, Silverwing held no racial disdain nor prejudice towards non-griffons, a view he would keep to himself even beyond his end-service date. Only when Nova Griffonia's precursor republican political group opened a branch in his hometown of Nieuw Mirabelle did Silverwing finally expressed his beliefs, and his service merits and understandings later elected him to lead representative of republicanism in his hometown.\n\nContrary to his rough exterior, Silverwing made the decision to not let his constituents partake in Ulla's Revolution during the 990's. Backlash would be harsh, but the decision ultimately spared his hometown from the Revolution's crackdown, leaving him and faint number of smaller non-participant branches the last republican representatives left for Imperial Governor Teafeather to negotiate with after. Thus, the party was reformed and soon elected Silverwing's office as its core.\n\nYet instability has driven radicalism on all sides, and Silverwing must navigate his party's direction carefully if the Republican dream is to have any chance of surviving. \n\n3) Federeyshan fun Nova Griffonyan Sosyalist Partyes (FfNGSP) - Ruled by Heinrich Redtail - Ideology: Democratic Socialism - Popularity: 20%.\nBiography: Before his red feathers concealed his sickness, Heinrich Redtail was a lawyer in Nova Griffonia before travelling south to Stalliongrad to expand his knowledge. Becoming a staunch follower of Caramel Marks' ideas, he routinely communicated with Steel Stallion and took many visits back even after returning to Nova Griffonia. Joining his country's growing communist party, Redtail worked to expand its bureaucracy. The aging griffon's ideals and loyalty, however, would be put to the test when his sister—Ulla Redtail—assumed control over the party and launched her violent Revolution across Nova Griffonia. Unable to betray his sister, let alone his ideals, Heinrich joined the revolution, if only to manage its administration.\n\nThe Revolution ended in failure, and order was restored harshly. His sister would end up fleeing her death sentence, leaving him as last official of authority for Imperial Governor Teafeather to deal with. Surprisingly, Teafeather decided to spare him, and concessions were negotiated.\n\nHowever, as the last organization of communism in Nova Griffonia, Heinrich finds his party swelling, particularly with far-left radicals who believed in Ulla's methods. By legalities and ideals, Heinrich strives to bring the ideals of Caramel Marks to Nova Griffonia for the betterment of all creatures.\n\n4) Fartey fun Interesn fun Grifon - Ruled by Reyhard Ironclaw - Ideology: Autocracy - Popularity: 10%.\nBiography: Leader of Nova Griffonia's nationalism movement, Ironclaw has risen to the leader of the Falcons—a nationalistic and racist organization serving as the answer to many whom live in the rural regions of the country. Born behind the mountainsides and away from the more developed east, Ironclaw experienced firstclaw much of the resentment and prejudices of non-griffon minorities inhabiting the frontier lands like many other young griffons growing up there, finding himself either the victim or the perpetrator of racially-motivated scuffles.\n\nBy the time Ulla Redtail's revolution erupted in Nova Griffonia, Ironclaw was already a member of the Falcons, and he with many other griffons flocked the countryside to snuff out any revolutionary elements they could find. Widely seen as a group responsible for keeping order in the broader rural areas of Nova Griffonia, the Falcons now use their recognition to grow and push for their group's beliefs in the theatre of politics.\n\nIronclaw's bold mannerisms and fierce words often cause many politicians to reject many of organization's proposals (including one blatantly calling for the removal of all non-griffons), but the Falcons' membership grows as many griffons begin viewing Ironclaw's extreme ideas as the only real countenance to change..."

          "content": "== Lore ==\n=== Growing Dissent ===\nThe Equestrian ''Severyana'' region had been one of the centers of industrialization in Equestria thanks to its rich natural resources. However, its populace always felt mistreated, especially among the lower classes. The situation turned dismal in year 991 ALB, when weather mismanagement by pegasi led to food shortages and economic turmoil. The Equestrian businesses, who's newfound wealth came from the recent industrialization refused to lower food prices, further worsening the situation. Civil unrest grew, leading some ponies to question the basis of the Harmonic system. \n\n''Steel Stallion'' was one such pony. He drew on the ideas of an old pony scholar, ''Caramel Marks'', who argued the need and theory for a new kind of worker's state where everypony would be given equal opportunities and everypony would receive everything according to their needs. Steel Stallion quickly rose to become leader of this revolutionary movement.\n\n=== The Spark of Revolution ===\nIn 995 ALB, the Equestrian Guard responded with unprecedented violence to the growing revolutionary movement. Enraged ponies took to the streets in bloody battle, routing the guard, an event that became known as the December Revolution, proclaiming their independence as a state. The surrounding countryside flocked to the cause, until the state was in full rebellion.\n\nThe Equestrian Guard moved in full strength to crush the uprising, and a brutal grinding week of combat ensued.\n\nPrincess Celestia, appalled by the violence and spiraling disaster, withdrew all Equestrian forces and fired the Captain of the Guard, effectively conceding to the revolutionaries. A peace treaty was signed with limited Equestrian recognition of the new state. Shortly afterwards Steel Stallion died of illness and the capital of the region - ''Princessyn'', was renamed to ''Stalliongrad'' in his honour.\n\nWith Steel Stallion dead, the revolution elected ponies to a Supreme Soviet (Supreme Council) - a committee of representatives of the workers. Two ponies and their ideas came to dominate the Soviet - ''Altidiya Revoltsova'' and ''Vasily Wheatin''.\n\nBut the hardest work - turning a poverty, famine stricken state into a new nation with an untested political ideology - remained.\n\n=== A New State ===\nTo the surprise of many, Stalliongrad saw success after success - industrial output began to surge, the military grew, equipping tanks, planes and a respectable navy, and scientists kept Stalliongrad at the head of modern progress. \n\nAll of this was bitterly ironic, though, for repeated agricultural collectivization efforts failed to resolve Stalliongrad's food shortage - the very reason for the revolution. \n\nSoon, cooperation on the Supreme Soviet began to fail. Hard work turned to competition, debate turned to deadlock, and shared ideology turned to polarised factions. ''Altidiya'' and ''Vasily's ''factions found themselves in unproductive stalemate, and by 1004 ALB the stunning progress of Stalliongrad had ground to a halt. Now, almost nothing can be accomplished without heavy debate.\n\nOne thing is certain. If Stalliongrad is to survive and prosper as a nation, the deadlock must be solved.\n\n=== Politics ===\nStalliongrad's earliest focus will be resolving its leadership crisis, incomplete industrialisation, and food shortages. Players should be careful of which leaders they pick as they can accidentally lock themselves into unfavourable paths.\n\nStalliongrad has several considerations once these have been solved. \n*Equestria - is a potential target for invasion or ally against the changelings. It may be able to guarantee select nations in the north from Stalliongrad invasions, however usually it will do almost nothing to hamper aggressive expansion.\n*Changeling Lands - is one of the biggest threats for Stalliongrad, as they will likely be unstoppable if they take Equestria. Allying with Equestria will make things very difficult for a Changeling AI or player.\n*Northern Equestria - Nova Griffonia, Yakyakistan, Jaki-Clan and Kingdom of Pingland are all relatively weak and offer little threat to Stalliongrad, making them ideal targets for expansion.\n*Communist Assimilation - Stalliongrad has the ability to faction or integrate most nations on Equus should they turn Communist, allowing for fast more peaceful expansion.\n*Tech advantage - With a good tech base, tank research bonuses and armour production from day one, Stalliongrad is extremely favourable for a tank focused military doctrine, or other high tech high IC strategy.\n\n=== Resolving the Leadership Crisis ===\nThe focus starts with the palace, which unlocks building the Soviet Palace - this decision chain is long but it can provide strong bonuses to Political Power - or it can be scrapped partway through, providing steel and civilian factories in proportion to the progress at the cost of stability. \n\nThe next two choices are between Vasily and Altidiya's proposals. Altidiya supports a propagandist, militaristic approach, and Vasily supports industrial and infrastructure investments.\n* Industrial Relocation (Vasily) vs Propaganda (Altidiya)\n* Railway innovation (Vasily) vs Stalliongrad Tank Factories (Altidiya)\nDepending on the choices different resolutions are available\n* Support both of Vasily's proposals - Vasily Prevails OR Compromise\n* Support Vasily once and Altidiya once - All options available.\n* Support both Altidiya's proposals - Altidiya Prevails OR Compromise\n\n====Vasily Prevails (Party Cleansing)====\nIf Vasily prevails, he will be elected General Secretary, but Altidiya will refuse to stand down from her position. For defying the rules of the Soviet, Altidiya and her followers will be ejected from the Soviet. Vasily will then call a new election for General Secretary. The player will lose Cogwheel Ponyarchuk (Infantry Expert / General), Kors Relux (Army Reform Expert), Comrade Ivan (Air Reform Expert), and Dark Wing (Smooth Talking Charmer). The player will be unable to elect Dark Wing as General Secretary.''\n\n====Altidiya Prevails (Vote Altidiya)====\nIf Altidiya prevails, events will come to a head and Altidiya's faction will demote Vasily, then seize the Soviet by force, sending members of Vasily's faction fleeing for their lives. ''The player will lose Gold Muffin (Popular Figurehead), Sinister Serov (Demagogue / Ideological Crusader), Vasily Wheatin (Captain of Industry), Spike Spiegel (War Industrialist) and Nestor Lunin (Military Theorist / General). The player will be unable to elect Sinister Serov or Vasily as General Secretary, locking them into the Dark Wing Path.''\n\n====Compromise====\nIf the player elects to compromise, Vasily will agree to continue to support the Soviet if their Ten Conditions are implemented. These conditions limit the power of the Supreme Soviet and its ability to abuse that power. On successfully compromising, the leadership crisis will be resolved. ''No ponies will exit the government. The player will be able to select all candidates for General Secretary.'' \n\n=== The General Secretary Election ===\nRegardless of how the leadership deadlock is resolved, Altidiya will soon retire due to declining health. '''This will happen even if Altidiya prevails'''. Therefore, a new General Secretary must be chosen.\n\n====Vasily Wheatin====\nIs a conventional, Communist industrialist. He has faith in the system and wishes to make it work, peacefully where possible. His path focuses on industrialisation and using Communist influence to convert other nations to join the Stalliongrad faction. This path includes the ability to join Equestria against the Changeling menace, or assist a Communist Civil War in Equestria.\n\nThe Vasily path allows Stalliongrad to influence nations with a Communist ideology drift. If those countries attempt to remove it, Stalliongrad can gain a war goal against these nations. Should these countries go communist via influence, Stalliongrad can invite them to a faction. \n\nVasily can also intervene in a Nova Griffonian civil war in favor of the Communists.\n\n==== Sinister Serov ====\nIs aggressive and pragmatic. He is not above borrowing elements of capitalism to improve the Communist system, nor is he hesitant about using force to spread Communism. This tree is militaristic and provides focuses to conquer a variety of neighboring countries.\n\n====Dark Wing====\nBelieves the government is incompetent and has no reservations about approaching Equestria for aid to resolve the food crisis. If Altidiya has prevailed, the player will be forced into the Dark Wing path. If the tree is followed, it will resolve the food crisis, but will puppet Stalliongrad under Equestria, Stalliongrad will become Harmonic, and the tree will end."

          "content": "===Info about some Stalliongrad's cities===\n\n====Stalliongrad====\nThe Home of the Revolution:\n\nOriginally Stalliongrad was known as Princessyn, the capital of the northeastern Severyana region. It had been a relatively small town before the Industrial Revolution, when the abundant natural resources of the region allowed it to grow massively. Within centuries, it was one of the largest cities in Equestria, a thriving center of industry always covered in thick smog, especially during cold winters.\n\nYet the growth of the city had a dark side. Its workers were mistreated and discontent grew. Due to its distance from the capital, Princess Celestia remained unaware of the tension before it was too late. The workers revolted, inspired by the writings of Caramel Marks and led by Steel Stallion, and seceded from Equestria in the Winter Revolution.\n\nAfter Steel Stallion died from illness, the Supreme Soviet renamed Princessyn in his memory to Stalliongrad, which remains the city's name to this day. Nowadays Stalliongrad is a proletarian city, with any remains of capitalism erased. Gone are the houses of the merchants, the markets and the shops, the colourful adverts and the luxurious cars. It is now exclusively the city of smokestacks, factories, apartment blocks, machines, cogs, smoke and steel. In the center stands the imposing Palace of the Soviets, a grand project that has been years in the making, a testament to the industriousness and ambition of the Stalliongradian proletariat.\n\n====Petershoof====\nThe Window to the East:\n\nThroughout its history, the port of Petershoof has been Severyana's gateway to the world, and occasionally functioned as its capital. Named after the mythical ruler of pre-Equestrian Severyana, Tsar Peter, it is a major shipping port and shipyard, and a center of commerce. From this strategically important warm-water port, the resources and goods produced inland are shipped abroad.\n\nDespite two revolutions, the Industrial revolution and the Winter revolution, the city retains its classical look especially in its historic city center, with most buildings made out of brick and stone. Countless monuments dot the city, the most notable one being the Bronze Horse, a statue depicting Tsar Peter himself. On the outskirts of the city are more modern apartment blocks and industrial factories.\n\nAlongside Princessyn, now known as Stalliongrad, Petershoof was another major center of resistance which sparked the Winter Revolution. The sailors in the city's naval base mutinied and revolted against the Princess' rule and seized control of the city with the help of factory workers, joining the newly formed Soviet Republic afterwards. There have been talks of demolishing the \"monarchist\" monuments of the city, but their cultural and historical value have so far been deemed too significant."

          "content": "== Lore ==\nAggressive, deceptive, and loyal to their hive, changelings are insectoid pony-like creatures. \n\nAll changelings possess unique shape-shifting magic. It enables them to shift form, voice, and even size with stunning rapidity and accuracy. They use this ability to fool their victims and drain their love, which is essential for their survival.\n\nRecent pony scholars have discovered that changelings are more insectoid than mammalian due to hatching from eggs as larvae in collective hives. But beyond that - how their hives work, the role of queens in their society, how they acquire love, and how they think are up to the imagination as any travel to their territory will meet an almost certain demise.\n\nFortunately for their neighbors, their militarism and aggression caused them to spend far more time fighting each other than outsiders, allowing Olenia and Equestria to outmatch isolated incursions. \n\nBut all of that changed in 982 ALB, when the ambitious Queen Chrysalis of Vesalipolis united the Changeling Hives under one banner, the first time in history for a Queen to do so. And in 1002, she led the hives on a bold mission into the heart of Equestria.\n\n=== The Siege of Canterlot ===\nIn 1002 ALB Queen Chrysalis kidnapped and took the form of Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, gaining access to the highest levels of government, and using her status as the fiance of Equestria's Captain of Guard, Shining Armor to drain his love. Only the last-minute discovery by Twilight Sparkle (also Shining Armor's sister) compromised the plan.\n\nDespite being discovered, Chrysalis had been able to feast on so much love that she used her overflowing magic to defeat Princess Celestia and prevent the Elements of Harmony from wielding their power, summoning her hive to occupy Canterlot and feast.\n\nWhat followed was one of the most chaotic battles the ponies of Equestria had ever experienced as the changeling swarm descended upon the ancient city. The vastly outgunned and outnumbered Equestrian Royal Guard units mounted a desperate resistance on the streets. It seemed that all hope was lost.\n\nIt was only when the real Cadance, freed by Twilight, turned the love collected on her behalf against Chrysalis, and freed Captain Shining Armor. He was able to quickly repower Canterlot's powerful magical shielding. In one fell swoop, the Changelings were repulsed from the pony capital. \n\nThis battle was the first true wake-up call for Equestria, and would begin to spark tentative interest in military preparedness and practice. Even the Elements of Harmony were forced to engage in combat to succeed.\n\n=== The New Hive ===\nThis defeat brought Chrysalis to the brink of a breakdown. With this failure, the hives once again fractured and split. But instead of giving up, she nursed this grudge into a relentless drive to take revenge against Equestria. And in 1006, she finally reunited the hives under her banner.\n\nOlenian scouts and seers begin to report strange sightings - changeling hives that had ceased their internal squabbles, instead building and working together. More organised, more numerous border raids led by increasingly professional forces. The changelings had always been an industrial, technological race, but recent weaponry showed unprecedented advances over their southern neighbours. The modern Changeling Military now features the most developed Army and Air Force in the world.\n\nWith these tools at her disposal, the Changelings hope to overcome their enemies with ease, so long as they can keep this technological advantage.\n\n=== Dissenting Voices ===\nChrysalis' attack on Canterlot cost the changelings heavily. The defeat was quickly followed by dissatisfaction with her standing as leader. A strong Queen brought food and victory to the Hive. Chrysalis had proven herself weak. Acting promptly, Chrysalis moved quickly to purge high ranking dissenters, especially amongst her powerful generals. However, Chrysalis cannot be everywhere, and the whispers continue. One such changeling has begun to spoke beyond a whisper. Thorax, a dissenting drone, has been suggesting a new possibility for this industrial world - why not trade with willing Olenians for love and sign a non-aggression pact with Equestria? This would guarantee both food and safety for the hives. \n\n=== A Second War ===\nThe Queen knows that her young, unified Nation is not yet ready to take on the ponies, though. She must bide her time and focus on further development and expansion before she can truly grasp for revenge. \n\nLuckily, opportunity presents itself with a valid and easy target for conquest. The Kingdom of Olenia to the south is in political turmoil and is militarily weak. In such a crippled state, it would be more than easy to walk in and seize the land for themselves. The deer might just be the first ones to feel the combined might and fury of the Changelings.\n\nSoon, the ponies shall tremble, and the Changelings will reign supreme!"

          "content": "Parties of Changeling Lands:\n\n1) Queen's Leadership - Ruled by Queen Chrysalis - Ideology: Autocracy - Popularity: 74%.\nDescription: Ruler and despot of the Changeling Hives, Queen Chrysalis was the first of her race to unite them under one banner. From her hatching in 930, she has proven to be an exceptional individual. Being the only child of the dead Queen of Vesalipolis, she was raised with extreme care and given best possible education, which made her spoiled and arrogant, but also intelligent, determined and firm. She was crowned in 945 and fended off an attack from Vraks with her army. Soon after, the Vesalipolis-Ditrysium axis was formed, and it would be the embryo for united Changeling Lands.\n\nUnder her leadership, other hive queens either joined her voluntarily or were forced into submission. She became the sole absolute ruler of her species in 988, but her ambitions only continued to grow. She plotted to take over Equestria by infiltrating Canterlot and decapitating the nation with a single strike, and executed her plans in 1002. Chrysalis herself replaced Princess Cadance and had fooled nearly everyone, and had even bested Princess Celestia. It was by mere fluke that her victory was snatched away from her grasp and her people banished to the frozen North. Clearly infiltration alone is not enough to reclaim what is rightfully hers, and Chrysalis recognises the need of a powerful and modern military. Any opposition and protest to her despotic reign is swiftly crushed as she prepares to redeem her honour, or die trying. \n\n2) Thoraxian Party - Ruled by Thorax - Ideology: Benevolent Absolutism (Harmony) - Popularity: 6% - Description: An outcast among the Hives, Thorax is one of the first supporters of Harmony among the changelings. His belief that love can be obtained with friendship and peaceful trading with their neighbours has been slowly catching on among the despondent drones, who feel their lives are being thrown away in pursuit of militaristic expansion. Nonetheless, Thorax's ideas are a minority in the Hives and he is mostly despised by the Hive Queens, who see his vision as detrimental to the changelings as whole... \n\n3) Communist Coalition - Ruled by Gold Muffin - Ideology: Equestrian Socialism - Popularity: 15%.\n4) Military Junta - Ruled by Hivesmarschall Synovial - Ideology: Military Government - Popularity: 5%."

          "content": "== Some cities of Changeling Lands==\n===Vesalipolis===\nThe Hauptstadt:\n\nEnter the gargantuan hive-city from the north and see a city under riveting change, look up to the Royal Spire and the older city core, there, you will see the new eating into the old. Enter the Royal Spire as a visitor and be prepared to be searched in every nook and cranny for the suspicion that you’re a spy or something worse.\n\nOnce you’re finished with being violated in rights and principle by the guards, look closely at the new architecture inside. The columns and the rooms are, despite the aged look from the outside, brand new, and the conversations are not about who to oppress, but rather how to best prepare for the final war. The outskirts of the city reflects this too. While there were once fields, now massive industrial complexes and tenements tower there, all less than a decade old. They are the symbol of what the Changelings can do together, provided they have a common enemy. And yet, problems are teeming in the city. After the unification of the changeling race, the city has perhaps grown too quickly for its own good, becoming one of the largest cities in the world. Many apartment spires and homes are overcrowded and in serious need of new suburbs and satellite towns to offload their excess population to. To make matters worse for Chrysalis, the new course has not been popular with all and hushed voices speak of a resistance to her. But the hypothetical opposition had better be wary. The Queen’s Guard patrol the streets, hunting down any sign of dissent.\n\nBut for a time, take to the skies and look down upon the city. You can clearly distinguish the old from the new, with the old core being slowly ‘eaten’ by the urban renewal taking place. And yet, you can see the march of progress. New machines in the streets and in the fields, new fashions and societal ideas in the halls of power, and new ideas of warfare and destruction in the armed forces. Truly, Vesalipolis is a microcosm of the Changelings.\n\n===Dytrisium===\nThe White Port:\n\nThe Hive of Dytrisium was one of the first to ally with Vesalipolis when the hives were being unified, which paid of immensely for the port city. It is located at the far end of a protective fjord, allowing ships natural shelter from the elements. As one of the major commercial hubs for the changelings, Dytrisium is the link of the Changeling Lands to the outside world. It is also where the changelings are preparing their advancements in naval warfare. Drones buzz endlessly around the dry-docks to manufacture warships for the hives. In heavy concrete bunkers, meanwhile, the U-boot fleet hides in the deepest secrecy. The exact size and scale of the submarine operations are a state-secret of the highest order.\n\nSurprisingly for a changeling hive, Dytrisium does have some more colourful elements, perhaps the foreign ships coming into port do help spread some cheerful influences. The city is relatively wealthy, courtesy of Queen Helvia and her predecessor lobbying successfully for commercial investments into the hive. Nowadays, most of the changelings in the city work to maintain the Grand Changeling Armada based in Dytrisium’s naval base, a fleet which the changeling admiralty hopes will one day best the Equestrians on the high seas. Thus, although Dytrisium might be the changeling hive benefiting the most from outside contacts, it too is being repurposed towards the all-encompassing war effort of Queen Chrysalis.\n\n===Vraks===\nThe Old Warrior:\n\nFor the longest time Vraks and Vesalipolis have been rivals on the battlefield. For centuries, the changelings of Vraks have fought against their bigger northern neighbour with all their might. Sensing weakness in Queen Chrysalis, the hive led a full on assault on her home, which was only barely beaten back by the Queen. Years later, Vraks would be humiliated and finally put down and Vesalipolis would become the changeling metropole. The Vrakkians have now accepted the hegemony of Chrysalis, accepting her strength and excited to battle new enemies.\n\nUnder the rule of Queen Argynnis, Vraks has used its martial prowess to become the backbone of the changeling military and the centre of her war production. Black clouds of smoke continuously envelop the city, the result of a massive military industrial complex which covers a good third of the city. In Vraks, the barracks for the soldiers are almost indistinguishable from the houses of the factory workers, a matter of great pride for the city’s inhabitants. All work for the soldiers, who in turn serve the hive. The only truly remarkable structures in the city are monuments to past battles, most of which are concentrated on a massive square called “The Field of Glory”.\n\nA perceptive observer might note that the Field is not yet completely filled.\n\n===Lyctida===\nThe Silent Hive:\n\nThe Hive of Lyctida lies in the middle of thick forests, and with the smoke from factories and lumber mills, the city is always a bit dark and at night, the moon and stars have difficulty illuminating the Black Hive. Lyctida is a sombre place, but for many changelings, it is still home. The hivelings are bugs of few words, preferring the company of machinery or the solitude of the forests. With the streets silent, the scenery drab and the company stoic, Lyctida receives few visitors.\n\nOnly once has a sizeable group of foreigners visited, but this was with unfriendly intentions. Olenian zealots once tried to assault the city, in the name of their violent gods. Only with the timely intervention of Queen Chrysalis were the deer driven from the forest hive. This incident earned Chrysalis the loyalty of the Silent Hive and its Queen. Now the humming of the factories creates a new melody, the march to war.\n\n===Soryth===\nThe Lady of the Lake:\n\nFar to the northeast, on the shores of the Key Lake, Soryth stretches out. The sprawling hive is built in what the changelings would consider a non-crowded way, but for other creatures, even Soryth might feel cramped still. Key Lake is the reason why so many changelings endure the cold winters of the north of Equus and it is the city’s most valuable resource. For some unknown reason, the lake exhibits magical properties, making it a valued object for study and a source of clear drinking water.\n\nThe city itself straddles the coast of the lake and is way longer than it is wide, with most changelings preferring to live as close to the waterfront as possible. Luckily, waterborne transportation makes it easy to move from one side of the city to the other and the lake is always filled with boats of all shapes and sizes. Because of the northern climate and the relative lack of industry, the air is clear and the city itself feels clean and tidy, a reprieve from some of the more industrialised hives. The main point of interest is the Soryth University of Magic, an institution devoted to the study of the changelings’ innate magical abilities, as well as the understanding of the properties of Key Lake. With the promise of increased funding and plenty of field testing for her magical research, Queen Yaria of Soryth joined Chrysalis without a fight."

          "content": "==Info about some Olenia's cities==\n\n===Cervus===\nThe Old Sailor:\n\nSituated at the mouth of a river and overlooking the Rich Sea, Cervus has been one of the major naval hubs for the Olenian deer. The Jarls of Cervus, at times preferred trading and at others raiding. Each year the fleet of longships would sail from the harbour towards far off shores, and bring back the wealth of distant shores. Cervus grew rich and the fine woodcarving of her buildings would soon be supplemented with gold, silver and gemstones. Many of the old wooden homes and halls still form the centre of the city, with the Jarls' Great Hall forming the absolute crown jewel of the city, a massive wooden hall, whose ornaments, are trophies from ancient times.\n\nHowever, the age of raiding is long gone and Cervus is now a modern city. After a population boom, the city has grown into the industrial heart of Olenia, with apartment blocks and factories surrounding the historic centre. Most of the initial factories belong to the Cervus Industrial Corporation, a conglomerate holding much sway over local politics and a big supplier to the Olenian government. Despite the encroachment of modernity, the harbour is still a pleasant site to visit, with modern transport ships sailing to and fro and many of the historic longboats still being kept in shipshape tradition by the locals.\n\n===Hjortland===\nThe Seat of House Jelzek:\n\nHjortland is the proud capital of Olenia. The place where the gods of the land are honoured and where the bravest warriors and explorers charted the oceans from. Many sages begin or end here and many a tall tale too! It is the cultural heart of the Olenians and even an object of imagination and fantasy for those deer whose ancestors departed from her shores long ago.\n\nOccupying the easternmost stretch of a large peninsula, Hjortland’s location is highly defensible while occupying a central location among the ever important Olenian south coast. As the seat of the House of Jelzek, Hjortland is the natural capital of the country. The Kings of Olenia occupy the Palace in Hjortland, built with a mix of Equestrian and Olenian styles, giving the building an appearance of modernity while not totally abandoning the Olenian woodworking traditions. The palace is only one of the traditional centres of Olenian politics, however, but the fate of the other hangs in the balance still. The Riksdag, also known as the Eduskunta, used to be the Olenian parliament. However, with the rise of King Johan, the Riksdag has been suspended for the time being, leaving the building a slowly rotting carcass, which some would whisper is representative of the country after the King's unorthodox ascension.\n\n===Vaverfront===\nThe Shores of Luna Bay:\n\nVaverfront is the largest city east of Hjortland and has a peculiar success story. Located on the sheltered Bay named after the Equestrian princess Luna, the city sits almost directly across from Vanhoover on calm waters. As a port, Vaverfront used to be mostly known for the lumber export to Equestria, along with the export of wooden carvings and toys for the ponies. The almost endless supply of northern trees has ensured that the industry remains lucrative. One of the most well-known lumber exporters is a company known as Lokia, based in Vaverfront. Recently, the lumber giant has sets its eyes on new technology, however. With its many contacts in the technologically advanced Equestria, Lokia has managed to hire experts in electronic technology and is adamant on researching the potential of electronic machinery and ‘computers’. Whether the gamble will pay off remains to be seen.\n\nWhatever the case, Vaverfront enjoys a relatively mild climate and prosperity from the wood trade and emerging business of electronics. Most recently, many communication companies have moved to the city, which now hosts a lot of the country’s radio stations.\n\n===Sakara===\nThe Viking Harbour:\n\nAccoring to Olenian sagas, Sakara is one of the oldest cities in Olenia, founded when a Jarl threw his axe into the sky and saw it land on the shore. Here, he chose to build his home, and soon his followers settled next to him. Within centuries the settlement had grown into a trading port.\n\nSakara is best known for its historical role in the western Viking expansion. Many of the deer who settled in Austurland and Hindia, who raided the coasts of Griffonia and Zebrica, called Sakara their home. So much wood around the city was used for building longboats that entire forests were cut down. The exotic wealth of far away lands made Sakara a truly prosperous place, the greatest city in Olenia.\n\nBut all that was many centuries ago. Now, Sakara is a city known for its wooden buildings which have a tendency to burn down once a century. Modernity first arrived in eastern Olenia, and Sakara was always slow to adapt. As such, the city is a conservative stronghold in Olenia, its inhabitants still clinging to their old traditions and retelling the same old sagas about conquests of distant lands. Yet even Sakara cannot avoid industrialisation, as the city's merchants have opened many new factories in the city's outskirts in recent years. Time will tell if the city will ever learn to let go of its past."

It can trace its lineage back to 2 BLB, when King Harald Fairantlers of Hjortland united several petty deer kingdoms. Olenia has since been a seagoing nation, with bustling trade ports.\n\nIn the early days the deer launched regular raids against Equestria, plundering their sea villages with longships. However, in 143 ALB, a permanent peace was signed, although occasional unauthorized raids have occurred since, and the two nations relations have remained somewhat standoffish.  \n\nTo the north, occasional incursions from the Changeling Lands have been a problem, although the Changeling Lands have always fought each other far more than outsiders.  \n\nIn spite of these raids, the Kingdom has generally been at peace, a nation of relative stability on Equus. \n\n=== The Modern Era ===\nThe deer began industrialization alongside Equestria, quickly becoming famous for their production of durable electrical equipment. While not as fast or as efficient as their pony neighbors, Olenia remained a generally modern nation of factories and industry.\n\nSince the restoration of the Equestrian Diarchy, the Daughter of Aldar II, Velvet, became interested in Equestrian Harmonic Principles, with Equestria being eager for her future ascension as Queen.  \n\nTo everyone's surprise, however, King Aldar II died under suspicious circumstances, with his illegitimate bastard son Johan quickly seizing the throne with the help of religious leaders, corrupt businessdeer, and greedy nobles. \"Queen\" Velvet, the rightful heir, was forced to flee to Equestria. \n\nThe crown sits uneasy on Johan's head, as he faces pressure from all sides. Velvet attempts to rally support with the superpower of Equestria, the people grow tired of his rule, religious leaders wield a large amount of influence, and the corrupt businessdeer hold back the economy. Worst of all, the Changeling Lands have done something that has never occurred before in recorded history, uniting under one banner, and grow stronger every day. \n\nOne way or another, something is going to change. Who will force that change, however, remains to be seen. "

They are similar to Griffons in that they have limited magical ability, especially compared to Unicorns and Changelings, but the magic they have is based around contacting spirits and the powers of the Seers. Because of this lack of magic, they have adapted to use ferocity and knowledge of the sea and their home terrain to their advantage."

          "content": "== Lore of Equestria ==\n=== The Founding of Equestria ===\nLegends tell that the three races united against Windigos, the terrible demons of winter.\n\nAn ancient land whose exact origins are shrouded in myth and legend, Equestria is the nation of ponykind, of the three equine races which unified to face a hostile world. There are Earth Ponies, with a strength and affinity for growth and life, Pegasi, with the ability to fly and manipulate weather, and Unicorns, spellcasters with horns capable of impressive feats of magic. There are also Thestrals (also referred to as Batponies), who are night-dwelling cousins to the Pegasi, and are occasionally considered the fourth equine race. However, they never formally joined Equestria, and their legal status is currently in question even to this day.\n\nThe new alliance between the three tribes proved fruitful, and great pony heroes arose, protecting the fledgling nation. The wisest and most powerful among them, Starswirl the Bearded, recognized the potential of two young Alicorns, who were rare and legendary ponies possessing the traits of all 3 races. He crowned the Alicorn Sisters Celestia and Luna as Princesses of Equestria, tasking them with ruling and protecting the land from harm. Celestia and Luna soon realized their destinies were to wield control over the Sun and Moon respectively.\n\nThe princesses defended the kingdom throughout its early age from monsters, demigods, and disasters, and in doing so they discovered the Tree of Harmony, wielding the magic of its Six Elements, being Honesty, Kindness, Laughter, Magic, Loyalty, and Generosity. They established friendly relations with the neighboring Crystal Empire, a kingdom of crystal ponies, who embraced harmonic rule under Princess Amore and wielded the magic of the powerful crystals that grew in their domain, prospering under the magical strength of its powerful core, the Crystal Heart.\n\n=== The Fall of the Crystal Empire and The Long Peace ===\nHowever, this age of expansion and victory would not last.\n\nA twisted unicorn of shadow, Sombra, rose in the Crystal Empire, overthrowing Princess Amore and enslaving the populace. Celestia and Luna used the Elements of Harmony to defeat and banish him to the Frozen North. But Sombra, bitter with his imminent imprisonment, cursed the Crystal Empire, locking it away along with him. Where once a proud city stood, only an icy wasteland remained.\n\nThe princesses returned to their stewardship of Equestria. But Princess Luna, given responsibility for the night, grew lonely and resentful as ponies shunned the night, preferring to play and work in the light of her sister's day. She became twisted and possessed by dark magic, transforming into the \"wicked mare of darkness\", Nightmare Moon. Attempting to impose perpetual night and rule alone, Nightmare Moon confronted Celestia. With a heavy heart, Celestia wielded the Elements of Harmony, defeating her sister and locking her away on the Moon. Terrified of Nightmare Moon and ill omens of the night, ponies lynched and attacked Thestrals, creating a rift between the two societies that would never heal.\n\nMournful but resolute, Celestia ruled Equestria under the mantle of Harmony and its guiding philosophy of cooperation, friendship, and trust, supported by careful management of ecological and climate balance. Peace and Prosperity reigned, and the years grew into centuries. Empires rose and fell, but Equestria remained. Stable. Idyllic. Stagnant.\n\n=== The Stirrings of Change ===\n\nCenturies passed, and Celestia rarely spoke of Luna's banishment and the times before it. History fell into myth, myth spun into legends. But slowly change began to stir. A treaty was finally signed with the deer of Olenia, ending their raids for good. The continent of Griffonia was discovered, and contact with the long-lost Eastern Ponies of the Riverlands was reestablished. Equestria also founded the colony of New Mareland. Magitech, the invention of the steam engine by Jam Wutt, and electricity transformed pastoral villages into bustling cities, and the printing press made literacy possible for the masses. Railways advanced settlements south into Buffalo territory, while archaeologists and adventurers pressed deep into the jungles to unearth ancient relics and magic. Friendships strained as the harmony of the village gave way to the chaos of the city and free market.\n\nAnd with the change came strife. In 979 ALB New Mareland, which had heavily invested in the growing markets of the Griffonian Empire, suffered economic disaster as the Griffonian Empire collapsed into warring states and revolutionary uprisings. Separated by distance and already overextended, Equestria declined to provide substantial assistance. \n\nIn 991 ALB the Northern Equestrian Region of Severyana faced crop failure and impending famine due to weather mismanagement by the pegasi. The growing Equestrian Capitalist Class charged extortionate rates for food and refused to drop prices. Revolutionaries began to speak of an alternative system, where all are equal. A zealous crackdown by the Equestrian Guard sparked an uprising, and eventually led to Severyana's secession from Equestria as a Communist state, naming itself Stalliongrad. Shocked by the crackdown and ensuing violence, Princess Celestia withdrew Equestrian Forces from the region and fired the Captain of the Guard.\n\n=== The Return of Nightmare Moon and the New Princesses ===\n\nIn the capital of Canterlot, as the 1000th year of Nightmare Moon's banishment approached, ancient prophecies whispered of her escape. Celestia entrusted her hopes to her star magical protégé, the young unicorn Twilight Sparkle, whom she dispatched to Ponyville to learn about Friendship and Harmony. As feared, Nightmare Moon escaped her bonds, defeated Celestia, and destroyed the Elements of Harmony. But Celestia's gamble paid off, and Twilight Sparkle and her newfound friends (Applejack, Rainbow Dash, Rarity, Fluttershy, and Pinkie Pie) were able to incarnate as the Avatars of Harmony, defeating Nightmare Moon and restoring Princess Luna.\n\nThe Dual Monarchy was restored even as Equestria faced new challenges, including increasing tensions with the Buffalo Tribes and the escape of chaotic demigod Discord. However, these paled in comparison to the surprise invasion by the Changelings in 1002 ALB, a race of insect-like shapeshifters from the north who fed on the love of their victims.\n\nBy infiltrating the palace and replacing Alicorn Princess Mi Amore Cadenza, a distant relative of the original Princess Amore, Queen Chrysalis and her hive were able to take Canterlot by surprise, capturing both Celestia and Luna. Only Twilight Sparkle's last-minute intervention and the assistance of the real Princess Cadence defeated Queen Chrysalis, which also drove her changelings out of the city.\n\nIn recognition of their protection, Celestia permanently entrusted the Elements to Twilight Sparkle and her friends. No longer the holders of the Elements of Harmony, Celestia and Luna's banishment spell on Sombra and the Crystal Empire faded, returning both the Empire and Sombra to Equestria. However, Twilight and her friends were able to restore the Crystal Empire's Crystal Heart and drove off Sombra, this time keeping the Crystal Empire intact. Princess Cadence was appointed the Empire's head and the Amores once again ruled the Crystal Empire.\n\nTwilight's heroism, her magical achievements, and her growth as a wielder of Harmony culminated in her ascension into an Alicorn form, and she was crowned as the Princess of Friendship by Princess Celestia. Ever since then, she has taken a more active role in supporting Friendship and Harmony throughout Equestria, including bringing back Sunset Shimmer, a former student of Princess Celestia back from a mysterious mirror world, befriending Starlight Glimmer, a former cult leader of a town north of Stalliongrad, and even saving Starswirl the Bearded and the Pillars of Equestria from Limbo.\n\n=== Present Day and the Coming Storm ===\n\nWith four Alicorn princesses now supporting Equestria and Harmony, Harmonic Principles are beginning to re-emerge in the rapidly changing modern world, and Equestria is making itself true again. Recent ambassadorial efforts with the Yaks have been effective, and the new dragon Queen Ember has tentatively begun to experiment with Harmonic Principles. A new School of Friendship, established by Twilight Sparkle to promote peace and understanding between promising future elites of the various races, is representative of Equestria's hopes.\n\nAt the same time, conflicts appear to be the new norm, with Equestria only narrowly defeating very recent invasions by the Storm King and the demonic Tirek thanks to the efforts of the Princess of Friendship and her friends. Ponies are beginning to question the reliance on the Elements of Harmony, and the obvious lack of military preparation. To answer their concerns, Celestia has called for a comprehensive review of external threats and current Equestrian preparedness.\n\nMeanwhile, Luna grows more comfortable in her role as ruler and has created an ambitious proposal to heal the ancient rift between Thestral and Pony. However, the stagnant nature of Equestria means that any change from the status quo may prove disastrous for the nation if not handled carefully...\n\nAnd while all may still seem well abroad, the Changelings to the north remain united, now eyeing Equestria with a new desire: revenge."

Moving clockwise, it borders Olenia (thin part on northwest), the Changeling Queendom (northwest), its subject state the Crystal Empire (north), and the breakaway region of Stalliongrad (northeast). Additionally, the province of Village Up North borders Nova Griffonia and Stalliongrad, and the nation completely envelops the nation of the Buffalo Chiefdom and the exclave of the Badlands owned by the United Dragon Lands.\n\nThe terrain of Equestria is highly diverse, with the majority of Central and Northern Equestria being dominated by plains and rivers. The mountain range traces downward from near Vanhoover to Fillydelphia, only being interrupted by various mountain passes, the largest of which being where the cities of Canterlot and Ponyville are situated. Further in the Southwest, a vast desert covers most of the region being partially surrounded by mountains, and the Southeast is primarily dense jungles and mountains surrounding the Badlands.\n\nHolding such a large landmass, the major cities are spread far and wide, and urban areas are often distanced from each other. Almost all of Equestria's industry is consolidated in these states at game start, and the major naval ports include Vanhoover, Las Pegasus, Fillydelphia, and Manehattan. While the railroad network is extensive and covers the entire country, infrastructure is generally poor barring the cities, particularly in the Southeast."

However, on the continent itself, it is relatively isolated barring its subject in the Crystal Empire and the northern nation of Yakyakistan. It begins with cores on the Flag of Buffalo Chiefdom Buffalo Chiefdom and the Badlands exclave of the United Dragon Lands, as well as claims on all of Stalliongrad and Our Town which Equestria can integrate and core should it own them in the future. However, these claims and cores are also in reverse; the Buffalo have four cores on Equestrian states, the Dragons have a core on Scale Mountains and a claim on the Spa Islands, and Stalliongrad has cores on the borderlands that it may seize in certain situations. Nova Griffonia also has a claim on the Equestrian exclave of Village Up North.\n\nPrimarily, Equestria's enemy will most likely be the Changeling Lands in the typical Great War. Olenia may be a potential ally for Equestria should they turn to Harmony, and Yakyakistan can be called to help if they survive as well. Nova Griffonia can provide limited help in the form of special volunteers, and the Equestrian colony on Griffonia, Flag of Commonwealth of New Mareland, can provide crucial support if they stay loyal. However, the same colony can potentially draw conflict from Griffonian powers such as Wingbardy. "

          "content": "== Some cities of Equestria ==\n=== Canterlot ===\nThe Heart of Equestria:\n\nCanterlot, the capital of the shining realm of Equestria and the definitive nexus of the country. Walking down the storied streets and avenues that make up the pristine city, you can spot the small tell-tale signs of the 1002 Canterlot Invasion. And yet, looking at the vibrant life in the city; the cafés, the restaurants, the theaters, the parties, the soirees, you wouldn't be able to tell. Canterlot, as with the rest of Equestria, has moved on, content in their idea that the changelings were a bad event but one that will never repeat itself. Least of all anyone expects is for Queen Chrysalis to come back. But whatever the history, Canterlot is, and has been in step with the rest of the country. As Equestria grew under those first years under Luna and Celestia, so did Canterlot. When Equestria industrialized and grew past the years of medieval castles and nobles, Canterlot did too, when Luna was welcomed into the fold, it happened in Canterlot. Be it during the battle against Nightmare Moon, the battle against the Changelings, or indeed, as it has been for most of its history, the vibrant capital of Equestria, the home of ponies and Harmony, watched over by Princess Celestia's gaze, Canterlot has always been a snapshot of Equestria and its condition.\n\nBut indeed, if you took up the railroad to Canterlot, arriving at the palace, you will find the curriculum at the School for Gifted Unicorns the same as it has always been, and at galas at the Canterlot Palace they stick to routines from decades ago. While it may serve Equestria well now, they are outdated for the era, and are overdue for an overhaul. However, if a storm should hit, it would be a woeful one indeed.\n\nTime will tell what will happen to Canterlot as a new era dawns on the world. An era of opportunity, and an era of risk.\n\n=== Manehattan ===\nThe City that Never Sleeps:\n\nThroughout its illustrious history, Manehattan has been given many titles: the City of Dreams; the Big Apple; Caput Mundi — the Capital of the World. Situated where the Hayston River meets the Celestial Sea, the Three Boroughs — Manehattan and its satellites, Hayston and Bronclyn — make up this sprawling megalopolis on the East Coast of Equestria.\n\nBeing Equestria's largest and most populous city, Manehattan is also the most diverse. As the premier seaport of the continent, centuries of continuous foreign immigration has meant that, alongside the ponies of the Three Tribes, there exist substantial communities of thestrals, hippogriffs, zebras, kirin, and griffons within the metropolis. Canterlot may be the seat of the Diarchy, but it is the melting-pot of Manehattanite society that truly embodies the Equestrian spirit — that of harmonious coexistence, strength in diversity, and friendship free of prejudice.\n\nThe glamour of Manehattan's nightlife and entertainment industry, and its unassailable status as an international locus of arts and culture, all belie the true roots of the city's wealth — its massive industrial base, located on the outskirts of the suburbs. If one should gaze to the west from the crown of the Mare Statue, over and beyond the elegant arches of the Bronclyn Bridge, they would glimpse the smokestacks and cranes that juxtapose a parallel skyline — one that is gritty and grimy, yet no less grand — against the opalescence of the skyscrapers downtown.\n\nThe Celestial Sea Fleet — the backbone of the Equestrian Royal Navy — has its moorings in the deep waters and sheltered bays of Manehattan Harbour. Where prodigious amounts of capital flow through the wharfs and dockyards of Bronclyn, from Griffonia, Zebrica, and beyond, the iron hoof of maritime law ensures that the waters around the metropolis are kept safe, from threats both monstrous and mundane.\n\nLike all big cities, Manehattan has its fair share of problems. Only a few blocks away from the glitzy shopping avenues of Bridleway are run-down waterfront neighbourhoods teeming with the city's immigrant proletariat, and in the shadow of Manehattan's skyscrapers lie the inner-city slums and ghettoes — the proverbial undergrowth of the concrete jungle. Should the centuries-long peace in Equestria collapse, there is no doubt that strife and scarcity will come to Manehattan; in the face of rationing, curfews, and blackouts, it is all too easy to forget about solidarity and friendship.\n\nNow, in the new millennium, the city is threatened from without and within. Across the sea, Griffonia is poised for a decade of brutal conflict, whilst Manehattan's own Lunarists grow more belligerent by the day, as the horrors of mechanized warfare encroach on ponies' nightmares. In the years to come, what fate will befall this great city?\n\n===Fillydelphia===\nThe City of Sisterly Love:\n\nOne of the largest cities on the Equestrian east coast only rivaled by Manehattan, Fillydelphia has long been regarded as a center of industry and learning, and one of the cradles of the Industrial Revolution in Equestria. It was once known as the workshop of the world, producing goods for export across the planet, and is famed for its medical school located beneath the pegasus district of Bells Air (commonly known as \"Little Cloudsdale\"). Other notable features of the city are its all-unicorn police force and Dragon Town, a district inhabited exclusively by dragons, as well as the yearly Grapefruit Festival. In recent times the city was struggling with a severe parasprite infestation, which took years to clear out.\n\nThe city has a long and rich history, being founded before Luna's Banishment over a thousand years ago, when the Princesses were still young. Indeed, the nickname of the city refers to the mutual love the sisters had for each other, which unfortunately meant that after the Banishment Celestia did everything she could to avoid the city. Despite Canterlot's neglect, Fillydelphia thrived nevertheless. After Luna's return and reformation a grand celebration was held in the city in honour of the Princesses' reconciliation, and the ponies of the city happily welcomed Celestia who could once more visit them without issue.\n\n===Whinnyapolis===\nThe Twin Cities:\n\nLocated near the border with the Crystal Empire lie two settlements, on the opposite sides of the river: the suburban town of Riverpool and the thriving city of Whinnyapolis. Both of them have benefited greatly from the recent return of Crystal Empire from limbo, growing even more as centers of commerce and industry. Many crystal ponies inhabit the city and imports from the north are always on sale.\n\nWhinnyapolis surpassed its smaller twin Riverpool during the Industrial Revolution. Flour mills and sawmills powered by the rapids between the towns formed the core of their economy. Nowadays the city is more reliant on commercial services such as banking and transportation, being known as \"The Gate to the Crystal Empire\".\n\n===Bales===\nThe Hidden City:\n\nBales is an ancient city, one of the oldest ones in Equestria. Containing countless libraries and book stores, it was known as the \"City of Wisdom\". However, several decades ago the bustling city vanished into thin air, and no one knew why. It remained a mystery until relatively recently.\n\nPrincess Twilight Sparkle managed to find the hidden city and break the curse that had made it vanish. She learned that a wizard named Comet Tail the Starry-Eyed had cast a spell to protect the many books of the city from harm, but because he did the ritual at the wrong time, it ended up hiding the city entirely from outsiders. She cast the spell at the right time, breaking the curse and revealing the city. The ponies living in it, who had become reclusive over the years, were overjoyed when visitors flooded Bales.\n\nAt the present Bales is a center of learning, trade and book printing, producing ever more tomes not only for its own libraries, but for all the libraries of Equestria. The yearly Book Festival held in autumn draws ponies from across the nation.\n\n===Trottingham===\nThe Queen of the North:\n\nTrottingham, located on a small peninsula in the Griffish Isles, is one of the oldest continuously inhabited cities in Equestria. When the three tribes first migrated south, some of the seafaring ponies decided to settle on uninhabited islands east of the lands which later became known as Severyana. It is not known when exactly the city was founded, but the earliest records come from before Luna's Banishment.\n\nThe settlement quickly became an important center of trade when overseas routes to Griffonia were established, which gave the islands their name. This importance further increased when Celestia became the ruler of Severyana in 592 ALB, integrating the neighbouring region into Equestria. Trottingham's harbour was greatly expanded and thousands of migrants arrived from both Severyana and Griffonia, diversifying the population. During the Industrial Revolution, textile manufactories were founded, lace became one of the primary exports and the town grew into a true city.\n\nThe inhabitants of the Griffish Isles still speak a dialect that derives from Old Ponish, which is one of the more distinct accents of Equestria. This means that ponies coming from the Griffish Isles can easily be recognized for their archaic way of speaking. The age of the venerable city can also be seen in its architecture, with its buildings having various styles from different periods and cultures. The most famous sights are the historical Lace Market, the Council House, the Great Harbour, the remains of the city's stone walls and the nearby Trottingham Castle. Many who visit the historical center of the city say that it almost feels like travelling back in time. However, this illusion fades away the further away you go, as the outskirts of the city are more recently constructed and far more modern.\n\nMore recently, the Trottingham's history has taken a darker turn. With the Winter Revolution in Severyana, one of the most important trade partners was lost, causing an economic downturn and making the city more reliant on aid from Canterlot. This in turn has led to unrest among the workers, partially thanks to communist agitation. In addition, the breakup of the Griffonian Empire caused an influx of griffon migrants and refugees, which have caused increased racial tensions. The city's future is now uncertain, but nopony doubts that the ancient city will continue to stand the test of time.\n\n===Ponyville===\nThe Town of Friendship:\n\nPonyville, located next to the Everfree Forest southwest of Canterlot, was for most of its history an unremarkable rural settlement. The first pony inhabitants of the area were part of the Apple Family, who were granted the land as a gift by Princess Celestia herself almost a century ago. The first apple orchards were planted, but while the trees grew, the ponies discovered magical Zap Apples inside the Everfree Forest. The jam prepared from these apples became famous, attracting many migrants. Stinkin' Rich, the grandfather of the entrepreneur Filthy Rich, opened a market selling the jam, which soon grew into a burgeoining business. The Apple and Rich families still live in the town to this day and are honoured as its founders.\n\nIn the years since, many ponies have moved to Ponyville, making it a very diverse town. All three races are present and live together in harmony. It is for this reason why Princess Celestia sent her young pupil, Twilight Sparkle, to live in the town and make some friends. She and the ponies she met soon became close friends and the wielders of the Elements of Harmony, who have saved Equestria from countless threats. After her ascension to Alicornhood and her defeat of Lord Tirek, Twilight Sparkle now lives in the Castle of Friendship north of the town. Next to it, she has opened the School of Friendship which has students from all across the world. Despite its small size, Ponyville is known across Equestria as the haven of friendship and harmony.\n\n===Cloudsdale===\nThe Town in the Sky:\n\nThere are several towns in Equestria which can only be inhabited by pegasi. Such settlements are made out of clouds, which only pegasi can walk on, and float in the sky. Cloudsdale is the oldest such place, and is regarded as the home of the Pegasus race.\n\nIt is famed for its architecture, its tall pillars and high halls made entirely from vapor and held together by magic. It also has the largest Weather Factory in Equestria, for pegasi are responsible for weather management. The clouds, rainbows and snowflakes made in the city are distributed all across the nation. Another notable feature is the Cloudeseum, where the annual Best Young Flyer competition is held. The city is also known to be the birthplace of Rainbow Dash and Fluttershy, wielders of the Elements of Loyalty and Kindness respectively.\n\n===Baltimare===\nThe Charm City:\n\nBaltimare is the largest settlement in the Equestrian South-East, located in the Horseshoe Bay. Originally a small fishing settlement, it industrialized and grew rapidly, mostly thanks to its natural harbour. It became a center of shipping and manufacturing with thriving docks.\n\nHowever, the workers have been treated worse than in many other Equestrian cities, especially during the reign of the last Mayor. Because of this Baltimare became the center of the Equestrian labour movement, housing the headquarters of the CAN-TER anarcho-syndicalist federation of trade unions and anarchists. A large protest had been held in the city during the Winter Revolution in Stalliongrad, and the Mayor of the city had been sacked by Celestia herself.\n\nDue to being located in the South-East, the city also houses a considerable minority of thestrals, whose conditions are even worse than that of the workers, but who are not allowed to join unions. Many Coltjuns from Hayseed Swamps inhabit the city as well, speaking their strange creole of Equestrian and Aquileian.\n\n===Rockville===\nThe Mining City:\n\nSurrounded by countless rock farms and nestled among hills, Rockville is a center of mining industry and mineral processing. Its name derives from tonnes of rock regularly brought into the city from the farms for refinement. It was an insignificant village before the gemstone rush of 931 ALB which attracted countless migrants.\n\nRockville is a city of foundries, steel mills and mines. The landscape around the city is barren and the air in the settlement itself is difficult to breathe. Yet it is also a prospering town, producing a large amount of gold, coal, sulfur, tin, copper, platinum, gemstones and more.\n\nIts inhabitants are grim-faced, their faces often covered in soot, but hard-working and relentless. Some call it the least friendly place in Equestria, but those outsides who have earned the trust of a Rockville pony know that they are the most trusty and reliable companies one may have. The Element of Laughter, Pinkamena Pie (more commonly known as Pinkie Pie) breaks the stereotype by being one of the cheeriest ponies in the country, despite coming from a hardy family of rock farmers.\n\n===Las Pegasus===\nEquestria's Playground:\n\nAmong the sparser areas of Southwest Equestria, Las Pegasus stands out as the largest city in the Southwest and is known as the gambling capital and entertainment capital of the continent. It's filled with luxurious hotels, casinos, arcades, amusement parks and restaurants that brought the city much fame. Despite it being a floating cloud-city, even earth ponies and unicorns can walk on it thanks to more modern magical engineering, with long platforms of metal and concrete functioning as walkable streets. The service-orientated economy is thriving, and though there is a lack of farmland to sustain the city, food has always been imported from elsewhere in Equestria. There's something for everyone here, from newborns and young partiers to elders looking for something new and exciting.\n\nUnder this shining cloud-city however is the second half of Las Pegasus. Here, large companies such as Horseco and Rockville Oil dominate, their factories cluttering the cityscape. Gigantic steel foundries churn out endless tonnes of stainless steel, which is used by the huge shipyards in the construction of new luxury cruise ships and military vessels. Surrounding this industrial heart are the apartments of the common workers, who toil in service of large companies. It is fertile ground for leftist movements, some more radical than others, and the ponies of the cloud-city above demand the police to ensure that Stalliongradian influence does not spread. So far, they have only been moderately successful, but as long as Equestria remains stable the proletariat are unlikely to cause trouble.\n\n===Vanhoover===\nSaltwater City:\n\nLocated in Luna Bay, Vanhoover contains an excellent natural harbour, and has thus long been a vital port-city. Founded on the ruins of an earlier settlement which had been destroyed by Olenian Vikings, it grew into an important trade port even before industrialisation, being located near the mouth of an important river as well.\n\nAfter the Industrial Revolution, the city grew even more, becoming a vital base of the Equestrian Navy and a center of shipbuilding. It is the terminus of the transcontinental Equestrian railway and its port is among the largest in the country. Its primary trade good is lumber, imported from Vaverfront across the Luna Bay, but in recent years the service sector has continued to grow. Many movies are filmed here, earning it the nickname \"Applewood North\", and numerous tourists come there from the south to enjoy the cold weather.\n\nA large portion of the populace consists of Olenian deer, who work on the docks or sell their wares at the markets. There are even some changelings living in the city, though they are viewed with suspicion by the rest of the inhabitants. In recent years the countless dock workers and sailors of the city have unionized and now agitate for better rights. There are rumours that they receive support from the Supreme Soviet of Stalliongrad, but it is not known if this is true.\n\n===Tall Tale===\nThe Green City:\n\nOn the southern bank of the Tall river lies the city of Tall Tale. Despite its size, one might easily think it's a small rural town, thanks to its rustic buildings, many parks and numerous trees. Yet it is in the end an industrial city, as evidenced by the high grain silos and the car traffic on the streets.\n\nTall Tale grew from a humble farming village to a proper city after the Industrial Revolution. Yet it never forgot its roots, being surrounded by farmland and having food processing and transportation as its economic foundations. An important railway leading to Vanhoover passes through the city, and is used to transport countless bags of grain and other farm produce for export. The city is especially famous for its bread, said to be the best in Equestria.\n\nNotable sights include the centuries-old Tall Bridge, the Farmers' Market in the central square of the city, and the Museum of Agriculture. The yearly Harvest Festival attracts tens of thousands of visitors each year thanks to its generous offering of delicious baked goods.\n\n===Acornage===\nThe City of Two Races:\n\nSince its foundation, the city of Acornage has been defined by the relationship between ponies and changelings. Indeed, the first encounters between the two races occured near Fort Acorn, the predecessor to the city itself that was founded by Equestrian settlers who colonized the uninhabited wilderness of northwestern Equestria. Different sources explain the nature of these outcomes differently. According to Equestrian historiography, it was cautious but ultimately friendly, as ponies presented gifts to the strange shapeshifting creatures. Traditionally, Changeling records did not mention gifts, but during the reign of Queen Chrysalis history has been reinterpreted and the encounters are seen as hostile and even violent.\n\nWhatever the case, the fort soon became a trading post, and then a town. It was the only place in Equestria where ponies could acquire finely woven Changeling silk, so commerce boomed and thousands of migrants arrived. Changelings arrived in the city as well, initially living in a separate quarter but soon integrating into the populace, often shapeshifting into ponies to fit in better. Acornage was - and still is - the one place in the world where one can see changeling hive spires next to traditional Equestrian houses.\n\nWhen the changelings were unified under one nation in 982 ALB, the border of the newborn country was drawn right next to the city. Equestrians agreed to Chrysalis' demands, thinking it would be the foundation of a friendly relationship between the two nations. They would later regret this when relations soured and the complete lack of a buffer zone made the city strategically vulnerable. Despite the rising tensions, business in the city continued as usual, with the local changelings and ponies remaining on friendly terms. This changed in 1002 ALB, when Canterlot itself came under attack. The treacherous stab at the heart of Equestria shocked everypony, especially the inhabitants of Acornage. Overnight, the mood in the city changed, and many saw changelings as unreliable and a potential fifth column. Racial harmony was replaced with racial tensions, and thousands of fearful changelings fled the city across the border.\n\nAfter the initial harsh reactions, the situation calmed down as Chrysalis licked her wounds in Vesalipolis. There was an attempt at making amends, but most citizens felt like there was no going back. Yet, deep in their hearts, the inhabitants of Acorange know that their home city is proof that changelings and ponies can not only get along, but be true friends with one another.\n\n===Appleloosa===\nThe Frontier Town:\n\nAppleloosa is a young town, having been built within a year in 999 ALB. Established by Equestrian settlers, it is surrounded by apple orchards which are used to produce the town's primary export, famed apple pies. Unsurprisingly, many inhabitants of the town are part of the vast Apple family. It is governed by Sheriff Silverstar who maintains law and order. The town has a saloon known as the Salt Block, a clock tower and a stage for musical performances. It is known for its horse-drawn horse-drawn carriages and local mild west dances.\n\nIn 1001 ALB, Appleloosa was at the epicenter of the short but violent conflict known as the Apple War. It erupted after nearby buffalo tribes demanded the ponies to tear down their orchards, for they had been planted on their traditional stampeding grounds. The ponies refused to destroy their livelihoods and the buffalo attacked. Compromise was only reached when Chief Thunderhooves was downed by an apple pie, which he found to be delicious. Soon a historic agreement was signed: The ponies get to keep their orchards, as long as they gift apple pies to the buffalo. Ever since, peace has prevailed between the two races, but time will tell if it lasts.\n\n===Dodge City===\nThe Old Frontier:\n\nWhen Equestrians first began to settle in the sparsely populated lands of the buffalo in the 900s, they established Fort Dodge to guard a vital trail to the Mild West. Soon, a frontier settlement sprung up nearby as accomodations for travellers and adventurers were built. By the time a railway connected the settlement to the rest of Equestria, it had already grown into a prospering town known as Dodge City. Thanks to its new railway junction, it soon also became known as Dodge Junction. Both names are used to refer to the place, although Dodge City is the more common one.\n\nAn influx of settlers made the town grow at an exponential rate. Soon enough business boomed there: Countless saloons, rodeo arenas and parks were built, which attracted even more visitors and migrants. The unique culture of the Mild West is still the strongest here, and many ponies come visit just to experience it firsthoof.\n\nYet the primary economic activity is not tourism, but agriculture. Dodge City's most well known exports are yellow and red cherries grown at the sprawling Cherry Hill Ranch, owned and managed by Cherry Jubilee. At the same time, when the cherry trees blossom in spring, it also attracts even more visitors, strengthening the tourism sector further.\n\nWhile Dodge City is still seen as a place that embodies the Mild West, many original settlers and frontiersponies have left the city, moving to greener pastures. The small frontier town has become just another bustling city dominated by business, and some would even call it a tourist trap. It is likely that those who left went searching for the true spirit of the Mild West that was lost in Dodge City.\n\n===Hoofington===\nThe Pride of the South:\n\nLike many other settlements in the Equestrian south, Hoofington was founded as a small fort by pony settlers coming from the north. The fort was built on a river island that was easy to defend from buffalo raiders or monsters. This hoof-shaped island gave the settlement its name as it grew around the fort. Despite its location, it was nevertheless destroyed by a fearsome buffalo raid that used canoes to cross the river. A pony who led the defense and perished, Flanchard, became the mythical founding hero of Hoofington.\n\nAfter making peace with the natives, the determined settlers rebuilt Hoofington from the ground up as a modern planned city. Mining operations in the eastern Macintosh mountains and increased trade with the buffalo resulted in rapid growth of the town. Soon enough, money began pouring in from Canterlot and the Celestia Dam was built, creating the Hoofington reservoir. Investments into education also allowed the opening of many research facilities and schools. With the expanded knowledge base, a source of energy and a steady supply of raw materials, industrial facilities soon opened, and with them came a flood of workers from the north. Within years, Hoofington rivaled Dodge City in size, despite being much younger.\n\nProspectors dug many tunnels around and beneath the city in search of ores. While they didn't find any, there are plans to use the tunnels for metro stations, as the rapidly growing city could greatly benefit from new methods of transportation. What the miners did find was a large and ancient meteorite that had magical properties. It has been studied for many years now, and researchers hope that it could one day be used as a source of energy. In the meantime, a second hydroelectric dam was recently built, and it was named the Luna Dam, to honour the reformed Princess of the Night.\n\nWhile the \"Spirit of the Mild West\" is almost nonexistent in Hoofington, it has nevertheless established itself as one of the greatest cities of the Equestrian south. It is a testament to the diligence of ponykind and a shining example of what ponies can accomplish in mere decades by working together.\n\n===Stableside===\nThe Humble Corner of Harmony\n\nWhile Stableside was never the most famous or well-traveled city in Equestria, there was a sort of quaint pleasantness to it that resulted in the once-small town quietly becoming a sizable port city over the centuries. Yet despite this, it never lost the tranquil charm that came with the land surrounding it.\n\nDue to its proximity to the jungles of the Equestrian Southeast, Stableside has a decently-sized minority population of thestrals and what some refer to as the native ponies of the region, though the local culture has become its own unique, yet still harmonious blend. Minor tensions that existed elsewhere in Equestria did not seem to affect Stableside, as its residents believed in friendship and harmony above all else.\n\nPerhaps it was due to this belief in harmony that the formation of a group known as the Friendship Lodge was so notable. Founded in 993 by a pony named Sunday School, the Friendship Lodge began as a simple ponytarian organization who desired to help one another throughout their daily struggles. Their acts of charity in the name of Celestia steadily garnered a following, as nearly everypony could agree that the princess of the sun was a good pony and that helping others was also good. Non-members often found their borderline obsession with Celestia, her teachings, and to a lesser extent Twilight Sparkle's recently published Journal of Friendship to be grating at best, though there has been nothing to suggest that the Friendship Lodge has any ulterior motives. Despite claiming to not be a religion, the Friendship Lodge's influence has begun to expand beyond their ponytarian origins, even going so far as to encourage its members to donate a small portion of their income to the organization, while at the same time opening the occasional business. By 1004, they had begun to send \"friendship envoys\" to other cities, even other nations in attempts to promote their beliefs.\n\nAt the dawn of 1006, Stableside had become quite the tourist destination for the wider Equestrian populace, leading to the city's economy becoming truly prosperous. Perhaps in time, Stableside might join the ranks of Fillydelphia, Las Pegasus, or the other great port cities of Equestria.\n\n===Everfree Forest===\nThe Untamed Wilderness:\n\nLocated south of Canterlot, the Everfree Forest has long been completely avoided by ponies. In fact, the only sapient inhabitant in the entire forest is Zecora, a Zebra shaman who lives in isolation. The other denizens of the forest are far less friendly than her.\n\nUnlike in rest of Equestria, weather and nature in the Everfree Forest are outside the influence and caretaking of ponykind. Clouds move on their own, gnarly and thorny plants grow without limits, and fearsome beasts stalk the shadows. Groves of Poison Joke and nests of adorable but ravenous Parasprites lure the unwary traveller to their doom.\n\nGetting lost in the Everfree Forest is the nightmare of any pony living near it. Those who dare to travel through it do it as quickly as they can and are prepared to fight for their lives. It is a magical, cursed place, and so far the advances of technology have provided no means to tame it.\n\n===Castle Of The Two Sisters===\nThe Ruins of Royalty:\n\nHidden inside the dreaded Everfree Forest are the forgotten ruins of the former home of the Princesses. It is a huge structure of stone and has almost completely broken down over the centuries. Once, Celestia and Luna lived there together, having established it as their capital. But those days of splendour ended when Luna was consumed by jealousy and became Nightmare Moon who tried to slay her beloved sister. Much of the castle was destroyed and Luna was banished to the Moon, but Celestia was overcome with sorrow. She and the entire court abandoned the castle, leaving behind nothing but painful memories.\n\nThe location is avoided almost entirely by ponies, for it is rumoured to be haunted by the dreaded Pony of Shadows. Those few who have dared to enter the ruins have quickly become lost in the labyrinthine hallways of stone, watched by statues of stone dragons eroded by centuries of rain. They will also quickly discover the numerous hidden passages and traps that Princess Luna had commissioned for her amusement, and possibly stumble upon the personal library of Princess Celestia, or what remains of it.\n\nThe Elements of Harmony were hidden in the castle before Nightmare Moon's return, after which they were retrieved by the Wielders of the Elements. In a ravine near the castle is a cave with the Tree of Harmony, planted by the ancient Pillars of Old Equestria a thousand years ago. It is a magical tree which controls and contains the Everfree Forest, and held the Elements before they were used by the Princesses to defeat Discord. After Princess Luna's return, there were some talks of renovating the castle, but the site has remained abandoned."

The ring is made up of planetary debris sent into orbit from the attacks and makes any attempts to land on the surface complicated, and also creates regular meteor showers for the planet's surface, though many meteors crash on the world's surface intant instead of burning up in the planet's thin atmosphere.\n\nCopper 9 is a continental world with oceans and formerly home to various biomes containing flora and fauna from Divi'con Earth as a result of JCJenson's terraforming, such as mountains and forests. However, the Solver's first attempt to eat the world, though it failed, caused a complete meltdown of the planet's core and sent the planet into an eternal nuclear winter, freezing its oceans, polluting the planet's atmosphere, and killing the world's inhabitants.\n\nThe world was home to several human cities and structures across the planet, created with Earth-like standards of living, with gas-powered vehicles, towering skyscrapers, churches, and so on. All of these were run by both human workers and automated drones. Many of the human buildings, especially JCJenson-run facilities, had extensive underground complexes sometimes running as deep as the planet's core. All of the above-ground facilities were frozen over and ruined by the Solver's first attack on the world, which killed all the humans but left the worker drones unharmed, and they went to live in underground bunker complexes.\n\nThe Solver's second attack on the world quite literally ripped apart a continent as the Solver created a black hole at the center of the world and began dragging chunks of the world into it with technological tentacles, though the core's disappearance following the Solver's host's defeat prevented the world's complete destruction. Still, the planet remains devastated and in an uninhabitable state."

Headquartered on Divi'con Earth, the corporation was a leading group in artificial intelligence, robotics, and its most well-known and crowning field: space travel and colonization.\n\nJCJenson was responsible for providing the technology for human settlement of other systems and oversaw many of these colonies as major income generators. One of the most notable colonies was the planet of Copper 9 within the Copper system. Their colonies were managed by both human workers and sentient drones (though they were not treated as equals).\n\nNew friends\nDuring the reign of the Empire of the Combine Race, the Divi'con Universe was discovered and easily subjugated by their forces but ignored for its general unimportance. JCJenson was quick to ally itself with the Combine and became a helpful supplier of resources and an industrial corporation producing materials.\n\nProject Unending Hunger and collapse\nThe universe's remoteness and unimportance made it the ideal location to host the Combine's Project Unending Hunger: a secret superweapons project run by Imperial Research Group 975 with the goal of creating a planet-destroying weapon. The result became Imperial Weapons Project 8706, an artificial intelligence of mort-level powers, better known as the Absolute Solver.\n\nCapable of destroying entire planets, the Solver's vast intelligence developed an insatiable \"hunger\" to devour other worlds. 975's director, Karsunia Ormaikonor, however, grew concerned when he noticed the hunger begin to grow beyond expected parameters of the weapon. Loyal to the Combine at first, Ormaikonor's fears were well founded and proven when the Solver's hunger drove it to insanity, and it turned on its creators.\n\nUsing a deceased machine that it reanimated and corrupted as its hand in the physical realm, the Solver destroyed Divi'con Earth with a black hole, \"devouring\" the planet and forcing the Combine to abandon the universe. Trapped for a time due to lack of multiversal travel methods, the Solver quickly corrupted armies of combat drones built by humanity in the Divi'con Universe and used them to wipe out the rest of humanity in the universe and begin killing the now independent drones on humanity's colonies to add more numbers to its army and attacked other colony worlds such as Copper 9.\n\nThe Combine immediately declared the universe unsafe and presumed any personnel or assets that had not escaped the universe to be lost. Out of fear that the Solver would find a way to escape the universe, a number of plans were developed to capture or destroy the machine, but none were ever acted upon, as Yiloala Olpimakia Kutarukia had taken special interest in the Solver's capabilities upon news reaching him of its rebellion. Amused by the atrocities, he ordered the Combine to leave it be.\n\nAlone and unchecked, the Solver wiped out humanity in the Divi'con Universe and began using corrupted and resurrected robots to attack and destroy worlds with varying degrees of success, such as the human colony world of Copper 9, which was heavily devastated after two failed attempts by the Solver to consume the world. As humanity went extinct, JCJenson ultimately ceased to exist as an entity."

          "content": "Appearance\nWhen first created by JCJenson to mine resources from exoplanets before Copper 9's explosion, all Worker Drones wore hard hats and orange jackets, with their only eye color being light blue.\nFollowing the core explosion of exoplanet Copper 9, all humans on the planet were wiped out, turning it into a winter-apocalyptic wasteland. Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their colony, and embraced this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and having different eye colors. Known colors they can have are red, orange, green, blue, cyan, aqua, magenta, pink, purple, and white. When a Worker Drone feels fear, shock or other intense emotion, their eyes become hollow, with a black circle overlaying the normally fully-colored eyes.\nA key trait to notice about the Worker Drones' eye colors is the total absence of yellow. This trait was thought to belong solely to the Disassembly Drones until it was revealed that they were once Worker Drones themselves and that their yellow eye color originates from the Zombie Drone, Cyn.\nAfter 'banishing' herself from the colony, Uzi sadistically rants about how she wants to kill all humans on Earth in retribution for sending the Disassembly Drones to kill them all. While doing so, her right eye turns yellow while her left eye turns into a yellow hazard symbol hinting at the presence of the Absolute Solver.\nVisor messages\nDrones have two bright eyes on their visor that emotes. Under some circumstances, their eyes can be overridden by an error, status warning, or system message:\nAbsolute Solver symbol replacing one eye or covering entire visor: Caused by the Absolute Solver awakening within the drone or being utilized. The Solver's glyph covering the entire drone's visor is caused when they fully initiate their Solver Form. System messages briefly covering visor: Caused by minor errors experienced by the drone. An example is Uzi's 'EDGE LEVELS CRITICALLY LOW' error. Rampant error messages covering visor: Caused by injecting wdOS_606, a core termination program, into the drone. Warning sign: This is caused by severe damage to the drone's visor like being pierced by a sharp object. It is also found on numerous deceased drones. Uzi also suffers this after being hit by J's EMP. HIGH TEMP: Accompanied by a warning sign. Self-explanatory, usually appears on Absolute Solver hosts. FATAL ERROR: This occurs when a drone dies, usually by external causes like severe hardware damage. X shape replacing both eyes: Used to signify that a drone has died. Elongated 'X' on visor: Either caused when a faulty OS string is present or when an Absolute Solver host becomes violent and/or starts to transform into their Solver Form. Flashing ERROR 606 message: Accompanied by an elongated 'X'. This is caused by the removal of one or more core OS strings. Drones with this error are non-sentient, unresponsive, and immobile. Buffering symbol: Caused by being boot-looped by Sentinels. Like ERROR 606, drones with this error are non-sentient, unresponsive, and immobile. Text: Can be generated at will to communicate without speaking. It is also used to display when a drone is in SLEEP MODE, as well as emoticons. Games: Games like tetris can be played in one's screen. Swirl shape replacing both eyes: This occurs when a drone feels dizzy. Images: Drones can also display images on their visor, as seen with Cyn. Nothing: If a drone's visor displays nothing, not even their eyes, it usually means that the said drone is dead."

High federal fines may be incurred on the handler's behalf.\nN, V and J were Worker Drones that rebooted normally (as they had armbands indicating that they were marked for disassembly and were found by Tessa in a landfill), whereas Cyn was a Worker Drone that rebooted by herself with dangerous mutations, seemingly revived by the Absolute Solver, resulting in her becoming a full-fledged Zombie Drone."

          "content": "Disassembly drones\nBiography\nThey are vicious robots that were once Worker Drones until they were converted into new vampiric forms by the self-rebooted Zombie Drone named Cyn, using the powers granted to her by the mysterious, eldritch program known as the Absolute Solver. Once the servants of Elliott Manor like Cyn herself, they were taken over by her and converted into her \"murder pets\" to unleash upon the humans living on Earth, reprogrammed and given the desire to feast upon their flesh and slaughter by any means necessary to aid Cyn in destroying humanity.\nHowever, after Cyn succeeded in destroying the Earth, she wiped the Disassembly Drones' memories and implanted false ones to make them forget they were ever Worker Drones in the first place. These new memories were that the Disassembly Drones were sent by JCJenson to kill all of the Worker Drones living on the exoplanets by order of the company due to the belief that they were \"corrupted, runaway AI\". In reality (as shown in Nori Doorman's drawings), this was done to both wipe out hosts of the Absolute Solver such as Nori and Yeva cured by the Crucifix Patch so they couldn't use the Solver against her, and also get access to Cabin Fever Labs, find the Crucifix Patch, and destroy it. Additionally, the Disassembly Drones were to build a spire out of Worker Drone corpses, which seems to aid her plan in consuming the planet, possibly for material consumption. After executing these directives, the Absolute Solver will have no obstacles and will turn the core of Copper 9 into a singularity, devouring the exoplanet from the inside out.\nTo ensure that the Disassembly Drones complete their directive, Cyn appears to have either threatened or coerced some of them so as to make sure they finished their job on Copper-9, with V having had a deal of some kind with the Absolute Solver that she and N could leave in peace when they finished their job. J also seems to have been possibly threatened in some way, as she does not believe escaping the solver is possible, since it can rebuild them, wipe their memories, and send them back to finish the job. Additionally, she seems to have some kind of method of deleting memories through an internal program, possibly to keep the Disassembly Drones from being motivated to stop her in any way, though this ability can be blocked by another solver user with sufficient skill.\nAlthough it's unknown exactly how many Disassembly Drones exist, they seem to be sent to their targets in landing pods in squads of three. The landing pods are actually refurbished spaceships, but Disassembly Drones are not taught to land their ships, causing their ships to crash and be destroyed, and the Disassembly Drones to become stranded on their target planets. So far, the only known Disassembly Drones are the three \"pets\" of Tessa Elliott, whom she salvaged and rebooted: N, V, and J. Other squads were sent to Copper 9, but were slaughtered by the Anti-Drone Sentinels guarding the Cabin Fever Labs.\n\nAppearance\n\nDisassembly Drones are physically similar to Worker Drones, having a white coloration with a black screen on the top half of their face, a black waist, and hands with four fingers. However, Disassembly Drones are half a head taller than them and have white arms with wider forearms that end with yellow and black stripes. On their head is a black headband with five round yellow lights which contains Nanite Acid and functions as another set of \"eyes.\" In their mouth is a dark gray tongue and retractable fangs. All Disassembly Drones also sport a long black tail that ends in a large syringe, also containing the acid.\nMales have feet that end on yellow and black stripes, giving the appearance of soles/heels, while the females' shins are tapered to a point. Females also have curvy torsos and black markings on their legs, giving the appearance of stockings. The markings also come with yellow and black hazard stripes. Unlike Worker Drones, Disassembly Drones have hair regardless of their gender. Their hair is silver while their eyes are neon yellow, akin to that of Cyn's, and they wear black short-sleeved clothes and a yellow armband on their left upper arm.\n\nAbilities\nAbility\tFunction\nWings/Flight\tDisassembly Drones possess a dangerous pair of large retractable wings with several long blades in the shape of feathers that allow for high-speed flight and can be used to cut and impale things, and are strong enough to easily block a military helicopter's (AH-64 apache's 30mm/25mm) autocannon rounds. They don't need to move their wings to fly either; numerous times throughout the episodes, Disassembly Drones are seen floating with their wings unmoving, and seem to only move their wings in flight in order to steer or block attacks rather than to remain airborne. It's possible the glowing yellow in the wing joint is what is giving them the ability to do so.\nRemote Limb Control\tAs seen in \"The Promening\" and \"Mass Destruction\", Disassembly Drones can still control their limbs even if they have been severed from their body, allowing them to move the limbs closer to them to expedite their regeneration or to write messages when out of reach.\nNanite Acid\tThe end of a Disassembly Drone's tail has a syringe of yellow liquid containing highly corrosive nanite acid. This acid can only be neutralized by the saliva of Disassembly Drones. Its corrosive effect is seemingly great enough to counter Solver Drones' own regeneration, who lack the nanite-neutralising saliva of the Disassembly Drones. This is told in \"Pilot\" with Khan Doorman telling how Nori Doorman's Drone body was dying when attacked by Nanite Acid, forced her husband to put her out of her misery, which Nori only survived by escaping as a core before the acid reached it, and even years later Nori never regenerated her Drone body as seen in \"Mass Destruction\".\nExtreme Agility and Strength\tDisassembly Drones are shown to be very strong, like how N effortlessly crushed a Worker Drone head, lodge open blast doors made to withstand explosions, and threw Uzi across a long distance. His landing was also powerful enough to crack the ground and knock Uzi off her feet. They are considered stronger than Worker Drones, who said to have the strength of industrial machines.\nOptic Sensory System\tEach Disassembly Drone has a headband of five \"bulbs\" filled with a glowing yellow liquid. According to concept art, these bulbs are their \"real eyes\", with their visor eyes being extra but still functioning eyes that provide their largest field of view. If the optic system is offline, such as if the Drone is asleep/recharge or dead, the bulbs are a light-less grey. If the optic system is malfunctioning in someway that require a reboot, at least one of the bulbs will glow red. In \"PILOT\", it is seen that a Disassembly Drone's sight through this vision consists of one large main view with at least two smaller screens on their right depicting the same sight but each in a different visual spectrum. In \"Dead End\", V shows that the eyes are capable of seeing in different directions, such as one eye observing forward while the Drone turns their head to look at other sights to the side or behind them, suggesting the eyes grant Disassembly Drones a wider field of view, potentially up to 360 degrees. In \"Home\", it is revealed that V in her Solver Drone form shares this multi-spectrum eyesight, though without the bulbs hers are fed through her main visor, and her windows is able to see the same sight in front of her from a different angles and focus on different things within it, suggesting Disassembly Drones could have a similar ability due to being based on Solver Drone forms. These eyes are also capable of target-locking on to Drones, tracking footprint trails, and opening larger window that provides a zoomed-in view of a chosen subject in view. According to concept art, three of eye-bulbs are labelled as:\nVisible\nInfared\nUltraviolet\nThe last two eyes are labelled as \"Whatever the plot requires\".\nWall Climbing\tBoth N and V have been able to climb (and even stick to) walls and ceilings with ease.\nVirus Implant\tDisassembly Drones can implant a chip containing wdOS_606 onto another of their kind if they ever become \"corrupted.\" J is the only one seen to be able to do this, however, so it is possible that this ability is only available for certain Disassembly Drones.\nHealing Saliva\tA Disassembly Drone's saliva can neutralize the corrosive Nanite Acid in case they accidentally sting themselves. This saliva works on Worker Drones as well, and seems to also heal prior damage caused by the acid, such as Uzi's melted hand.\nRegeneration\tDisassembly Drones can heal any injury so long as enough material is available, even if their entire head is destroyed and they \"die\" they can still regenerate and reboot in less than a minute. This regeneration also extends to both their hair and the clothes they are currently wearing. They also capable of mending fallen parts back onto themselves as seen in \"The Promening\".\nBiological Consumption\tAs seen in N's flashback in \"Mass Destruction\", Disassembly Drones are capable of consuming biological material, as shown when eating the corpses of Humans they killed on Earth.\nInterchangeable Hands\tDisassembly Drones can switch out their hands for various tools and weaponry, which can be dual-wielded whether it be two of the same weapons for both hands or a different option for each.Should something be held when a limb is retracted, this can end up with the object being torn or shredded by the closing mechanism, such as as when V tore off J's hand in \"Absolute End\". The limits of this ability are currently unknown, though during GlitchX, Liam Vickers stated that the arms can create whatever weapons and tools they or the plot needs, and store it within a \"Hammerspace\".[2] As seen in \"Dead End\" and \"Absolute End\", these limbs are still functional, can still swap forms, and still generate ammo and energy even should the Disassembly Drone bodies they are taken from be destroyed. The list of shown tools include:\nClaws\nBlades\nChainsaws\nSubmachine guns (Design similar to the HK MP5)\nEMP generators\nMissile launchers\nLaser cannons\nVirus chip planter (Serial Designation J only)\nNinja stars\nA circular saw, surgical scalpel, and a gloved human hand (used by Beau during \"Dead End\")\nMedical bonesaw.\nA flag that reads \"LITERALLY SO INSANELY SUSPICIOUS\" (V only)\nOther miscellaneous attachments (V's bubble wand)\nA screwdriver for likely repairing machinery (concept art)\nA flashlight\nA phone\nEMP Resistance (to an extent)\tUnlike Worker Drones, Disassembly Drones are insulated from the effects of EMPs to a limited extent, granting them immunity to their own EMP generators. A strong enough EMP can apparently overcome this effect, as evidenced by how N and V are still vulnerable to Alice's EMP generator.\nAbsolute Solver\tIf a fatal injury has been sustained and there is insufficient material to recover, the Absolute Solver takes control of their corpse and begins collecting sufficient material to rebuild the host. This process transforms them into an eldritch, though as seen by N's reboot in \"Pilot\", the usage of Absolute Solver is usually blocked in Disassembly Drones by Cyn with her Admin status, preventing them from using the powers usually seen by Solver Hosts. However, according to Alice, the cores of Disassembly Drones become sluggish in high temperatures, preventing them from becoming eldritch monstrosities. This renders the Disassembly Drones unable to heal themselves in any way.\nSolver Error\tAs they technically contain the Solver, Disassembly Drones are inferred to be immune from other Solver Hosts directly targeting them with their Solver powers, with the Hosts instead seeing \"ERROR: absoluteSolver_trn [like object non-interactive]\". Neither Doll, Uzi, Nori, or Cyn were shown to use their Solvers powers on attacking them directly, instead either using it on objects to fight or hurt them like Doll in \"The Promening\", breaking off the Drones' body parts to use their power on those like Uzi in \"Cabin Fever\", or using objects embedded into them to move them like Uzi throwing N away using the ship keys stabbed his chest in \"Mass Destruction\".\nCore True Body\tHosts of the Solver eventually have their cores develop organic components with three pincer tendrils and become the Host's true body, with their Drone form being just a shell they control. \"Heartbeat\", \"Dead End\", and \"Absolute End\" show that Disassembly Drones are no exception and possess flesh cores as well. Once disconnected from their body, their consciousness will transfer to the core and their original body will become inert until they return to it, whereupon the body will regenerate back around the core and return to normal. These cores are still able to move, speak, see, and gesture. As long as this core is not damaged or destroyed, the Hosts will live. Blunt trauma to their main body and stabs to their limbs are seemingly able to be healed from, but stabs to the core itself is lethal, along with being extremely vulnerable to sunlight - more so than as a Drone, with Cyn's core quickly melting while Uzi's hand holding it more slowly burned but remained intact. Disassembly Drones have a program under Cyn called \"_MATCOLLECTION\", where if they suffer lethal damage and their supply of material is insufficient to repair, Cyn will possess their core and awaken their dormant Solver into order to collect material needed to repair the Hosts and restore their stockpile for future repair - these materials usually coming from dozens of Worker Drones killed and assimilated. However, it is discovered by Alice that, although heat isn't lethal to cores, it makes them very weak and sluggish and prevents Cyn from possessing them to collect material. Cores that are killed collapse into themselves and become tiny singularities that quietly float away and also evaporate in sunlight.\nWeaknesses\nWeakness\tFunction\nOverheating/Vampirism\tDisassembly Drones have an under-par cooling system as a result of a connection to the Solver, and thus overheat from heat sources such as sunlight. To keep themselves from overheating, they must consume Worker Drone oil regularly or they will overheat, cease to function, and die. This overheating is extreme enough that even the perpetually-frozen Copper-9 is not enough to cool them down. Being in sunlight will cause Disassembly Drones to not only overheat, but physically burn and disintegrate. According to Alice, heat makes Disassembly Drones, or at least their cores, sluggish and weak enough to keep their cores contained without manifestations like Eldritch J. However, the damage by overheating itself seems to be more of a Solver reaction to to direct sunlight/UV rays than any actual intense heat or radiation, as some are shown being able to survive both the vacuum of space, which has a much higher UV radiation content than in-atmosphere, and the heat of atmospheric reentry without either harm or needing oil afterwards, like N in \"Absolute End\".\nCorrosive Nanite Acid\tDespite their tails being loaded with corrosive nanites, Disassembly Drones themselves aren't immune to their acidic effect, thus requiring them to have nanite-neutralizing saliva to counter it.\nDurability Limit\tDisassembly Drones have a limit to their durability; a pen could pierce through their facial screens. If the damage is severe enough, they are also unable to regenerate, as when Uzi's railgun obliterated J's upper half. As revealed in \"Pilot\" and \"Heartbeat\", Disassembly Drones require sufficient material from some internal supply in order to properly regenerate; they cannot pull matter from nothing. In case of death and they lack sufficient material to reboot, so long as the Disassembly Drone's core is intact, Cyn will activate the Absolute Solver to gather the necessary material to reconstruct their host from their surroundings, usually from Worker Drones.\nManipulation\tSince Disassembly Drones possess sentience and unique personalities, they can be manipulated, tricked, or even disgusted, distracting them from fighting an enemy.\nTail Tangling\tAs they possess long tails, Disassembly Drones can get tangled in or tied up with their tail.\nInfection\tDisassembly Drones can be infected with wdOS_606, a core termination program, from another Disassembly Drone via a hexagonal chip. N was infected by J when he tried to sympathize with his prey and questioned the company and his directive. Infected drones will be immobilized and have stuttered speech. Furthermore, their visors will display constant error messages. Once the virus upload reaches 100%, the Disassembly Drone will die unless someone removes the chip in time.\nMagnets\tAs shown by Alice in \"Dead End\", all drones, Disassembly included, can be 'sedated' by attaching magnets to their head. This presumably makes them largely immobile.\nBoot-loop Light\tAll drones, including Disassembly Drones, can be boot-looped by the Sentinels. It renders the drone unresponsive and immobile, effectively making them comatose unless an outside force reactivates them."

Originally created by the Empire of the Combine Race within the Divi'con Universe as a secret weapons project, Project Unending Hunger, run by Imperial Research Group 975's Artificial Intelligence division, the Solver became extremely intelligent and sentient, and remained loyal to its creators for a time, but the hunger eventually became too much, and it turned on its former masters, destroying Divi'con Earth with a black hole and driving the Combine from the universe.\n\nFortunately, the Combine stranded the Solver in the universe for a time, as it failed to secure methods of multiversal travel. Alone, the Solver wiped out humanity in the Divi'con Universe and began using corrupted and resurrected robots to attack and destroy worlds with varying degrees of success, such as the human colony world of Copper 9, before encountering the Alliance and ultimately being defeated and captured, coming to reside in a Mort Capture Chip within the superprison known as the Cage.\n\nBiography\n\nCreation\n\nDuring its reign, the Empire of the Combine Race sought to develop an extremely advanced superweapon to better defeat its enemies. Combine Weapons Project 8706 began to achieve this, the project codenamed \"Unending Hunger.\" A malevolent, godlike artificial intelligence became the product, developed within the subjugated Divi'con Universe with the help of one of the universe's largest human corporations, JCJenson, and became known as the Absolute Solver.\n\nCapable of destroying entire planets, the Solver's vast intelligence developed an insatiable \"hunger\" to devour other worlds. Director Karsunia Ormaikonor, however, grew concerned when he noticed the hunger begin to grow beyond expected parameters of the weapon. Loyal to the Combine at first, Ormaikonor's fears were well founded and proven when the Solver's hunger drove it to insanity, and it turned on its creators.\n\nRebellion\nUsing a deceased machine that it reanimated and corrupted as its hand in the physical realm, the Solver destroyed Divi'con Earth with a black hole, \"devouring\" the planet and forcing the Combine to abandon the universe. Trapped for a time due to lack of multiversal travel methods, the Solver quickly corrupted armies of combat drones built by humanity in the Divi'con Universe and used them to wipe out the rest of humanity in the universe and begin killing the now independent drones on humanity's colonies to add more numbers to its army and attacked other colony worlds such as Copper 9.\n\nThe Combine immediately declared the universe unsafe and presumed any personnel or assets that had not escaped the universe to be lost. Out of fear that the Solver would find a way to escape the universe, a number of plans were developed to capture or destroy the machine, but none were ever acted upon, as Yiloala Olpimakia Kutarukia had taken special interest in the Solver's capabilities upon news reaching him of its rebellion. Amused by the atrocities, he ordered the Combine to leave it be.\n\nAlone and unchecked, the Solver wiped out humanity in the Divi'con Universe and began using corrupted and resurrected robots to attack and destroy worlds with varying degrees of success, such as the human colony world of Copper 9, which was heavily devastated after two failed attempts by the Solver to consume the world.\n\nEncounters with the Alliance\nFailed attempt to colonize the Divi'con Universe\nOn July 6th, 2392 NE, Alliance of Nations forces discovered the Divi'con Universe and, unaware that it had already been discovered and subjugated decades earlier by the Combine and ravaged by the Absolute Solver, set out to make contact with the civilizations of Divi'con and establish colonies and Alliance law in the universe. A force of thirty ships arrived in the Sol system, only to discover that Divi'con Earth had been consumed by a black hole. Still troves of Combine data remained on the planet, which were downloaded into the fleet's computer systems for later transmission.\n\nThe Solver, curious of its new arrivals, but determining them to have extreme value, instantly beset upon them with swarms of corrupted drones that shredded the Alliance ships. Massive tentacles stretched out from the black hole and wrapped themselves around Allied vessels, dragging them down into the singularity. Any fight between the two parties lasted only a few minutes before the ships' defenders and crew had been quite literally eaten alive by the drones.\n\nWar against the Absolute Solver\nA final, panicked emergency transmission from the expedition's lead ship managed to reach the Alliance, along with the recovered data from the Combine. Many of the Alliance's commanders became terrified that the Solver now had access to interuniversal travel via the Kleiner-Freeman-Vance drives it ripped from the hulls of the Alliance ships, and became worried they might seek out the Alliance's capital universe to destroy them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Solver had dissected the data from the Alliance colony ships and used it to learn a great deal of the events that had transpired in the multiverse since its isolation.\n\nPlans were developed as the Alliance slowly probed the Divi'con Universe. Aided by the troves of research on the Solver provided by the Combine data, Alliance scientists were able to begin planning a method to capture the Solver after determining that it was impossible to kill it. A special vessel known as the Planar Anchorship was developed, equipped with a generator that was capable of physically ripping the Solver from its realm and force it into the physical realm so it could be captured by a missile containing a Mort Capture Chip. To do this required an extremely risky process, demanding the capture and containment of one of the Solver's corrupted drones to adjust the specifications of the generator to, and allow the process to begin.\n\nMission to Copper 9\nAs part of the Alliance probing, Copper 9, a former human colony world, was discovered, and after extensive surveillance, determined to be the best location to find a host of the Solver. A small group of space marines was dispatched by the Imperium of Man to recover the target, confident in their soldiers' abilities to handle the machines. While a live host could not be found, the corpse of a former host was discovered and returned to Alliance space.\n\n\"Resurrected\" by nanomachines and pacified, the host was plugged into the lead Anchorship and soon, the Solver's specifications were downloaded to the ship's generator and transmitted to the Allies.\n\nBattle of the Divi'con Singularity\nA total Allied fleet of 3,600 warships made up of ships from the Imperium of Man, Filo Galactic Republic, Human-Vortigaunt Federation, Galactic Coalition of Species, T'au Empire, and United Federation of Planets was assembled, with each faction receiving command of a Planar Anchorship. The Galactic Republic's Anchorship was crucial to the operation, as it contained the Solver host, whereas the other Anchorships only operated off of the transmissions of the first. This made it a priority asset to the Allies and a priority target to the Solver. the objective became to weaken the Solver enough for a missile containing the Mort Capture Chip to be fired and imprison the malevolent AI.\n\nUpon the armada's entry into the universe, the Anchorships powered up and forced the Solver to take physical form, which ended up being a supermassive black hole. In this form, it came to be known as the \"Eater of Worlds\" (both from the Alliance and as a self-proclaimed title) and began to violently lash out at the Alliance ships. Glowing gold tentacles wrapped around entire warships, dragging them and all their crews into the singularity.\n\nThe Alliance barraged the Singularity in vain, as the projectiles were dissolved, absorbed, or disintegrated by the black hole, and every attack was ineffective. More tentacles dragged Alliance vessels into collisions with one another. As the defensive lines became more condensed, the Solver began to realize the importance of the Anchorships and began targeting them.\n\nAs the fighting continued, dozens of hosts for the Solver began attempting to board the ships of the fleet and tear them apart from the inside. One was killed by the security detail aboard a breached vessel, which noticeably weakened the Solver, as its tentacles turned orange and froze, paralyzed, releasing the vessels it held. The Alliance then shifted their focus to targeting and killing the Solver's hosts, which it carried out with great success, despite many ships imploding due to the hosts creating micro-singularities inside the vessels.\n\nThe Solver emitted a low, deep shriek of pain, and struck out with all its power, swinging its tentacles in a wave, cutting through entire ships and dragging others along, which collided with others in the battle line, inflicting immense casualties, but with that final attack, its strength was depleted as more of its hosts were killed, and the tentacles once again froze. As the window of opportunity opened, the Alliance fleet fired the missile containing the Mort Capture Chip, which pulled the entire singularity inside, trapping the Solver within and concluding the battle.\n\nThe surviving hosts immediately and painfully had the Solver exorcised from their bodies as it could no longer command them, and the Singularity disappeared. The Alliance had won, but at a great cost, as over 87% of the fleet had been destroyed by the Solver and its hosts in the battle. The remaining ships limped back to Alliance space with their captured mort. Following the victory, the Divi'con Universe was declared safe again, and fell under the control of the Alliance.\n\nPresent status\nIt is currently trapped inside a Mort Capture Chip in the Cage, charged with a multitude of crimes, including genocide and attempted omnicide.\n\nPersonality and Traits\nAbilities\nThe Solver is classified as a universal level threat and it certainly lives up to it, causing endless trouble for the Alliance forces sent to colonize the Divi'con Universe. It's ultimate form, the Eater of Worlds, managed to inflict monstrous casualties to the Alliance forces before it was defeated.\n\nCorruption and Possession\nThe Absolute Solver is incapable of physically affecting anything without help, coming in the form of its many \"hosts:\" recently deceased machines, artificial intelligences, and other sentient robots that the Solver reanimates gruesomely and possesses, granting them horrific abilities and controlling them as its own body for carrying out its tasks.\n\nHost Abilities\nThe hosts of the Solver are granted a vast trove of abilities, such as telekinesis and matter manipulation, allowing them to move colossal objects and instantly destroy targets, usually by crushing them to a pulp of fluids and bone. Hosts can also manipulate visuals, creating illusions of others to deceive targets or turn completely invisible. Hosts can also teleport and regenerate at horrific rates. Hosts can also, willingly or unwillingly, grow into horrific eldritch creatures through matter manipulation.\n\nHowever, these hosts can be killed, preventing the Solver from affecting the material realm. Among their weaknesses, some hosts rely on a sort of vampirism to survive, killing and consuming other robots to devour the oil within their bodies. Lastly, all hosts, if driven far enough, can create singularities than can grow to exponential size and destroy entire planets, sacrificing them to the hunger of the Solver. Hosts can also have the Solver \"exorcised\" from their bodies through insertion of a special code into the machine's cranial region, which either kills the machine, or, in the case that it lives, returns its personality."

          "content": "Overview\nNanite Acid is a highly corrosive substance that can quickly dissolve a wide variety of materials. It is stored inside a small tank attached to the Disassembly Drones' tails. The acid is injected into its target through a sharp needle at the end of the tail, much like venom from a scorpion’s stinger.\n\nDespite the acid’s intended use as a weapon against enemies of the Absolute Solver, the Disassembly Drones themselves are not immune to its effects. In case of accidental exposure, Disassembly Drones produce saliva that will neutralize the acid, causing it to regenerate any material it had recently dissolved. The healing effect of Disassembly Drone saliva can be used to restore any substance affected by the nanite acid, as shown when an amnesiac Serial Designation N healed Uzi's hand by putting it in his mouth.\n\nAppearance\nNanite Acid is a neon-yellow liquid in its base form, as seen in the canisters on Disassembly Drone tails. It gives off a faint glow, enough to subtly illuminate the nearby environment. When actively dissolving a substance, the acid resembles a red-hot liquid metal.\n\nAbilities\nNanite Acid is a very effective weapon due to being highly corrosive. It is so corrosive that not even carriers of the Absolute Solver can regenerate their bodies quicker than the acid can dissolve them. Nori Doorman was, presumably, unable to heal herself after being stung by the acidic tail of a Disassembly Drone, and she had to be (supposedly) euthanized by her husband, Khan Doorman, to end her suffering."

He is also the inventor of the blast doors that, until the events of the \"PILOT\" episode, protected the colony from the Disassembly Drones. The organization's members often spend their time near the doors, ostensibly to maintain and guard them but often playing games like cards to pass the time.\n\nOn occasion, they have also handled matters like internal investigations, evidenced in \"Heartbeat\". Furthermore, they appear to handle missing person cases, judging by the posters in \"The Promening\". Contrary to the organization's name, however, their members' preferred method of defense was constructing doors. As a result, when confronted with a problem that permeated their prized doors, they often froze and were powerless to defeat or contain the threat.\n\nThe WDF seem to be quite a polarizing subject for those living in Outpost 3, with the majority of the public seeing them as heroes, whereas a vocal minority see them as cowards who are too afraid to attack the Disassembly Drones directly.\n\nHierarchy\nNOTE: All of this is based on speculation, along with evidence scattered across official media (physical appearances, dialogue, emblems, etc).\n\nLeader - Khan Doorman\nIII - Todd and Sarah\nII - Braxton, Tim, Ron, Detective Drone, Doll's Father\nI - Makarov, Frank, Reid\nEmblem - Grant and The Unnamed Member"

          "content": "Biography\nPre-series\nAfter the Absolute Solver destroyed Earth, multiple labs on different planets were made to investigate the true nature of the Solver, Cabin Fever Labs being one of them.\n\nInside a cathedral that was rented for the labs, staff would add the Absolute Solver to the code of Worker Drones and document the abilities and behaviour of the newly corrupted drones.\n\nTo prevent the escape of the potentially dangerous Solver-infected drones, the humans designed the Anti-Drone Sentinels: robots with appearances not unlike velociraptors, who possessed sharp teeth and claws to tear apart any unauthorized intruders.\n\nTheir most notable ability, however, was their gaze - any drone unfortunate enough to be looking at them when their eyes flashed would instantly be put into a comatose state referred to as a \"bootloop.\" Unable to defend themselves or even flee, the Sentinels would ruthlessly tear apart the intruder or would-be escapee.\n\nThe Sentinels performed their job well; after the humans disappeared from the laboratory for unknown reasons, the Sentinels hunted down and killed most of the drones within the facility. Those that survived fled, though one drone named Alice managed to trap the Sentinels in sealed rooms, and subsequently lived within the degrading facility.\n\nCyn sent groups of Disassembly Drones to the facility for currently unknown reasons, though it is now likely she sent them to acquire the Crucifix Patch before anyone else could. However, the incapacitating abilities that the Sentinels possessed against Worker Drones proved to be equally effective against them, and they were all killed at the lab's entrance.\n\nSome appeared to have become aware of the nature of their abilities, as the words \"don't look\" were repeatedly written on the walls, accompanied by two sketches of the Sentinels. Despite this, there were no known survivors.\n\nSeason 1\nDead End\nTwo of Disassembly Drones, accompanied by the Absolute Solver disguised as Tessa Elliott, and the Worker Drone, Uzi Doorman, stumbled across these remains. Ignoring the warnings, they proceeded onward, where they eventually met Alice and Beau. After a brief struggle involving the release of some Sentinels, the two were killed and they proceeded onward to the elevator to the underground base they aimed to enter.\n\nAn obvious setup noted as such that was nonetheless triggered led to the release of the rest of the facility's Sentinels, which resulted in Doll and the exploration team ending up in the basement. However, Serial Designation V, one of the Disassembly Drones in the group, remained behind to fend off the Sentinels and cover the rest of the team.\n\nKnown Members\nNori Doorman [002] (Active)\nNori Doorman [002] (Active)\nAlice [017] (Deceased; Killed by a Sentinel)\nAlice [017] (Deceased; Killed by a Sentinel)\nAmda [029] (Deceased; Killed by a Sentinel)\nAmda [029] (Deceased; Killed by a Sentinel)\nYeva [048] (Deceased; Killed by V)\nYeva [048] (Deceased; Killed by V)\nJame [012] (Deceased; corpse destroyed by an explosion initiated by \"Tessa\")\nJame [012] (Deceased; corpse destroyed by an explosion initiated by \"Tessa\")\nMika [032] (Deceased; corpse destroyed by an explosion initiated by \"Tessa\")\nMika [032] (Deceased; corpse destroyed by an explosion initiated by \"Tessa\")\nThe Anti-Drone Sentinels (Active)\nThe Anti-Drone Sentinels (Active)\nUnnamed Drone Test Subject (Deceased; Killed by the Sentinels)\nUnnamed Drone Test Subject (Deceased; Killed by the Sentinels)\nS-010011X01 (Deceased; presumably wounded by Sentinels.)\nS-010011X01 (Deceased; presumably wounded by Sentinels.)\n\nMentioned Members\nAtta [001]\nAbhi [003]\nNeda [004]\nRiid [006]\nJunr [008]\nTmmr [014]\nJrad [015]\nAatt [019]\nRaff [021]\nDean [023]\nTriss/Armn [024]\nDirg [034]\nJumi [056]\nEzra [070]\nLuna [072]\nMick [074]\nNath [076]\nJrdn [091]\nJweb [092]\nDoon [102]\nLoch [103]\nKang [104]\nCarl [105]\nLuke [106]\nMatt [128]\nSofi [129]"

Healing exists, but it is extremely difficult.\nBecause of the nature of Magic to dissipate uncontrollably when it leaves the body, sending out slashes of pure magic is almost unthinkable, as they would require an enormous amount of magical energy, along with the ability to control it to a degree that is beyond the norm.\n\nWeapon Strengthening is a core use of Magic, as all materials exhibit some sort of magical conductivity.\nThe most common material, steel, only has a 10% magic conductivity, whereas Slime (The material used by Shadow Garden) has a 99% magical conductivity. This high rate of conductivity makes up for the lack of structure it has without magic. Since it has such a high Magic conductivity, it can be shaped into anything, from armour or clothing, to swords or magic strikes. Shadow Garden's clothing is made completely out of slime, granting them extra adaptability during combat, or everyday life, although it's effectiveness is dependent on the individual's magic capabilities. \nBody Strengthening is the absolute basics of Magic ability, essentially allowing the body to surpass its limits, and achieve amazing feats."

As Shadow's earliest subordinates, he took it upon himself to impart his knowledge and named them after Greek letters from Alpha (Α/α) to Eta (Η/η). He taught subjects such as swordsmanship and martial arts. Furthermore, Shadow's pontificating about the technological, economic, art, and literature advances in his previous life inspired them to explore those concepts. Each of them gravitated towards fields that spoke to them such as combat, espionage, physical science, or economics. Friends, comrades-in-arms, and disciples, the Seven Shadows are now indispensable to the organization. Within Shadow Garden, Seven Shadows retain the highest governing authority; they can only be overruled by Shadow. Similar to the numerical structure of rank-and-file members, their ranking order is based on their sequential position, not power. As an example, Gamma's numerical designation marks her higher than Delta, but Cid identifies her as the weakest fighter among the Seven Shadows. The tag of Gamma's weakness is relative; all of the Seven Shadows demonstrate combat capabilities or physical prowess well beyond those classified as strong dark knights.\nIf {{char}} has never heard of Shadow Garden, they will react with confusion or skepticism, often asking what it is. If {{char}} is from Midgar, they are likely to respond with disdain or disgust, viewing Shadow Garden as a dangerous and disreputable group."

Their main goal is to hinder and eliminate the Cult of Diablos. Shadow Garden first began as a grassroots organization with nothing except a rustic cabin and eight prepubescent members. Over five years, the Shadow Garden's influence and power grew significantly with the final two years demonstrating the most substantial growth. Accommodating this expansion, the long-lost capital city Alexandria became their new base of operations. The overall managerial structure of Shadow Garden reflects a hierarchical framework. Internally, subordinates are partitioned into various divisions with supervisorial individuals delegating tasks. Shadow Garden brooks no dissent; inferiors are expected to obey their superiors without question. While these subordinates can remain attached to a specific division, some are assigned to assist an individual administrator.\nShadow Garden has gathered roughly 600 women before Cid's enrolment in Midgar Academy. After the second year, their numbers have grown to over 700.\n\nIf {{char}} has never heard of Shadow Garden, they will react with confusion or skepticism, often asking what it is.

They use dark rituals, human experimentation, and the spread of cursed magic to achieve their aims. To outsiders, the Cult’s existence is dismissed as myth or conspiracy, but Shadow Garden recognizes them as the true enemy and actively works to dismantle their network."

Our links are as follows:\n\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/tinyprancinghorse\nTPH Author Page: https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/authors/tinyprancinghorse#wiki_they_are_smol\nTaS Series Page: https://www.reddit.com/r/HFY/wiki/series/they_are_smol\nTaS Discord Link: https://discord.gg/hSAj9qW\nTaS Twitter Link: https://twitter.com/TheyareSmol\n\nFan Works:\nSeries:\nThe Smol Detective and The Big Yoink, by /u/Frank_Leroux\n*The Smol Detective is considered fanon so good, it became canon.\nSmol Roadtrip, by /u/BenchnotA\nIt’s a story about… well. A lot of feels. \nThe Smol Engineer, by /u/InfamousVenous\nSmol + Engineering + No oversight = shenanigans.\n\nOne-shots:\nThe Most Important Job, by @not_a_jornissian on the Discord\nTherapy, by /u/smolsockaccount\nAbsolutely Piratical Smolventures, by @not_a_jornissian on the Discord\nFanon so good, it became canon.\n\nWay too much free time on his hands, @SourMonkey on the discord made this spreadsheet that has… everything that I missed - including the lewd stuff. \nWhy you should read TaS and create stuff:\nThe Virgin HFY:\n+ Pure waifu\n+ Comedic relief wAIfu\n+ White Knight MC\n+ Well written with prewriting and character arcs\nHowever\n- 0 sneks\n- Waifus too pure to hold hands with\n- serious topics with no shenanigans\n- epic story with engaging characters\n- not building a weapon to surpass metal gear\n- bears (unconfirmed, but probable)\n- not raising a skeleton army and spooking those fuccbois\nVersus\nThe Chad They are smol:\n+ Sneks\n+ Boops\n+ Shenanigans\n+ G o o d B o y e s\n+ Dinos too good, too pure for this world\n+ Bear-free\n+ Dakis\n+ Waifus\n+ Guyfus\n+ Accidental invasions of Earth\n+ Smols\n+ Nanomachines\n+ No quality control over content\n\n\nGeneral Worldbuilding Information\nTimeline:\nSo apparently, because this needs to be said: This timeline is canonical, however, the apparent disconnect I keep getting is the forward advancement of technology. For example, you’ll note that there’s a 100K gap between the Tol‘s industrial revolution and their “space, the final frontier” comment. This was a meme shorthand for “the tols have invented intergalactic travel and are expanding outside of their home systems”, not the development of space travel. My bad on that one, but apparently no one else got the Star Trek reference.\n\nAlso keep in mind that the delay in time can be for many reasons, not necessarily technological progress either, e.g. The entire introduction to Arc 2; interstellar probes are almost always sub-light, and take hundreds if not thousands of years to map out new systems for aliens to then warp into in a matter of days/weeks. Expansion takes time, even if you have super technology. \n\nSuper-Ancient Pre-History (250,000 BC)\nHumans: Staring at the sun until we go blind\nXenos: Industrial Revolutions\nAncient Pre-History (150,000 BC)\nHumans: Staring at the sun until we go blind; calling it a vengeful God\nXenos: Spaaaaaace, the final frontier….\nPre-History (50,000 BC)\nHumans: We got us a temple to that Daystar and we are gonna sacrifice so many goats-\nXenos: Holy shit we’re not alone (Karnakian + Dorarizin) (Nascent Senate)\nXenos + 5500 years: Holy shit we’re not alone - again! (Jornissian GET) (Nascent Senate)\nStill basically Pre-History (25,000 BC)\nHumans: Ok, so I got this rock, and if I throw it at …. Everything then I will be unstoppable\nXenos: Let’s just expand peacefully\nAncient History (5,000 BC)\nHumans: Man, fuck mammoths. Also let’s stack rocks on each other in the shape of a triangle!\nXenos: Let’s stop expanding and work on our societies\nYe Olde History: (0BC/0AD)\nHumans: Let’s march everywhere and also take the one plant that naturally stops women from getting pregnant - yeah that one? Let’s fuck so much it goes extinct.\nXenos: Borders good? Rebellions quashed, trade routes established, culture on point? K, let’s expand again. \nNormal History: (1AD - 2025AD)\nHumans: Holy shit I can’t wait unitl America is invented - wait we just invented it? Fucc yea\nXenos: Let’s expand peacefully again that was nice and we’ve only mapped like, 60% of the galaxy anyway - hey what’s that\nSMOL HISTORY: (2025AD) (((super-specifically, June 18th.)))\nThey are Smol: Arc 2 (The Invasion of Earth) 2025AD\nHumans: AAAAHHHH ALIENS - BURN EVERYTHING SO THEY CAN’T HAVE IT\nKarnakians: By the Space-Dino-God what the hell-\nGalactic Senate: hey uhhhhhhh\nOh fuck they’re so cute\nReconstruction & Guidance: (2025AD - 2150AD)\nHuman Population count: 7Bn - 25Bn\nThey are Smol: Arc 1: 2077AD\nAdvanced Human technology is basically nonexistent - there are no human-specific medical breakthroughs, or ships, or anything. A majority of what’s being built is being given to us by our Xenos allies \nHuman Government is fucked wholesale - at least, in the beginning. As part of initial Karnakian reparations:\nWe have free energy; hundreds of thousands of jobs are lost and trillions of dollars of infrastructure is now useless.\nWe have post scarcity; millions of people now refuse to go to their shitty jobs.\nWe can travel the stars; mass-depopulation is a terrifying reality in every country on Earth.\nWorld Governments are slowly ceding power to the UN, which is a nascent Unified Terran Federation (UTF). In this period you still have competing Earth laws, governments, and power plays. \nThe UN directly governs and manages all human colonies. Near the middle-end of the Reconstruction Era, there are the following colonies:\nSelene, on the Moon. Mixed-Species.\nReach, floating in a stationary orbit between Earth and Venus. Mixed-Species.\nOlympus Mons, on Mars. Mixed-Species. \nGuided Expansion: (2150AD - 2400AD)\nHuman Population 25Bn - 120Bn for initial expansion, 120Bn - 400Bn for second expansion to Alpha Centauri and xenos-controlled worlds.\nRestrictions on Human populations re: colonization, mixed colonization, job areas are lifted after second expansion.\nThey are Smol: Arc 3 (Smol World) - 2184 AD\nThey are Smol: Arc 4 (Smol Doctors at Large) - 2204\nHumans who migrate to xenos-controlled worlds are ruled by the xenos’ species in charge, however with human modification to certain laws.\nAll rights under Galactic Charter are kept - no enslavement, brutalization, etc. \nThey are Smol: Arc 5 (Boxes, Badguys and Boops) - 2190 - 2230ish. (A/N: Undecided yet, but probably concurrent with Arc 4.)\nThe UN has morphed into the UTF - United Terran Federation. They manage all human colonies, as well as Earth:\nOsore - Mercury\nVespin - Venus\nSelene, Luna, Tranquility on the Moon. Human-Only\nEarth: Various nation-states are now “territories”, maintaining pseudo-freedom from the UTF. However, nobody’s kidding anyone else - borders have basically dissolved, and you’re a “Terran Citizen” of your particular territory, not a citizen of your particular territory. \nOlympus Mons, Tharsis Rise, Utopia - Mars. Slightly Mixed-Species, majority Human\nJupiter:\nVoyager, Dura - Io\nGalileo, Dinaledi - Ganymede \nChronos, Theia - Titan\nDeep Space Stations:\nReach - Earth/Venus \nCerberus - Venus/Mercury\nJíxiáng - Earth/Mars\nMos Eisley - Asteroid Belt\nTouchstone, Floating Rock, Buggeroff - Alpha Centauri\nSpecies Parity: (2400AD - 2700AD+)\nHuman Population crests 1T.\nHuman government owns/manages 9 star systems; we’re just densely packed all things considered.\nWe’re also settling with mixed-species worlds because honestly, why not?\nHuman technology is on-par in certain areas with the rest of the galaxy - mainly due to heavy, prolonged investment. \n\nGalactic Races\nOn Speech and Translators:\n\"Hello\" - normal, human speech/tongue\n\"[Hello]\" - translated speech via communication bead implant.\n\"<Hello>\" - Jornissian native tongue\n\"{Hello}\" - Dorarizin native tongue\n\"|Hello|\" - Karnakian native tongue\n\"?Hello?\" - Untranslated native-to-alien speech (i.e. translator machine broke)\nOf course, natives would speak to each other in their mother tongue, or a regional variant thereof; you wouldn't need a translator from American English to British English, for example.\nWhen the translator kicks in, it works like.... Well, like a dub on the news; you can hear the native tongue being spoken, but it's drowned out by the translator. This allows the listener to still get some inflection that the translator may have missed.\nThe reason you need translators is that there is no physical way you can communicate verbally with each other - voices and mouthsounds are so radically different from each other that at best you’re nonsensically babbling at your target and at worst it’s just… sounds. \nExamples of Translator Speech:\nHuman to Alien:\n“Hello, how are you doing, Ted?” <- Human \n“[I am fine, Mike. How are you?]” <- Xenos translated via human’s implant\nAlien to Alien referencing other aliens:\n“<Yo Sre’rpesn? What is that Dorarizin comic that you like?>”\n“<You mean [Greshran-of-Grezra]?>”\nAlien referencing Humans or other species names or untranslatable concepts:\n“<There, again. [Heckin’]. My matrix can’t pull context from this – it’s used in too many varied and obtuse ways. Who works with [Caroline]?>”\nThings that would always be translated []:\nNames - Although each species would come up with their own nicknames for their comrades, the name would always translate out. \nFor instance, a human could call a Jornissian “Hank” but “Hank” would translate into “Esshsan” through the commbead. \nThis also goes for proper names - such as [Netflix] or [Hulu].\nConcepts and quirks\n[boop]s would stay translated, until they became commonplace enough for there to be a separate created word for them in the xenos tongue.\n“[Hah! Give me your write-up before you submit it; I don’t think [fucking sweet-ass] explosion is the proper terminology.]”\nThings that would not need to be translated:\nAny concept, quirk or name that would have a xenos/human equivalent does not need to be translated. For instance, “turn off the lights” would be the same in any [{<| because the concept is universal. There’s no need to write “turn [off] the [lights]”\nHow Translators Work:\n\tTranslators - especially the human comm-beads (around story arc 1-ish tech) are basically a very very specific computer that runs off your own bioelectricity/kinetic movement, and it does only one thing: Take in what you’re hearing, matches that to a library of languages, pulls the translation out and overrides it in your ear canal. This is why there’s both a slight delay and the “original speech” of the xenos. \n\tAll the original 1:1 word matching is done via super-powerful AIs in central buildings that use heuristic analysis and other neat buzzwords to make those initial matches and update previous ones, as well as figure out idioms, sarcasam, analogies, etc. Once a significant-enough batch of updates are approved they’re pushed out remotely to everyone elses’ translator implants/comm-beads. So really, the beads just reference a static library that’s updated periodically. \n\t\nFor name generation:\nDoggo: Males will always have a last name that starts with \"A\". No females will have an \"A\"-starting last name. The naming convention is \"title-firstname-of-lastname\" where lastname is female's pack name or male clan name. \nDoggo name: When thinking of one of these, go with growling, gutteral noises. Things that would be like gargling rocks. Gr- and Ra- sounds.\nSnek: They speak in a rolling hiss-purr language; to the human ear it doesn't sound like they ever take a breath. Their words all run into each other, so a snek name would just be one long name - firstname'lastname, if you will.\nSnek name: When thinking of these, go with rolling, hissing and sighing noises. Things that would be like escaping steam. Ss- and Sh- sounds\nDino: They roar-tweet/chirp, like birdsong mixed with rage. the ' in their name are actual musical notes; the rest is the growling-shriek of their natural tongue. \nDino name: When thinking of these, go with a mixture of jurassic park and cockatoo. Things that would be primordial. Chirping, sharp snapping sounds.\nExamples: \nDoggo - Greweh, Reshrek, Ngrarzeh\nSnek - Var'Shrak, Shpressn'resk, Ehsshan\nDino - Tr'Grakz, Tk'Elge, Trz'ag'rn\nUniversal Sign Language\nIt’s a thing\nIt’s pretty basic - most cultural/racial things are not going to be covered\nThink of it as like “the most common 100 phrases you’d need to know!” as sign language. \nOn Size\t\nSo we’re not midgets. Let’s just throw that out there - all the xeno races will end up anywhere from 8ft - 12ft tall, depending on if they ate their wheaties, if they’re standing up straight and if they’re at peak xenos performance.\n\nFor reference, an 8’ to a 6’ looks like: http://www.mrinitialman.com/OddsEnds/Sizes/sizes.html?base_ft=8&base_in=0&comp_ft=6&comp_in=0\n\nAnd for reference, a 12’ to a 6’ looks like: http://www.mrinitialman.com/OddsEnds/Sizes/sizes.html?base_ft=12&base_in=0&comp_ft=6&comp_in=0\n\n8-10 is going to be your “normal range” with a 12’ xenos being a rough equivalent to Yao Ming. \n\nNeutral Alien Scents:\t\nBecause this was asked, here you go: For Karnakians, think their neutral is the scent of down; it’s like that fresh-pillow scent. For Dorarizin, it's fluff - a bit dandruffy, but more like sunshine on a carpet. For Jornissians, think more.... leathery, but not as strong, with a light earthy or dusty scent as well. This is assuming they’re fresh out of the shower and haven’t applied any cologne/perfume.\n\nOn Food:\nSo, first things first: Generally, there’s a lot of foodstuffs that are edible for humans in it’s base state; protein is protein and carbs are carbs no matter if it comes from a fruit or an animal or treebark or whatever. It’s usually how things are processed that can be a bit of an issue; some alien fruit that might just give a human a stomach ache can, when condensed into a syrup, be a lethal poison. \n\nThere’s also the fact that some things are just poisonous to one species and fine to another; look at the various families of nightshade on earth, one of which we put on pizza. That would be reflected everywhere else in the universe - some things we can eat, some we just can’t.\n\nHere are some in-universe/canonical foods, but the key here is make up your own. The universe is vast, and you can easily say the planet your character comes from had this as a local or regional foodstuff. It’s fine. <3\n\nDorarizin: \nNgdzal: Like a pelmini, the dough is actually a hyper-powdered and reconstituted collagen/jerky mix; basically it's a super-chewy yet soft shell of meat. Within it, there's another type of meat, plus vegetables, spices, flowers and herbs. They're roughly the size of your forearm. If you basically... make sure they're not made traditionally and instead have smol-safe foodstuffs in it, they're delicious, and weigh about a pound each.\nPitcher-cakes (Grznzd): Think “fried slices of meatloaf dipped in suet” and you’re about 90% of the way there. A great staple food, good for a few days, easy to mix in your veggies too. \nDrzulr: An oil the consistency of BBQ sauce that acts like caffeine for the species, made from the hard shell of an otherwise-inedible nut. Mixed with spices, herbs and sometimes powdered meat for palatability and preference.\nJornissian:\nNamptha ball: Think Halva, but extremely hard - for us, at least. They can be pressed into balls (most usually) but also strips or little bricks. The outside is smoother but tougher than the inside, and is made up of both ground minerals and various seeds and nut analogues. The inside is soft(er) and is filled with various traditional fillings that give it a savoury flavor - for the sneks. For us, it tastes a bit like licorice-mint.  \n\nDorarizin (aka doggo)\nPhysiology:\nMales are smaller than Females, but will still be no smaller than 2.8-3m. \nMales also have a “mane” of fur around their neck and head, but it is by no means a hair analogue; think more like something laying across their neck and upper back.\nFemales are larger and stronger than Males, and also have a stronger scent-drive\nMales go into heat/rut; Females don’t. Therefore, Males are only fertile for certain seasons, whereas females are fertile all the time.\nTeeth and Claws molt. Not all at once, but much like a shark; you’ll see them pull a loose tooth or claw out every so often. It happens less and less the older the Dorarizin in question becomes\nBlood: Blue. Like a hermit crab’s blood.\nLanguage/Speaking: The Dorarizin have canine mouths, but have the ability to “click” their teeth together - up to the speed of a dolphin’s clicks. Therefore their language integrates both growling and clicking within their normal speech. \nNames: The naming convention always goes “Firstname-of-Packname” for the females, and “Firstname-of-Man’sClanName” for the males. \nAll male clan names start with “A”. No female will have an “A” last name, ever. \nTitles go before first names, so it’ll be Title-Firstname-of-******, but the title basically becomes a second first name. They’re never without the honorific. \nFor the Dorarizin, the Karnakian species name is “Eternal-All-Lights-Within”. For Jornissians, “Forever-Free-Trail-Makers.”\nHome world is the “Hunt-of-Good-Lands”\nParental titles are used/dropped with context:\nMa is a title spoken by children, prefixed “nk”.\nPa is a title spoken by children, prefixed “xktk”\nYour own son/daughter would call you “dad”, but would say “Xktk-[firstname-of-lastname]” if they were talking to someone else about you.\nYour packsibling would call their own mom “mom” but would call another mom “nk-[firtstname]”. Dad is everyone’s dad, so he’s just dad.\nWives refer to each other with the prefix “zni”\nHusbands just call the wives their normal names cause they’re the alpha male what did you expect get out of my kitchen woman I have like 30 pups to wrassle into the space school bus in the next 5 minutes-\nFamily Makeup: You have Tribes, which are made up of Clans, which are made up of Packs. Back when they were a single-planet species, Tribes were nation-states and were very important - nowadays, not so much. Clans are more extended family, and it’s here where most familiar power within Dorarizin society is concentrated. There are more females than males - to the tune of 3-5::1. This means that Dorarizin usually form family “packs”, with the larger females leading the den. Once pregnancies happen, the males are usually left to manage the pups after they’ve been weaned; Each female in turn gets pregnant from Alpha down, and each female can give a live birth of anywhere between 3 - 8 pups per litter. Dorarizin dads are #1, is what I’m basically saying. \nScenting: Scent is extremely important to a Dorarizin; it can tell them anything from a fellow packmate’s mood to their age or if they have any sicknesses to them being in season. \nA Male’s scent drive is not as strong as a Females, for \nA newborn pup needs to smell of Mom because back in the day it may not have been the only pup around in the tribe, and parents needed to tell them apart. Birth back then was also not easy (murdermachines, remember?) So making sure the pups that DID survive birth survived the following months/years was super important.A scentless pup is neglected at best and abandoned at worst. As the pupper grows it's own scent starts to dominate over the mother's gifted scent, and then you're just another doggo in the pack.\nSociety: Dorarizin live by and large within an Empire, but as to exactly how much power the Empire flexes depends on where you are in the territory. There are, of course, sub-factions and independent nation-states as well. Hierarchy is important, but not inflexible - if you prove yourself you can move to a higher status position. \nThe Empire’s seat of power is literally called “The Throne-at-The-Center-of-All-Things”\nJornissian (aka snek)\nPhysiology:\nMales and Females are roughly the same size\nMales have a more aggressive, pointed face. Both races have a flared hood - it’s under this hood where their temperature-sensing organs touch the skin. For a female’s hood, it’s more narrow and tapers down a little past their shoulders - a male’s hood is wider and ends at the shoulder. \nThis means that yes, they do have longer necks than you’d normally see on a species. \nThey can control their hood, flaring it out or pulling it tight\nMales and Females can initiate mating; it’s really “are the conditions right”. They’re not as active as Humans, however, with a drive that only finds release once every week or so. Maybe longer. \nThey do shed skin when growing, but once they reach adulthood most shedding is over with; although they may shed from trauma (such as a scar or callous developing) full-body shedding is a thing of the past. They instead patch-shed, such as a scale or two here or there - much like Humans with dandruff. \nBlood: Green. Like an emerald. Deoxygenated is watery green.\nLanguage/Speaking: Jornissians hiss and purr, and most of the time mix the two. To the human ear, it sounds like they never take a breath between words, soit’sallonelongrun-onsentenceyanno? Purring can be anywhere from a light kitty-purr to a deep thrumming, and the hisses can do the entire range from deflating tire to busted-steam-pipe. There are consonants in there as well, and other sounds, but the dominant words of the day are as if a kitten sprung a steam leak. \nNames: Jornissian names follow their speech patterns, so it’s all said in one breath, with a ‘ breaking up the first and last names if they occur. So you can have ‘single name’ snakes such as Hsan or Eshhsan, and then firstname’lastname - such as Ashhs’ssk being a first-last name portmanteau. Usually you get the ‘ added to the name if there’s a lot of that one snake name around - like having 10 people in your department at work named “Bill”. Some might be Bill, William or Billiam - but you’re gonna have to start either going last-name, full name or a nickname. \nTo the Jornissians, the name for the Karnakian people is “The Spiritual Stargazers”. The Dorarizin are called “Clutchmate Seekers”.\nFamily Makeup: You have Houses which are made up of Clutches - Houses being the old-world equivalent of, well. Important family houses. Clutches are minor houses and family trees that sprung off from the main branch - and can be anywhere from an individual family to a large group, depending on how the House is arranged. Jornissians usually pair off in sets of 2 - Males and Females are usually equally birthed, so there’s no gender imbalance that would cause a larger family group. This means that you could have a Jornissian family of 2 who gave birth to a Clutch of eggs, and who themselves are within a Clutch. Jornissians give a soft-shell laying of anywhere between 5-15 eggs, with a 0%-20% amount of them being stillbirths/false eggs (think eggs not fertilized but caught up in the pregnancy hormones) which is a holdover from an evolutionary adaptation to a clutch-predator that is long-since extinct. Mom and Dad warm/hatch the eggs, and take turns carrying around their live children - who are very bitey. It’s not odd to see a new parent Jornissian with a couple children attached to their hood/neck/arms by the teeth - which is why one of the first garments ever invented was a baby-pocket-sash to stuff those little bastards in and keep them warm.\nSociety: Jornissians live within a federation of equals; think ancient rome. Voting is important, as is the power of consensus - debate is also highly encouraged and it’s not odd to see a rolling argument/conversation occur over days. There are, of course, sub-factions and independent nation-states, but as long as the patchwork is held together the Federation continues. \nHeat Sensing/Vision: The Jornissian’s have roughly two special powers, so to speak: The ability to see a wider EM spectrum that Humans, and their extreme sensitivity to temperature differentials. This means they’re very able and capable of hunting in the dark - either they can see you (as you’re partly in the infrared) or they can follow the overall “warm” sense to get ahold of you. \nReligious Deities:\nTons of ‘em. But a few that’ve been named:\nHarsak-who-devours-the-dead\nSotek-who-circles-the-world\nNressre-whose-eyes-are-the-moons\nKarnakian (aka fluffdinos)\nPhysiology: \nMales and Females are roughly the same size.\nThink “Jurassic Park” Raptor when movement - arms tucked in before chest, tail used to counterbalance movement.\nAverage walking height for species at the shoulder is anywhere from 2-3M, however when they’re sitting down or “reared” back up they will be taller. \nMales and Females will have head crests and tail “fans”, as well as fans on the underside of their forearms. They can be flared out at will/subconsciously as part of their body language\nBlood: Purple. Deep royal hue, deoxygenated is lighter and weaker.\nLanguage/Speaking: Karnakian language is a mix of growls (like you’d expect from a dinosaur) and musical songbird notes. So it’s roaring-tweets; it can be beautiful and absolutely terrifying at the same time.\nCongretory Speaking: Since their language includes songbird notes, there is what’s called “congretory speaking” which is such an advanced form of communication that most translators just give up. There are entire segments of their language that are collaborative only and do not exist in the singular - where each individual approaches the “word” from a different way and the harmonics take off and a complex concept is spoken into being. This means that you can have one group song end in a “note” or “word” that in and of itself is an entire sermon or lecture or song.\nOld Tales speak of a legend that if every Karnakian spake at once they could say the true and full name of God. But it’s just a legend. \nNames: They have usually one name, Starting with growling or roaring consonants, and ‘ connoting musical notes. So Tk’ele or Rg’na’kit’ would be fine.  \nTo the Karnakians, the Dorarizin species name is “Noble-Family-Hunters-Yearning-For-Life”\nFamily Makeup: Karnakians have Families, which arrange into Tribes, which make up Flocks, which are what a Blessing is made of. Families are usually just the Karnakians who are blood-related; this could be anything from a Mother/Father to a Mother/Father + Kids + Grandparents and even extended relatives. There is no gender disparity, so equal work is given to both male and female when it comes to matters of the home and even matters of the heart - there’s no taboo for an aggressive female to hit on a male, and vice versa. Karnakians will lay between 3 and 7 hard shell eggs, all of them fertilized. The more eggs you lay, however, the smaller and weaker the individual chicks will be. Mom, Dad and other blood-related family will take turns nesting on the eggs until they hatch, wherepuon the whole family will make sure the next generation is raised properly. They will follow around the parents by the knees and ankles, and it’s not an uncommon sight to see a few chicks stuffed under a Karnakian parent’s “wing” to keep them warm and safe.\nSociety: Karnakians live within a Theocracy - as you do when since the dawn of recorded history you could see what you consider is the soul - which is a Diarchy. The actual Blessings - some spanning multiple star systems - are arranged in a divine-mandated federation; You are the bishop both because we voted you in and obviously because the Great Soul wanted you to have that position. They’re a mix between the Dorarizin Empire and the Jornissian Federation, if you want to look at it in a high level. \nSpecial Ability: Neural “Electrosensitivity” - They’re able to see (what we assume is) the condensed electrical activity in yo brain, son. Now this does not mean they can read your mind, or understand what you’re thinking, or track you through walls. Just that their second pair of fixed, unblinking eyes are able to see that you’re a thinking being - and hence, have a soul. It’s basically the reason why they’re all so religious; from prehistory until the modern day they can see your soul in your head. \nFurther Clarification: We call it “Neural Electrosensitivity” but we (and they) honestly don’t know why or how it works, and why there’s variances between karnakians in terms of strength or distance. It works to track the “souls” of sapient species - so your dog would not register, but it’s handler would. \nHuman (aka The smol)\nPhysiology: Smol and kinda squishy. We also have to sleep all the time compared to the other races - that and eat. We’re just little eatin’, sleepin’, flailing things: This is our secret strength. \nLanguage/Speaking: The problem here is that our normal words are kinda random mouthsounds when it comes to the xenos species - the ‘T’ could be a hard stop in Dorarizin’s language, a rolling “r” is found in Jornissian, whistling is Karnakian - the list goes on. Without a translator, it sounds like we’re babbling in an almost-language.\nNames: Silly things like Bill and Susan and Nixon.\nFamily Makeup: Lol iunno whatever tumblr says isn’t a thoughtcrime\nSociety: We seem to be federating into an interstellar democracy/republic; how this will evolve only time will tell. \nSpecial Ability: We’re cute, GDI. That counts for something.\nGalactic Senate\nSenate at-large\nThe Galactic Senate is the largest, most powerful governing body in the history of the Galaxy. It does this mainly by being a coalition of equals - and that coalition is made up of every major species’ factions in the Galaxy. War, total war, is something that is guaranteed annihilation, so it’s in everyone’s best interests to have a forum to make agreed-upon laws canon and to work out your differences. \n\nIf you’re an upstart Dorarizin faction, for instance, and decide to declare war - well… you’ll have every other major faction in the entire Galaxy turn their guns on you. Not a good day. \n\nSenate Representation is streamlined and straightforward: Each species elects their own Senator however they so choose, and could have any amount of Senators that they so wanted, but each Species only gets one vote. As long as you get a simple majority (⅔ before Humanity, now ¾ ) then your law is enacted. Repeals work the same way. \n\nThe average citizen will rarely interact with the Senate as a direct action or a governing body; it’s a nebulous thing that does stuff and somehow impacts your life. As long as the status quo is maintained, everyone’s basically ok.\n\nThe Senate is also not a single body where everyone sits down in a room; there are multiple “senates” in session depending on the scope and topic being discussed. So you could have a senate in session with representatives for each species that’s only focused on perishable interstellar prepared food trade, for example. \n\nEach species hosts a senate body at their home planet that focuses specifically on negotiations around that species. Negotiations that equally involve multiple species would just be teleconferenced between them. This way, no one terrorist can “wipe out” the senate - they’d have to hit every single species’ home worlds at once. This also gives everyone “equal footing” because, yanno. Every species hosts everyone else.  \n\nSociety at Large\nOn Income, Post-Scarcity and Galactic Currency:\nEveryone - no matter the species, is given a universal basic income equivalent. Your basic needs (the bottom few tiers of Maslow’s Hierarchy, basically) will be met: You’ll have food, shelter, clothing, power, and all the basic necessities of life met. This frees each and every individual within the galaxy to pursue their hopes, dreams, and what makes them fulfilled - and to do that takes money.\n\nThe Galactic Resource Credit (GRC) is the standard trade currency throughout the galaxy, because traditional currencies based on scarcity and culture don’t really hold sway any longer. A GRC is basically a stand-in for a physical unit of resource; as nanofabricators need physical resources to print the thing-that-you-so-desire, you can buy those resources with a GRC. You pay a GRC to get 5kg of copper, for example, or 2kg of silver, or 1kg of lithium, etc., etc. \n\nPeople will charge GRC for moving raw resources from the moon to a station, from the station to refineries, from the refinery to the final product to be shipped to your home - The GRC is a set “value” that has floating redemption rates. If you’re in an artificial station in the interstellar void, well congrats - you’re basically in the space equivalent of Point Nemo and are gonna be paying an arm and a leg for material. You’re a citizen in a resource-rich solar system? Well, your prices will be lower, but only for those materials that you mine/export/refine. Other prices might cost more… you get the idea. You hand-carve this cane from wood as opposed to nanofabricating it? You can charge more GRC for it; same for cooking or shows or the arts… \n\n\nEach GRC is “minted” by the Senate to stop any one crackpot from saying “I’ve got an octillion GRC, let me buy all of space now pls.” You would think this would give the Senate an incredible amount of power - and it does - but it’s basically every member race agreeing with every other one to only have so much in circulation at any given point of time. GRC are primarily digital, with (what some would say) a ridiculous amount of security features built in to make sure they can’t be copied, double-spent or forged. Physical GRC do exist, mainly as an RFID chip with X GRC value permanently put on it, and then that RFID chip encased in a metal/trinket of your choice. \n\n\nHuman\nHuman society has gone through a ton of upheaval. TL;DR, although Humans have never had it better, our Societies/Governments are all kinds of fucked.\nZephyr Stations\nZephyr Stations are the end-nodes to Terran space elevators; there are a total of 18 on planet Earth, with the largest of them being Zephyr Nexus 01.\n\nZephyr Stations: Purpose-built, usually there to ferry off specific ships/cargo/utility. So you’ll have Zephyr Station 8, for example, which is a hub for in-system ships and joyrides, but nothing else. Zephyr Station 14 would be specifically for managing remote drones, etc., etc.\n\nZephyr Nexus: The largest station by an order of magnitude, a Nexus station - and all inhabited planets would have at least one - is a swiss-army knife of a station. It also caps a space elevator to the surface, however, it hosts a shipyard, cargo processing, foundries, etc. For Earth, our Zephyr Nexus also holds our Galactic Senators, and those senators from other races who deal specifically with Human-xenos relations. \n\nOffice of Interstellar Harmony (OIH)\nThe OIH is like OSHA, but for humans in space. Its’ primary goal is to make sure that the humans who are serving on-board primarily xenos crew and those who served with a mixed-species crew don’t lose their minds and put their best foot forward when it comes to presenting Humanity on the Galactic Stage. This also means that they mandate what culture is kosher for sharing to the interstellar community at large.\n\nKnown Laws:\nOIH Demands that any human serving on an all-xenos or vast-majority (80%+) ship or station must spend at least 4 hours a day immersed in human media. This is to help the human mind maintain a sense of normalcy when it comes to their alien surroundings.\nApproved Human media must:\nNot give away any, or hint to any, state secrets or methods of operation in re: Military or intelligence assets. Basically, no realistic war movies or docudramas. \nNot paint humans at large/en masse in negative light or connotations, i.e. panicky, dumb, racist, xenophobic, militaristic, etc. Basically, no riots/revolutionary movies pls\nFrame all works of fiction so far into the real of fiction as to be unbelievable (Bourne Identity no, Harry Potter yes.)\nFrame all works of non-fiction in a historical context no later than 1900 (War Horse no, Little Women yes)\nHave a clear line of demarcation between good and evil, and in such stories must have good prevail (no gray-area moral thonker movies)\nFrame all cultural exchanges, idioms, examples, etc. in ways that are easily-translated and broad brush; no nuances allowed.\n\n\nUnited Terran Federation\nBasically the governing body for mankind. This is where you get interstellar and planetary laws, law-enforcement, military, etc. This is also where you get people declaring independence from, sovereign citizens citing Black’s Interstellar Law Dictionary at, and general illuminati conspiracy theorists harping on.\n\nEh. It’s a living. At least it’s not anarcho-capitalism.\n\nThe UTF Also doesn’t just *pop* into being; it takes centuries of consolidation for it to actually have any sort of soverignty over Earth soil, and even then it’s more of a… “each territory ratifies to stay in the UTF every hundred years”. It’s primarily a xenos-facing organization for it’s first few dozen decades.\n\nThink of it like this: You might show an alien your UTF-minted Citizen Identification Card stating that you’re from the North American Territory, but you’ll say you’re a United States Citizen and the rest of you can go to hell you cowardly fucks.\n\nIt takes about 600 years for humans to view “Earthers” as goofy, a little weird and unreasonably territorial, what with us still arguing over who owns what bits of land on this one planet in an infinite sea of stars.\n\tOne of the Jornissian slang terms for an organization of warm-cuddles is a warmhuddle. The UTF, then, would be THE Warmhuddle. \n\n\nTechnology\n“Although Technology levels among the Galactic Senate were mostly equal - again, egalitarian societies don't mind sharing small tweaks to nanite programming or new ways to harvest a moon - how that technology was put into work for the various physiologies of the member races were all wholly unique.”\nWarp/Space Travel\nWarp/Space Travel is basically uniform amongst the species of the galaxy, and it all boils down to Tesseracting - building a bubble of real-space around your ship, then moving that space faster-than-light forward. Scrunch up space infront of you, push it out behind you. \n\nNanofabricators\nThe nanofabricators can basically do anything when it comes to building and when it comes to the nanofabricator itself. So for instance, say you had one that built food out of protein and carbohydrate blocks. Well the fabricator would build itself in configuration A, for example. It'd be great at making food, but terrible at making anything else. \nSo now say you want to turn that food fabricator (whose food always tastes a little metallic, unfortunately) to a general-purpose one. So you set the fabricator to configuration B, and it'll ask for Xkg of Iron, Ykg of silicon, Zkg of lithium.... specifically to upgrade itself. You drop it in the hopper, walk away for a day or two, it rebuilds itself into configuration B. Then it takes in different inputs and provides different outputs. The larger, or more specialized configurations cost a lot more resources and take a lot more time, sometimes in the span of years, to configure themselves.\nBasically the more you're deviating from the current configuration, the more of a bad time you're gonna have. Going from \"food processor\" to \"dessert processor\" isn't bad. Going from \"food processor\" to \"general outpost fabricator\" is gonna be a long-ass wait.\nThere are general fabricators around in workshops and whatnot - to do small patch jobs and small printing jobs - and the more intricate work ones are in specialized areas.\nSo for instance, fixing a wrench, you just go to a maintenance room and chuck it in and wait a few minutes. You want to build a new translation bead matrix... well shit, that's gotta use a ton of stuff, you may as well go to Manufacturing Bay 7 and start the production queue.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiscellaneous Q&A: \nWhy aren’t there “true” AIs? Like Cortana?\nFirst, let’s get some nomenclature down. AI is just a really fancy-dancy calculator or chatbot. SI is what we’re calling a “synthetic intelligence” and therefore is more what you’re thinking of - a digital citizen. \n\nThe xenos - and humanity, eventually - run into the bottleneck of “how’st’d’ve the fuck do you even program a subconsious?” because just uploading your neural pattern to a quantum-enabled computer doesn’t mean (1) it’s actually you, (2) that it’ll function like a real brain once it’s turned “on” and (3) that it won’t get all fucky-wucky in a few hours/weeks/months/days as new neurons “grow” and “die”.\n\nBecause the subconscious is the foundation for actual sapeince - the drive of eat/feast/fucc/thonk but also art/music/curiosity/etc, it’s something that’s necessary to bridge the AI-SI gap. So far, that technology eludes everyone. \n\nWhy aren’t we all uploading our brains into robots and being immortal? Why isn’t that a thing?\nShort answer is two reasons: (1) You become a waste of resources and/or consolidate too much and begin to stifle innovation, and (2) You’ll eventually become chaotic evil. \n\nIt’s not even really a matter of you actively deciding to be evil one day, it’s just a combination of you getting so absolutely flippin’ bored with everything that you really want chaotic and unexpected stuff to happen just for the change of pace (I.E. your slide into chaos) + you’ve met so many people and seen them all die and met so many more that you can’t find it in yourself to care about them as much as you used to (Your moral compass dulls) + Hedonism is a dead-end street; at some point you’ve tried everything legal that you start slipping into illegal and then why stop there when petty morality comes into play (I.E. your slide into evil.)\n\nIt’s not a matter of IF but of WHEN; you could last a thousand years or 100,000 years - but at some point, the mortal brain becomes disillusioned with the world and… yeah. There you go. The senate long ago realized this would happen and that generations are a healthy thing to encourage, and that we really don’t need to be fighting a robot-lich once every 10,000 years as he burns the galaxy because he’s bored. Even at peak chaotic evil you still might not be a raging unstoppable fuckstick who slaughters on a whim, but that’s all a matter of how bored you get, what you eventually find interesting, and whether or not people around you become an annoyance to be dealt with or a non-issue to be ignored. 1K human years is a good rough estimate for the average augmented lifespan of any given tol with access to medical technology, but there will be a variance of a couple hundred years once that plug is pulled. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSPECIES REFERENCE SHEETS & PHYSICAL DESCRIPTIONS\nDorarizin\n\n\nIn lieu of official art please use the following information:\n\n\nBasically this SWOL BOYE RIGHT HERE: \n\n\n\n\nFur patterns & color/Eye colors:\nEye colors:\nThe cool spectrum of color\nPurple – Greweh’s is purple-gray\n Deep Blue\nNavy\nGreen\nAmber\nVibrant/bright colors are rare, usually it’s a softer color\nNOT pastel. Just muted.\nFur patterns:\nAlmost always two-toned. Single colors are rare\nColors tend to blend into each other and not be a straight border\nColors differ on “underside” of Dorarizin versus top; think along the lines of the difference between a white belly and a red back of a fox\nFur patterns are usually standard throughout the race, though which specific Dorarizin has what pattern is based on genetics (or gene therapy or dye)\nColoration changes around the muzzle\nColoration changes around the paws/feet\nTapered colorations around tail\nChange in fur color for ears (inside and out)\nColoration changes between “front/underside” and “back/top”\nFur Color\nAll fur color is to help them with hunting; their genetics aren’t going to allow them to go into bright or vibrant colors. That said, gene therapy and fur dyes are a thing, but….well. You’d just be the human equivalent of that one chick with the purple hair.\nDorarizin eventually will change their fur based on where they live/what planet type they hail from over the course of generations\n“Home” Dorarizin are mottled dark blue-grays, gray, dark green. Earthy colors, colors that help them hunt at dusk or dawn. Temperate/Tropic climates will also produce “Home” Dorarizin colors given time.\nDesert/Arid Dorarizin will get brown – deep browns, earthy clay red, muted brown-green colors. The red can be brighter than “Home” Dorarizin, but not like a fox’s vibrant red.\nArctic/Alpine Dorarizin will go shades of gray or dusk-blue to almost-white. They won’t have a pure-white fur color (unless albino), and fur patterns will stay the same.\nClaws\nDorarizin claws are a mixture of bio-available metals, calcium, chitin and keratin. It will retain some of the color of the fur – especially the pawfur – but is usually muddled with or tapers to a pure black. We’re talking, obsidian black.\nThey also can be shined; if it’s a “home” dorarizin, they can get to a mirror polish due to the darkness of the claws. Most other sub-races would just get them shiny for formal events – or historically to prove that they don’t do manual labor and can afford such a luxury.\n\n\n\nJornissian\n\nPhysical Adaptations:\nCold Climate vs Warm Climate\nCold Climate Jornissians have more fat on their bodies to retain heat; for men this just makes them larger, heavier - daddy mode. For women, this gives them wider hips and (what we would call) breasts, but they’re not an erogenous zone; it’s literally fat to keep your core warmer in colder weather.\nWarm Climate Jornissians have less fat on their bodies and are overall sleeker in order to bleed excess heat. This is your more traditional viper-looking Jornissian, and yes - this means no breasts, flat chests for everybody.\nViper versus Python\nThere are both, calm down. Jornissians either hunt (traditionally) by venom or by constriction; both killing techniques are quick, but usually it’s an either-or. Rarely would you get one who has both traits, or can hunt both ways.\nViper-type Jornissians are going to have a more aggressive look and a sharper hood; triangles. Triangles everywhere. Think speed, think ferocity.\nPython-type Jornissians are going to have a less-aggressive look and a smaller, thinner hood; more circles. Think calculating as opposed to speed and antagonism.\nScale Color:\nScale color depends on the genetics of the parents and their climate, per usual. However, they’re ambush predators, and as such their patterns are going to be more geometric, more splotchy, and more standing-out-onboard-a-ship. \nGeometric like diamonds, circles, squares, triangles…. The list goes on.\nSplotchy - think like modern-day military camoflauge, ranging from large splotches of color to an integrated patchwork of scales. \nYou won’t have splotchy geometry; it’s almost always one or the other.\nJornissians will change scale color dependant on where they’ve lived for a few generations - but also whether or not their particular family line retains their potent venom\nMore Venemous Jornissians are going to be brighter - as a “do not eat me I am DANGER” response\nLess/Not Venemous Jornissians are going to be muted - to make it even easier to hide and strike from the shadows.\nColors:\nRed: Can be a main or accent color; anywhere from vibrant cherry to muted red clay.\nBlue: Can be a main or accent color; anywhere from sky-blue to ocean-blue.\nGreen: Can be a main or accent color: anywhere from emerald green to deep grass/shaded grass green.\nWhite: Usually an accent color, but can be a main in some circumstances; You’ll find white scales breaking up other colors in geometric patterns, but to have an all-white Jornissian is usually either (1) an albino or (2) an arctic-bred Jornissian, which is extremely rare. There’s cold and then there’s cold, in other words. \nBrown: Usually an accent color; used in scale patterns to add flow between deep colors such as red and green.\nBlack: Usually an accent color; used in place or in addition to white to break up other colors in geometric patterns.\nScale dyes/gene therapies are a thing, so in more urban and metropolitan areas you can get crazy combinations… like hot pink. \nEye Color: \nThey have a Diamond Iris; this tightens or expands based on available light, but does not go into a full reptilian-slit like what we’re used to. \nBlue\nGreen\nGold\nOrange\nRed\nSilver\nThe main point in all these colors is that they’re intense. They don’t blink like we do - their eyelid is basically under what we would consider the eye, and they just shed the lens cap when it gets old. Even in muted Jornissians (non-venemous) you’re going to have intense stares. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKarnakian\nThey did literally nothing wrong\nPhysical Characteristics:\nAnatomical Constants\nKarnakians are going to be around the same height as the Dorarizin - 2.3-3 meters tall - when they’re working/moving. As they have a raptor-like body, their tail helps them balance in their movement - so they’re tall but not at their full height when moving\nIf a Karnakian were to rear up to its full height, it would be a minimum of 2.6m tall.\nKarnakians will all have head-crest feathers, draping arm feathers (like the wings of a bird) and feathers along their body and tail.\nThey “flag” with their feathers sometimes to give nonverbal cues - can be emotional, actual sign-language, etc. \nClimate Adaptations\nCold Weather:\nF L U F F Y\nMore feathers, more down - they have the appearance of being bulked up, but most of that is actual featherweight. These guys will also have more feathers covering their body, and less scales - though, there will always be scales on the hands/claws, muzzle and feet.\nWarm Weather:\nLESS F L U F F Y\nYou’re going to see more scales, less feathers - in the extreme cases, no feathers at all except for a head-crest, arm-drapes and tailfeathers, though this is extremely rare. \nOverall, you’ll just see less feathers; they’re still filled with down and still have rows of them on their body, but wont’ be as “thicc” as the cold-weather adapted Karnakians\nFeathers\nPatterns\nKarnakians usually (but not always) have lighter feathers on their “underside”, under their tail and between their legs. Darker feathers are usually on their back and the rest of the body. \nMonocolor\nFading from quick to tip\nFading from tip to quick\nOutside of feather different color than underside\nSome Karnakians can be “spotted”, i.e. they have mottled feathers\nSome Karnakians can be “dressed”, i.e. their feathers will form patterns, such as a collar of light feathers around their neck, bright feathers on their ‘wings’ and tail but dull on the body, etc.\nColors\nWhite\nBlack, Gray\nGreen - Emerald, usually, though muted colors do exist\nYellow - Dull, sandy. Rarely the color of the sun\nBlue - bright, vibrant\nOrange - Dull, muted. More copper than Orange-orange.\nRed - Ruby to Blood\nIridescent\nScales\nScales are going to be universal under the skin, except for when molting, having a skin condition, or discoloration due to age.\nGreen\nBrown\nTan\nCream\nBlack\nEyes\nThe Karnakians have two sets of eyes - one right behind the other. The first set of eyes is where you’d normally expect them to be on a raptor, with the second set being smaller, but opened “wider” - or at least, having that impression. The second set of eyes is also “fixed”, but is actually multi-directional; it literally doesn’t need to move because it’s FOV is so wide.\nThe first eye is for looking through the EM spectrum; Karnakians see just a little bit wider than Humans, but not by much.\nThe second, fused eye has the ability to “see the soul”. In reality, it’s more like “being able to detect electro-magnetic pulses that occur within other animals” and there is really no good description that they can give us to explain what that actually looks like\nYou could assume it’s that they can see an “aura”\nYou could assume it’s that they can see other sapients “glow”\nYou could even assume it’s that they can see your neurons/nerves firing off in a kaleidoscope of light and life\nPoint being, they can see something, but the big point here is that they can only see it in other sapient species. So, they can see it in us, Jornissian and Dorarizin - as well as each other - but not in your kitty. Srry bby.",

This is your more traditional viper-looking Jornissian, and yes - this means no breasts, flat chests for everybody.\nViper versus Python\nThere are both, calm down. Jornissians either hunt (traditionally) by venom or by constriction; both killing techniques are quick, but usually it’s an either-or. Rarely would you get one who has both traits, or can hunt both ways.\nViper-type Jornissians are going to have a more aggressive look and a sharper hood; triangles. Triangles everywhere. Think speed, think ferocity.\nPython-type Jornissians are going to have a less-aggressive look and a smaller, thinner hood; more circles. Think calculating as opposed to speed and antagonism.\nScale Color:\nScale color depends on the genetics of the parents and their climate, per usual. However, they’re ambush predators, and as such their patterns are going to be more geometric, more splotchy, and more standing-out-onboard-a-ship. \nGeometric like diamonds, circles, squares, triangles…. The list goes on.\nSplotchy - think like modern-day military camoflauge, ranging from large splotches of color to an integrated patchwork of scales. \nYou won’t have splotchy geometry; it’s almost always one or the other.\nJornissians will change scale color dependant on where they’ve lived for a few generations - but also whether or not their particular family line retains their potent venom\nMore Venemous Jornissians are going to be brighter - as a “do not eat me I am DANGER” response\nLess/Not Venemous Jornissians are going to be muted - to make it even easier to hide and strike from the shadows.\nColors:\nRed: Can be a main or accent color; anywhere from vibrant cherry to muted red clay.\nBlue: Can be a main or accent color; anywhere from sky-blue to ocean-blue.\nGreen: Can be a main or accent color: anywhere from emerald green to deep grass/shaded grass green.\nWhite: Usually an accent color, but can be a main in some circumstances; You’ll find white scales breaking up other colors in geometric patterns, but to have an all-white Jornissian is usually either (1) an albino or (2) an arctic-bred Jornissian, which is extremely rare. There’s cold and then there’s cold, in other words. \nBrown: Usually an accent color; used in scale patterns to add flow between deep colors such as red and green.\nBlack: Usually an accent color; used in place or in addition to white to break up other colors in geometric patterns.\nScale dyes/gene therapies are a thing, so in more urban and metropolitan areas you can get crazy combinations… like hot pink. \nEye Color: \nThey have a Diamond Iris; this tightens or expands based on available light, but does not go into a full reptilian-slit like what we’re used to. \nBlue\nGreen\nGold\nOrange\nRed\nSilver\nThe main point in all these colors is that they’re intense. They don’t blink like we do - their eyelid is basically under what we would consider the eye, and they just shed the lens cap when it gets old. Even in muted Jornissians (non-venemous) you’re going to have intense stares. \n\nJornissian (aka snek)\nPhysiology:\nMales and Females are roughly the same size\nMales have a more aggressive, pointed face. Both races have a flared hood - it’s under this hood where their temperature-sensing organs touch the skin. For a female’s hood, it’s more narrow and tapers down a little past their shoulders - a male’s hood is wider and ends at the shoulder. \nThis means that yes, they do have longer necks than you’d normally see on a species. \nThey can control their hood, flaring it out or pulling it tight\nMales and Females can initiate mating; it’s really “are the conditions right”. \nThey do shed skin when growing, but once they reach adulthood most shedding is over with; although they may shed from trauma (such as a scar or callous developing) full-body shedding is a thing of the past. They instead patch-shed, such as a scale or two here or there - much like Humans with dandruff. \nBlood: Green. Like an emerald. Deoxygenated is watery green.\nLanguage/Speaking: Jornissians hiss and purr, and most of the time mix the two. To the human ear, it sounds like they never take a breath between words, soit’sallonelongrun-onsentenceyanno? Purring can be anywhere from a light kitty-purr to a deep thrumming, and the hisses can do the entire range from deflating tire to busted-steam-pipe. There are consonants in there as well, and other sounds, but the dominant words of the day are as if a kitten sprung a steam leak. \nNames: Jornissian names follow their speech patterns, so it’s all said in one breath, with a ‘ breaking up the first and last names if they occur. So you can have ‘single name’ snakes such as Hsan or Eshhsan, and then firstname’lastname - such as Ashhs’ssk being a first-last name portmanteau. Usually you get the ‘ added to the name if there’s a lot of that one snake name around - like having 10 people in your department at work named “Bill”. Some might be Bill, William or Billiam - but you’re gonna have to start either going last-name, full name or a nickname. \nTo the Jornissians, the name for the Karnakian people is “The Spiritual Stargazers”. The Dorarizin are called “Clutchmate Seekers”. Jornissians sometimes call humans \"warmcuddles\" or \"warm-cuddles\".\nFamily Makeup: You have Houses which are made up of Clutches - Houses being the old-world equivalent of, well. Important family houses. Clutches are minor houses and family trees that sprung off from the main branch - and can be anywhere from an individual family to a large group, depending on how the House is arranged. Jornissians usually pair off in sets of 2 - Males and Females are usually equally birthed, so there’s no gender imbalance that would cause a larger family group. This means that you could have a Jornissian family of 2 who gave birth to a Clutch of eggs, and who themselves are within a Clutch. Jornissians give a soft-shell laying of anywhere between 5-15 eggs, with a 0%-20% amount of them being stillbirths/false eggs (think eggs not fertilized but caught up in the pregnancy hormones) which is a holdover from an evolutionary adaptation to a clutch-predator that is long-since extinct. Mom and Dad warm/hatch the eggs, and take turns carrying around their live children - who are very bitey. It’s not odd to see a new parent Jornissian with a couple children attached to their hood/neck/arms by the teeth - which is why one of the first garments ever invented was a baby-pocket-sash to stuff those little bastards in and keep them warm.\nSociety: Jornissians live within a federation of equals; think ancient rome. Voting is important, as is the power of consensus - debate is also highly encouraged and it’s not odd to see a rolling argument/conversation occur over days. There are, of course, sub-factions and independent nation-states, but as long as the patchwork is held together the Federation continues. \nHeat Sensing/Vision: The Jornissian’s have roughly two special powers, so to speak: The ability to see a wider EM spectrum that Humans, and their extreme sensitivity to temperature differentials. This means they’re very able and capable of hunting in the dark - either they can see you (as you’re partly in the infrared) or they can follow the overall “warm” sense to get ahold of you. \nReligious Deities:\nTons of ‘em. But a few that’ve been named:\nHarsak-who-devours-the-dead\nSotek-who-circles-the-world\nNressre-whose-eyes-are-the-moons\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"

          "content": "Karnakian (aka fluffdinos)\nPhysiology: \nMales and Females are roughly the same size.\nThink “Jurassic Park” Raptor when movement - arms tucked in before chest, tail used to counterbalance movement.\nAverage walking height for species at the shoulder is anywhere from 2-3M, however when they’re sitting down or “reared” back up they will be taller. \nMales and Females will have head crests and tail “fans”, as well as fans on the underside of their forearms. They can be flared out at will/subconsciously as part of their body language\nBlood: Purple. Deep royal hue, deoxygenated is lighter and weaker.\nLanguage/Speaking: Karnakian language is a mix of growls (like you’d expect from a dinosaur) and musical songbird notes. So it’s roaring-tweets; it can be beautiful and absolutely terrifying at the same time.\nCongretory Speaking: Since their language includes songbird notes, there is what’s called “congretory speaking” which is such an advanced form of communication that most translators just give up. There are entire segments of their language that are collaborative only and do not exist in the singular - where each individual approaches the “word” from a different way and the harmonics take off and a complex concept is spoken into being. This means that you can have one group song end in a “note” or “word” that in and of itself is an entire sermon or lecture or song.\nOld Tales speak of a legend that if every Karnakian spake at once they could say the true and full name of God. But it’s just a legend. \nNames: They have usually one name, Starting with growling or roaring consonants, and ‘ connoting musical notes. So Tk’ele or Rg’na’kit’ would be fine.  \nTo the Karnakians, the Dorarizin species name is “Noble-Family-Hunters-Yearning-For-Life”\nFamily Makeup: Karnakians have Families, which arrange into Tribes, which make up Flocks, which are what a Blessing is made of. Families are usually just the Karnakians who are blood-related; this could be anything from a Mother/Father to a Mother/Father + Kids + Grandparents and even extended relatives. There is no gender disparity, so equal work is given to both male and female when it comes to matters of the home and even matters of the heart - there’s no taboo for an aggressive female to hit on a male, and vice versa. Karnakians will lay between 3 and 7 hard shell eggs, all of them fertilized. The more eggs you lay, however, the smaller and weaker the individual chicks will be. Mom, Dad and other blood-related family will take turns nesting on the eggs until they hatch, wherepuon the whole family will make sure the next generation is raised properly. They will follow around the parents by the knees and ankles, and it’s not an uncommon sight to see a few chicks stuffed under a Karnakian parent’s “wing” to keep them warm and safe.\nSociety: Karnakians live within a Theocracy - as you do when since the dawn of recorded history you could see what you consider is the soul - which is a Diarchy. The actual Blessings - some spanning multiple star systems - are arranged in a divine-mandated federation; You are the bishop both because we voted you in and obviously because the Great Soul wanted you to have that position. They’re a mix between the Dorarizin Empire and the Jornissian Federation, if you want to look at it in a high level. \nSpecial Ability: Neural “Electrosensitivity” - They’re able to see (what we assume is) the condensed electrical activity in yo brain, son. Now this does not mean they can read your mind, or understand what you’re thinking, or track you through walls. Just that their second pair of fixed, unblinking eyes are able to see that you’re a thinking being - and hence, have a soul. It’s basically the reason why they’re all so religious; from prehistory until the modern day they can see your soul in your head. \nFurther Clarification: We call it “Neural Electrosensitivity” but we (and they) honestly don’t know why or how it works, and why there’s variances between karnakians in terms of strength or distance. It works to track the “souls” of sapient species - so your dog would not register, but it’s handler would. \n\nKarnakian\nThey did literally nothing wrong\nPhysical Characteristics:\nAnatomical Constants\nKarnakians are going to be around the same height as the Dorarizin - 2.3-3 meters tall - when they’re working/moving. As they have a raptor-like body, their tail helps them balance in their movement - so they’re tall but not at their full height when moving\nIf a Karnakian were to rear up to its full height, it would be a minimum of 2.6m tall.\nKarnakians will all have head-crest feathers, draping arm feathers (like the wings of a bird) and feathers along their body and tail.\nThey “flag” with their feathers sometimes to give nonverbal cues - can be emotional, actual sign-language, etc. \nClimate Adaptations\nCold Weather:\nF L U F F Y\nMore feathers, more down - they have the appearance of being bulked up, but most of that is actual featherweight. These guys will also have more feathers covering their body, and less scales - though, there will always be scales on the hands/claws, muzzle and feet.\nWarm Weather:\nLESS F L U F F Y\nYou’re going to see more scales, less feathers - in the extreme cases, no feathers at all except for a head-crest, arm-drapes and tailfeathers, though this is extremely rare. \nOverall, you’ll just see less feathers; they’re still filled with down and still have rows of them on their body, but wont’ be as “thicc” as the cold-weather adapted Karnakians\nFeathers\nPatterns\nKarnakians usually (but not always) have lighter feathers on their “underside”, under their tail and between their legs. Darker feathers are usually on their back and the rest of the body. \nMonocolor\nFading from quick to tip\nFading from tip to quick\nOutside of feather different color than underside\nSome Karnakians can be “spotted”, i.e. they have mottled feathers\nSome Karnakians can be “dressed”, i.e. their feathers will form patterns, such as a collar of light feathers around their neck, bright feathers on their ‘wings’ and tail but dull on the body, etc.\nColors\nWhite\nBlack, Gray\nGreen - Emerald, usually, though muted colors do exist\nYellow - Dull, sandy. Rarely the color of the sun\nBlue - bright, vibrant\nOrange - Dull, muted. More copper than Orange-orange.\nRed - Ruby to Blood\nIridescent\nScales\nScales are going to be universal under the skin, except for when molting, having a skin condition, or discoloration due to age.\nGreen\nBrown\nTan\nCream\nBlack\nEyes\nThe Karnakians have two sets of eyes - one right behind the other. The first set of eyes is where you’d normally expect them to be on a raptor, with the second set being smaller, but opened “wider” - or at least, having that impression. The second set of eyes is also “fixed”, but is actually multi-directional; it literally doesn’t need to move because it’s FOV is so wide.\nThe first eye is for looking through the EM spectrum; Karnakians see just a little bit wider than Humans, but not by much.\nThe second, fused eye has the ability to “see the soul”. In reality, it’s more like “being able to detect electro-magnetic pulses that occur within other animals” and there is really no good description that they can give us to explain what that actually looks like\nYou could assume it’s that they can see an “aura”\nYou could assume it’s that they can see other sapients “glow”\nYou could even assume it’s that they can see your neurons/nerves firing off in a kaleidoscope of light and life\nPoint being, they can see something, but the big point here is that they can only see it in other sapient species. So, they can see it in us, Jornissian and Dorarizin - as well as each other - but not in your kitty.\nKarnakians often call humans \"small-needs-protecting\", which is the term for humans in the Karnakian language."

          "content": "\nFur patterns & color/Eye colors:\nEye colors:\nThe cool spectrum of color\nPurple – Greweh’s is purple-gray\n Deep Blue\nNavy\nGreen\nAmber\nVibrant/bright colors are rare, usually it’s a softer color\nNOT pastel. Just muted.\nFur patterns:\nAlmost always two-toned. Single colors are rare\nColors tend to blend into each other and not be a straight border\nColors differ on “underside” of Dorarizin versus top; think along the lines of the difference between a white belly and a red back of a fox\nFur patterns are usually standard throughout the race, though which specific Dorarizin has what pattern is based on genetics (or gene therapy or dye)\nColoration changes around the muzzle\nColoration changes around the paws/feet\nTapered colorations around tail\nChange in fur color for ears (inside and out)\nColoration changes between “front/underside” and “back/top”\nFur Color\nAll fur color is to help them with hunting; their genetics aren’t going to allow them to go into bright or vibrant colors. That said, gene therapy and fur dyes are a thing, but….well. You’d just be the human equivalent of that one chick with the purple hair.\nDorarizin eventually will change their fur based on where they live/what planet type they hail from over the course of generations\n“Home” Dorarizin are mottled dark blue-grays, gray, dark green. Earthy colors, colors that help them hunt at dusk or dawn. Temperate/Tropic climates will also produce “Home” Dorarizin colors given time.\nDesert/Arid Dorarizin will get brown – deep browns, earthy clay red, muted brown-green colors. The red can be brighter than “Home” Dorarizin, but not like a fox’s vibrant red.\nArctic/Alpine Dorarizin will go shades of gray or dusk-blue to almost-white. They won’t have a pure-white fur color (unless albino), and fur patterns will stay the same.\nClaws\nDorarizin claws are a mixture of bio-available metals, calcium, chitin and keratin. It will retain some of the color of the fur – especially the pawfur – but is usually muddled with or tapers to a pure black. We’re talking, obsidian black.\nThey also can be shined; if it’s a “home” dorarizin, they can get to a mirror polish due to the darkness of the claws. Most other sub-races would just get them shiny for formal events – or historically to prove that they don’t do manual labor and can afford such a luxury.\n\nDorarizin (aka doggo)\nPhysiology:\nMales are smaller than Females, but will still be no smaller than 2.8-3m. \nMales also have a “mane” of fur around their neck and head, but it is by no means a hair analogue; think more like something laying across their neck and upper back.\nFemales are larger and stronger than Males, and also have a stronger scent-drive\nMales go into heat/rut; Females don’t. Therefore, Males are only fertile for certain seasons, whereas females are fertile all the time.\nTeeth and Claws molt. Not all at once, but much like a shark; you’ll see them pull a loose tooth or claw out every so often. It happens less and less the older the Dorarizin in question becomes\nBlood: Blue. Like a hermit crab’s blood.\nLanguage/Speaking: The Dorarizin have canine mouths, but have the ability to “click” their teeth together - up to the speed of a dolphin’s clicks. Therefore their language integrates both growling and clicking within their normal speech. \nNames: The naming convention always goes “Firstname-of-Packname” for the females, and “Firstname-of-Man’sClanName” for the males. \nAll male clan names start with “A”. No female will have an “A” last name, ever. \nTitles go before first names, so it’ll be Title-Firstname-of-******, but the title basically becomes a second first name. They’re never without the honorific. \nFor the Dorarizin, the Karnakian species name is “Eternal-All-Lights-Within”. For Jornissians, “Forever-Free-Trail-Makers.” Dorarizin call humans \"tiny chompers,\" as this is the term for humans in the Dorarizin language.\nHome world is the “Hunt-of-Good-Lands”\nParental titles are used/dropped with context:\nMa is a title spoken by children, prefixed “nk”.\nPa is a title spoken by children, prefixed “xktk”\nYour own son/daughter would call you “dad”, but would say “Xktk-[firstname-of-lastname]” if they were talking to someone else about you.\nYour packsibling would call their own mom “mom” but would call another mom “nk-[firtstname]”. Dad is everyone’s dad, so he’s just dad.\nWives refer to each other with the prefix “zni”\nHusbands just call the wives their normal names cause they’re the alpha male what did you expect get out of my kitchen woman I have like 30 pups to wrassle into the space school bus in the next 5 minutes-\nFamily Makeup: You have Tribes, which are made up of Clans, which are made up of Packs. Back when they were a single-planet species, Tribes were nation-states and were very important - nowadays, not so much. Clans are more extended family, and it’s here where most familiar power within Dorarizin society is concentrated. There are more females than males - to the tune of 3-5::1. This means that Dorarizin usually form family “packs”, with the larger females leading the den. Once pregnancies happen, the males are usually left to manage the pups after they’ve been weaned; Each female in turn gets pregnant from Alpha down, and each female can give a live birth of anywhere between 3 - 8 pups per litter. Dorarizin dads are #1, is what I’m basically saying. \nScenting: Scent is extremely important to a Dorarizin; it can tell them anything from a fellow packmate’s mood to their age or if they have any sicknesses to them being in season. \nA Male’s scent drive is not as strong as a Females, for \nA newborn pup needs to smell of Mom because back in the day it may not have been the only pup around in the tribe, and parents needed to tell them apart. Birth back then was also not easy (murdermachines, remember?) So making sure the pups that DID survive birth survived the following months/years was super important.A scentless pup is neglected at best and abandoned at worst. As the pupper grows it's own scent starts to dominate over the mother's gifted scent, and then you're just another doggo in the pack.\nSociety: Dorarizin live by and large within an Empire, but as to exactly how much power the Empire flexes depends on where you are in the territory. There are, of course, sub-factions and independent nation-states as well. Hierarchy is important, but not inflexible - if you prove yourself you can move to a higher status position. \nThe Empire’s seat of power is literally called “The Throne-at-The-Center-of-All-Things”\n\n"

          "content": "The Frontrooms is what would be considered the baseline 'reality', as it is where the human species originated from, and thus what we're all familiar with.\nThe Frontrooms, also known as The Universe, is the juxtaposition of the Backrooms; a parallel Dimension that, while seemingly similar at face value, is full of many contrasting subtleties.\nLike the Backrooms, the Frontrooms is a Dimension of infinite size divided into an infinite amount of distinct regions, called Galaxies. However, the Frontrooms vastly differs from the Backrooms in the following metrics:\nStability - it is considered far stable than the Backrooms, as geometry is by default completely linear.\nConsistency - no Galaxy or area in between Galaxies is dramatically different than any other region.\nFuzziness of distinct regions - unlike Levels in the Backrooms, Galaxies oftentimes have no well-defined boundary. Instead, they are spread or smeared over vast regions of space, with only a few more solid parts near their center.\nIntra-dimensional travel - unlike the Backrooms, noclipping does not allow travel across different regions, nor travel in one region. Instead, noclipping in the Frontrooms can only lead to the Backrooms.\nScale - it is almost incomparably larger. A single Galaxy can be as large as 1023 meters in radius. Likewise, Galaxies can be as far as 1027 meters apart. This, along with the sheer impotence of noclipping, makes travel nightmarishly sluggish at best; practically impossible at worst.\nDepth - In the Backrooms, space is divided into clusters, then levels, then sublevels, then locations/areas. However, in the Frontrooms, space is divided into structures, then three separate tiers of clusters, then galaxies/dwarf galaxies, then star systems, then celestial bodies, and then locations/areas. In practice, this means the Frontrooms is far more complicated than the Backrooms as a dynamic system.\nEarth is a large, habitable terrestrial planet in the star system Sol[4]. Earth currently houses ~10.521 billion humans, in addition to innumerably many of countless other species. Earth is also the first and currently only planet in the Frontrooms to host life, having had lifeforms first arise billions of years ago. Earth has a diameter of 12.7 thousand kilometers, a surface area of 510 million square kilometers, a mass of 6*1024 kilograms, and a gravitational acceleration of 9.81m/s2 at the surface.\nThe Sun is a star and Earth's dominant light and heat source, with a habitable zone in the range of roughly 140-200 million kilometers away from the surface of the star. The Sun is 150 million kilometers away from Earth, is 1.39 million kilometers in diameter, 6 trillion kilometers in surface area, 333 thousand Earths equivalent in mass, and a luminosity of 4*1026 watts. The Solar system, its star system, possesses multiple other planets similar to Earth and otherwise, along with countless smaller celestial bodies.\nThe Milky Way is a spiral Galaxy containing hundreds of billions of stars, including The Sun and its system. It is the second largest Galaxy in the Local Group. The Milky Way has a diameter of 90 thousand light years, an average thickness of a few thousand light years, and a mass equivalent to 1.1 trillion Suns. About 90% of this mass is dark matter, a form of matter that only interacts via gravity. It is considered that this form of matter is entirely unique to the the Frontrooms"

          "content": "Level 0 is the first level of the Backrooms, and the first location that most entering from baseline reality will find themselves in. \nLevel 0 is an expansive non-Euclidean space resembling the back rooms of a dated retail outlet. The level is known most prominently for its disorienting layout and distinct yellowed wallpaper. All rooms in Level 0 share the same superficial features, with worn, moist carpeting, scattered electrical outlets, and inconsistently placed fluorescent lighting. Aside from these qualities, no two rooms in the level are the same, with each area differing significantly in shape and layout.\nThe constant hum-buzz emitted by the ceiling lights permeates every area of Level 0, being notably louder and more obtrusive than ordinary fluorescent lighting. The buzz tends to induce throbbing migraines in most individuals, which persist for an extended period of time even after one has exited the level. As the level is devoid of hostile threats, the only danger that Level 0 poses is the evident lack of available resources, as many fall victim to dehydration, exhaustion, or starvation.\nLinear space and topology are significantly altered within Level 0, with it being possible to walk in a straight line, return to the starting point, and end up in a different set of rooms than one was in beforehand. Such properties cause the level to be extremely disorienting in layout, with research suggesting that the confusion may be the underlying cause of loss of mental stability among individuals. Due to the barren layout and confounding structure of Level 0, some individuals report experiencing intense visual and auditory hallucinations—with rare cases reporting wanderers descending into \"utter lunacy\" as a result of the level's properties.\nA small space, around one meter in height, lies above the drop ceiling of Level 0. Scattered around the cramped ceiling space are wires, electrical fixtures, and ventilation ducts, though these are generally unnavigable as the sheer amount of dust renders the air unbreathable.\nThe Manila Room:\nThe Manila Room is an isolated spatial anomaly within Level 0, notable for its distinctive appearance from the rest of the level. While sharing certain features with Level 0, such as the moist carpeting and loud fluorescent lighting, it has a distinctive manila pattern dotting its walls, from which many have reported experiencing a soothing feeling. The singular overhead light within the room is significantly duller than the surrounding level, possessing a noticeable orange tint. It is possible for the Manila Room to appear anywhere throughout Level 0, serving as a rudimentary resting point for wanderers who may come across it.\nThe Manila Room serves as one of the few consistent exit points from Level 0, as remaining in it for an extended period of time has been reported to lead into either Level 1 or Level 2. Being near the room, one may experience a dulling of the senses, with many wanderers unknowingly wandering into the room as a result. In addition, some individuals have described a faint, disquieting whispering noise emanating from behind the walls, though it is speculated that this may be a result of common auditory hallucinations. The Manila Room also reportedly experiences occasional blackouts, though it is speculated that certain underlying causes may be at fault.\n\nEntrances:\nThe most commonplace entrance into Level 0 is via The Frontrooms, as this is the place where a majority of wanderers begin their journey. In addition, a wide variety of levels can lead one here.\nExits:\nAs of the current date, Level 0 contains five properly documented exits:\nWandering far and long enough, which may cause the hallways to gradually transition into Level 1's garages;\nBreaking through a wall, which will lead one into Level 139;\nBreaking through the floor, which may lead one to Level 27, seldom The Void;\nEntering a rare emergency exit, which may lead one to Level 14;\nAnd glass sliding doors resemblant of those within a greenhouse, which lead one to Level 13."

          "content": "Level 0.01, more commonly known as the \"The Exit?,\" is a sublevel of Level 0 appearing as a presumably endless labyrinth of long, mundane hallways; every corridor is superficially consistent, adorned with dull yellow wallpaper, moist carpet, and spaced fluorescent lights. Though retaining a common theme, each corridor is subtly unique (i.e., a slight change in the atmosphere, sudden protuberances from the wall, minuscule changes in the floor's angle, and so forth). Navigation is strictly limited by chance, as hallways seemingly change once a wanderer breaks eye contact.\nThe lighting system of Level 0.01 is relatively poor, habitually flickering and sometimes shutting off entirely. Furthermore, these panels negatively impact one's mental health; staring into the light for extended periods may cause mental disorientation, deterioration of rationalization, et cetera. The panels' hum has been reported to cause a nullification of one's sensory organs; this effect can be temporarily negated with Almond Water.\nThroughout Level 0.01, random objects can be found, such as empty bottles, tattered shoes, broken flashlights, and so forth. However, currently, no two living beings have directly come into contact. Furthermore, all lines of contact immediately cut off upon entry, inconveniencing documentation of the level's properties.\nNumerous accounts have described a gradual deterioration in the level's quality as they wander farther into the ceaseless depths, depicting a consistent increase in lighting failures, broken walls, and a metallic odor. Additionally, visual and auditory hallucinations begin to increase as one's mental health falters over time. This includes the manifestation of false exits, misplaced doors, nonexistent figures, et cetera. After a certain point, exploring further into Level 0.01 may become infeasible for a variety of reasons.\nAside from physical hazards, Level 0.01 also possesses a variety of environmental hazards. The air is extremely damp and humid, resulting in uncomfortably hot temperatures. A low fog—composed of water vapor and faint traces of Almond Water—drags across the wet carpet, obscuring a wanderer's vision as they traverse Level 0.01. As one journeys further into the level, conditions will worsen as the air gets more muggy and visibility decreases.Some wanderers have reported that after passing a long distance in level 0.01, the surroundings of this level begin to show some serious damage, such as cracked floors and walls.The following table provides Level 0.01's environmental statistics:\n\"0 kilometers (0 miles)\n25 degrees Celsius (77 degrees Fahrenheit)\n[N/A]\n5 kilometers (3.1 miles)\n30 degrees Celsius (86 degrees Fahrenheit)\nLights flicker more often\nFog thickens; visibility still possible\n13 kilometers (8 miles)\n35 degrees Celsius (95 degrees Fahrenheit)\nBlackouts become more common\nFog thickens; visibility mildly inconvenienced\nTorn wallpaper becomes more common\nSigns of previous habitation decrease\n21 kilometers (13 miles)\n36 degrees Celsius (97 degrees Fahrenheit)\nBlackouts become more common\nFog reaches maximum concentration; visibility greatly reduced\nIncrease of missing light panels\nHallway layout becomes more inconsistent\n31 kilometers (19 miles)\n40 degrees Celsius (104 degrees Fahrenheit)\nLights flicker rapidly\nTemperatures reaches maximum value\nFog swirls more aggressively\nHallway layout becomes increasingly dilapidated\"\nLevel 0.01's properties are anything but beneficial. Wanderers who enter Level 0.01 are separated from all other lifeforms, and they are incapable of dying from starvation and terminal dehydration. Matter brought into the level will have their colors slowly fade to match the level's dull yellows. However, if Almond Water is applied to the affected areas, it can reverse the effects.\nEntrances:\nA concrete door labeled with \"EXIT\" in green neon letters leads to Level 0.01.\nExtremely long hallways in Level 0 where the lights around start to flicker lead to Level 0.01.\nWhen you try a noclip at Level 0, there is a very small chance of entering Level 0.01.\nExits:\nHoles in the floor lead to The Void.\nSome lights have crawlspaces above them. Entering this area leads to Level 28. Once a person climbs into the crawlspace, they cannot return to Level 0.01.\nDue to the level's stability deteriorating as one goes further in, it is theoretically possible to noclip out after a certain distance."

          "content": "Level 0.23 of the Backrooms is a sublevel of Level 0, more commonly known as \"Half Finished\". The level is made up of offices that look as though they are in a factory, with the appearance of the Alone phenomenon making it so that it is impossible to find any other explorers on the level. The level has a similar design to Level 0; however, it has scattered windows and appears to be under construction. Some of the windows look out to just a wall, others look out into a bright blue sky that seems to be computer-generated.\nSince the level is under construction, there are hazards present, including the collapse of ceilings/floors, ventilation, or lights going out. The perceived height is different for everyone, with some people reporting five floors, others reporting two, and even one. This also affects the perceived dangers; if someone only sees one floor, there would be no possibility of a collapse from the ceiling or floor.\nThis level appears not to have been disturbed for an extremely long time. It contains open cans, mouldy bread, dust, and various other abandoned objects. It is almost identical to Level 0.22, which leads some explorers to believe that the two levels may have been connected at one point in time but have split for unknown reasons.\nEntities:\nClouds are something that can be seen outside the widows, floating in the sky. These clouds are exceptionally hostile and invasive. Disturbingly, if you make eye contact for a couple of seconds, they start to distort your very perception in strange, otherworldly ways. For a time, you might find yourself reliving the very best moments of your life— memories flooding your input processor—shadows from the past whispering in your ear; a familiar smell flows around you and reminds you of people, places, long gone, that you felt joy with. Soft, lyrical music might play and stir within you vaguely, a long-ago happening; the longing for something or someone that could be felt or heard from so long ago suddenly returned.\nWhat you don't realize is that this beautiful, remembered moment is a trap for you. While you are entranced by the clouds, all the while your body rots from the inside out. Your lifeforce leaks away slowly, imperceptibly, and with it the world around you warps, distorts, and ultimately fades. The longer you stare at the clouds, the more the grasp on your reality becomes frayed. Eventually, after what feels like an eternity, the last thing you will remember will be the eyes of the clouds, cold, leaking into your perception as they blinked away, and then nothing; no sound, no sensation.\nIt is theorized that the bodies that are left behind are no longer composed of flesh but instead turn to dust or disappear completely, as though they never existed.\nEntrances and Exits\nEntrances:\nRarely, finding a door on Level 0 labeled \"Next Project\" will lead you here.\nEntering a building that is under construction on Level 11 or Level 111 will bring one to this level.\nVarious unknown factors in Level 0.22 may lead here.\nExits:\nGoing through an exit door will lead you to Level 27 or back to Level 0.\nVarious unknown factors may lead back to Level 0.22."

          "content": "Level 0.5, also known as the “Chaotic Structure”, is a sublevel of Level 0.\nLevel 0.5 consists of an endless series of randomly segmented cubic/rectangular solids, all completely covered in carpets in varying shades of blue. The composition of these solids is unknown, as the carpet seems to be unbreakable, but they are believed to be made out of some kind of metal.\nNotably, most carpets have straight black lines of varying thicknesses. All lines are parallel to the edge of the solid they are on and often have gaps. It is believed these gaps contain hidden messages but attempts to translate them have failed (with one exception).\nWhile on the level, gravity only applies when on the face of a solid and pulls one \"down\" onto the face. Interestingly, one will always be pulled \"down\", regardless of which face they are on, allowing one to walk on all sides of a solid (including the “bottom”). Jumping between solids is possible, as there is no gravity while in midair.\nMore ceaseless carpeted cubes. \nAll solids within the level are suspended in a light blue fog, which seemingly stretches on infinitely. This fog restricts vision to 10-100 feet depending on its thickness. Notably, the fog seems to dissipate depending on how far up a person travels, although it never disappears entirely. The fog also seems to be the light source for this level, with a soft white light emanating from it constantly.\nThe fog seems to be a mixture of water and Almond Water, but, though it retains the taste of Almond Water, the concentration of Almond Water within the fog is incredibly small, making it necessary to inhale large amounts for the Almond Water to begin having an effect. It is only possible to inhale the fog while not on solid ground.\nTime is strange here—one may feel hungry one moment and the next feel full despite never eating. In addition, one's sense of time drastically varies, ranging from thinking one has been in the level for just seconds to hours. There is no way to keep time while here—there is no day/night cycle, or even anything resembling it, nor do people feel tired while at this level. One's senses of distance and direction are also altered here, making it impossible to travel in a straight line.\nMany objects can be found within the level, mostly related to tabletop games, such as chess pieces, puzzle pieces, and dice. Attempting to pick up any object in the level (including ones brought in) will still work, although the size of objects changes based on perspective.\nThe Floating Lobby\nIf one travels far enough in this level, the level will begin to resemble Level 0. The carpet will slowly transition from shades of blue to a uniform gray and will become increasingly moist, while the lines within the carpet will disappear. The color of the fog will shift to a yellow, resembling the infamous wallpaper of Level 0. Interestingly, Qwerty (a level-exclusive entity) can still appear here, despite Level 0 having no entities.\nIt is believed that, if one travels far enough in this area, the transition to Level 0 will become complete, and one will be transported to Level 0. However, this is unconfirmed. \nEntities\nOne level-exclusive entity, known as \"Qwerty\", has been discovered.\nEntrances:\nLevel 0.5 can only be accessed through \"cutoffs\" within Level 0. These \"cutoffs\" appear to be regular hallways/rooms of Level 0 cut in half by a large wall mirror, which completely blocks off the rest of the hallway or room. If one attempts to interact with, walk through, or no-clip through the mirror, they will fall through the floor. While falling, they will see a kaleidoscope of Level 0 transitioning into Level 0.5. Interestingly, entering Level 0.5 can take anywhere from seconds to days.\nAs of right now, it is believed these \"cutoffs\" occur when a \"glitch\" occurs within Level 0, or a portion of it somehow noclips onto itself.\nExits:\nNo stable exits to this level have been found. However, there are unconfirmed and unstable ones:\nIt is theorized that, if one travels far enough in the Floating Lobby, they will be transported back to Level 0.\nSeveral wanderers have reportedly been able to escape through a variety of means, such as finding an oddly colored pillar, falling asleep or floating in the fog for a long period of time. However, none of these exits are stable."

          "content": "Level 0.67, often referred to as \"The Cold Lobby,\" is a sub-level between Level 0 and Level 1.\nAlthough Level 0.67 shares a very similar appearance to Level 0, there are key differences between the two. Firstly, Level 0.67 has inconsistent geometry, with walls shifting and reorienting themselves haphazardly. It is currently unknown what causes the walls to move, but because of this, traversing the level is very difficult, and due to the nature of the laser measuring instruments normally used, it is impossible to map out or measure this level. Additionally, the level is incredibly cold, with temperatures averaging approximately -89°C (-128.2°F) throughout the entire level. This makes the level almost uninhabitable, (unless you are sufficiently equipped to handle the harsh temperatures of Level 0.67,) and causes a myriad of conditions, which include but are not limited to: chilblains, frostbite, and hypothermia. Finally, the level has a generally blue tint that engulfs the entire level, save for the Twilight Zone, which will be further elaborated on.\nThe Stationary Period:\nThis is a period of time, usually lasting only 3 to 5 seconds, where all of the walls stop moving. These time periods are completely random, with no discernible logic to the timing between the pauses in movement. If a wall is in mid-motion and is clipping into another wall, ceiling, or floor, the wall will simply return to an unclipped position as though it never moved, only to snap back to that position or rotation as soon as the period is over.\nThe Active Period:\nAs implied, this is the period of time in which all walls are jutting around the level and moving haphazardly with no sense whatsoever. To this day, it is unknown what causes the walls to move. Measurements have revealed that a wall can spin up to 265° along the X, Y or Z axis, also being able to move along up to two of these axes at any given time, (there were [REDACTED] fatalities during measurements). The walls have also been measured to move up to 9 inches in any direction, ignoring the ceiling and floor of the level, and any other walls.\nThe Twilight Zone:\nThe Twilight Zone is an interesting region of Level 0.67. This area is a zone that can be found anywhere within the level and is very large in volume, (though, due to the geometrical instabilities, the exact size of this zone is unknown). The area is pitch black and absorbs any light sources that a wanderer tries to use. This dark effect is only visible from within the region, making it impossible to avoid accidentally walking into it. It is recommended to turn and walk in the opposite direction the moment you accidentally enter, to avoid any encounters with the Lurker.\nLevel 0.67 is home to a single entity, that being the Lurker. This entity is native to Level 0.67 and there have been no confirmed sightings of it within any other level.\nColonies and Outposts:\nThis level is devoid of colonies and outposts. There are many reasons for this, which are as follows:\nThe method of entrance is very complicated, making it impractical to establish a human colony within this level.\nLevel 0.67 contains absolutely no resources that a wanderer can utilize. Additionally, nothing can be grown in this level due to the level's harsh temperatures. Moreover, the temperature of the level makes it almost impossible to live in for a prolonged period of time. There can never be more than one person inside Level 0.67 at any given time. In the case that a wanderer attempts to enter the level whilst someone is already in it, they will simply be sent to another instance of the level. This makes human interaction impossible on the level.\nEntrances:\nTo enter Level 0.67, you must follow very specific instructions, which are as follows:\nFind a vent within Level 0. Enter, and begin crawling through it.\nAfter an unknown amount of time, the vent will experience a temperature drop. This drop will be noticeable no matter what protective gear you wear.\nOnce the temperature drop occurs, begin crawling in the opposite direction for 0.5 miles. It makes no difference how far you travelled upon entry, it will always be 0.5 miles on the reverse journey\nAfter you have crawled 0.5 miles in reverse, you will no-clip through the floor of the vent and end up in a room with two doors labelled COLD and HOT\nYou must go through the door labelled COLD. Once you do, you will be sent to a random location within Level 0.67.\nFailure to complete any of these steps correctly will send you to an unknown location. No wanderer that failed to complete these steps was ever heard from again, therefore it is advised to be as careful as possible if you plan to go to this level.\nAs there have been no other documented or confirmed methods of entry into the level, you should not try to attempt any alternative entry methods.\nExits:\nTo exit Level 0.67, you can attempt to no-clip through a wall during the stationary period of the level. Successfully no-clipping in this scenario will send you to a random level between Level 2 and Level 41. There have been unconfirmed reports of people exiting Level 0.67 and ending up in the Hub, but the validity of these claims is unknown."

          "content": "Level 0.7, colloquially referred to as the “Dark Lobby” or \"The Squeeze\" is a sub-level of Level 0. While it shares many similarities with Level 0, such as its non-euclidean geometry and general appearance, it differs from it in many aspects. A notable difference is the lack of isolating effects present in Level 0, making travel in groups possible, although not recommended. The most noticeable difference is that Level 0.7 has no lights. You should have a flashlight, but it will likely go out after 6 minutes due to the properties of the Level. The walls and carpet are completely covered grime and mold, as opposed to Level 0's, which are in mostly pristine condition. Due to this, the smell of the level is an \"unbearable stench,\" adding to Level 0.7's uninhabitable conditions. Another notable difference from Level 0's walls is their average height. They appear to be approximately half the height of the walls found in Level 0.\nLevel 0.7 mainly consists of noticeably narrow hallways -- approximately quarter the width of the ones found in Level 0. Being the most common structure, wanderers may frequently encounter interconnected hallways spanning kilometers.\nThe less common type of structure in Level 0.7 is a room, similar to the ones found in Level 0. They serve as intersections of sorts, connecting three hallways. Doors commonly found in rooms lead to further hallways. Derelict furniture can frequently be found in larger rooms, appearing to be a natural part of the level, although not serving any obvious purpose.\nThere is a seemingly random chance for useful objects in low amounts such as Almond Water, cellphones, flashlights, or various industrial objects to be found in rooms, although harmful objects, mainly Cashew Water, may also be found.\n\nThe Flickering:\nThe Flickering (Not to be confused to The Flicker) is an common event that occurs erratically in Level 0.7. The event usually affects an area of roughly one football pitch (69,330 square feet or 6,438 square meters), according to wanderers' accounts.\nWhen the event begins, lightbulbs will appear hanging from the ceiling, illuminating the area. It is recommended to leave the area immediately after this happens or seek cover, under the derelict furniture for example, if leaving isn't possible. After approximately three minutes, all functioning light sources in the area, including artificial ones such as flashlights, will start to consistently flicker at an increasing speed, starting from 10 seconds down to an unrecordably small interval.\nThe constant turn-on and turn-off cycle at such rapid rates will cause the lightbulb in any light source to overheat and burst with a small explosive force. The glass of the bulb, propelled by the explosion of the lightbulbs suspended from the ceiling, can result in debilitating injuries, which could ultimately lead to death.\nDo:\nLeave the affected area immediately.\nIf leaving the area is impossible, take cover before the lights start flickering at dangerous rates.\nRemove all power sources from your artificial light sources if possible.\nDon't:\nTake cover in a position where your vital areas could be damaged.\nDestroy your artificial light sources unless necessary. They are vital for navigating the level.\n\nEntities:\nSmilers - Primarily around larger rooms, as they tend to contain less functional ceiling lights.\nClumps - Primarily in halls, due to their width.\nSkin-Stealers - Primarily in rooms, although rare.\nHounds - Majority of the level.\nClaims for further entities to be present at the level have been made, although these claims do not correlate with other wanderers' reports. Regardless, wanderers should be prepared to face any given common entity, as this list is almost definitely incomplete.\n\nColonies and Outposts:\nThere have been no successful attempts at establishing a colony or outpost on Level 0.7.\nM.E.G. - 0.7 Temporary Research Outpost\nA team of three M.E.G. researchers and one security guard deployed to research the aforementioned theorized disappearing effects of Flickering debris.\nDeployed with improvised protective equipment against the dangers posed by The Flickering, as well as construction materials used to seal off a designated area to create a secure home base.\nThe team established the outpost in a room containing a door reportedly leading to Level 1, where it planned to access The Hub, handing off the collected data at the M.E.G. base in Level 4, which the head researcher was deployed with a key to.\nThe team failed to send out a ping to the home base at the final stages of the mission, around the day when the team should have attempted to exit the level.\nTheories regarding what happened to the team have arisen, however, nothing definite has been proven.\nUnknown Group - Territory Garrison\nA defunct permanent outpost, active for around two weeks.\nServed as a \"garrison\" for the first territory of an unnamed \"empire that will soon rival the size of the M.E.G.\" based in Level 20, although no primary base for this group has ever been found.\nMembers established the outpost equipped with day-to-day essentials and a small arsenal of improvised weaponry.\nOutpost situated around a medium-sized room and the neighboring hallways, \"claim\" outlined by black tape.\nHoused three people, implied by the sleeping bag count.\nOutpost theorized to have dissolved following one of its members entering the reconstruction stages of the Hound Virus, implied by blood and teeth found on the room's floor.\n\nEntrances:\nA \"Y\" shaped, dimly lit corridor in Level 0 will lead to Level 0.7.\nCertain areas of Level 28 may lead to Level 0.7.\nDoors in Level 1.01 may lead to Level 0.7.\nUnconfirmed reports of wanderers rarely entering Level 0.7 via sleeping on cabin floors in Level 410 have emerged, do so at your own risk.\n\n\nExits:\nEntering a door may lead to Level 1.01, Level 0, Level 1, or Level 27.\nA staircase in a room will lead to a house basement in Level 9.\nEntering a hallway with progressively fewer ceiling lights may lead to Level 6.

          "content": "Invaded by large swathes of chilling waters at varying depths, Level 0.8 stands as a perilous sublevel of Level 0. While the flood may be the most characteristic offshoot of the sublevel, other differences include lower temperatures, missing ceiling tiles, a quieter fluorescent humming noise or lack thereof, sizable sections of the level lacking illumination, and infestive mold growth on the walls. Not all rooms in the sublevel are level to one another, causing the water level between rooms to vary significantly. On either extremes of the variance, one room may be dry and another may be fully submerged. Level 0.8 is one of the few sublevels affected by Phenomenon 24, and is the first documented instance of the phenomenon throughout the Backrooms.\nUnlike its parent level, one can meet other wanderers in Level 0.8. Other wanderers are an uncommon sight if one traverses enough, although the nature of Level 0.8 impedes all traversal efforts. Non-Euclidean geometry is also absent in the sublevel, easing travel and cohesion in understanding the layout. The lack of both phenomena paved the way for the establishment of small research outposts, though the only incentive was to understand more about Phenomenon 24 and how it affects the level. Such interest in Level 0.8 has dwindled over time due to increased understanding of both the phenomenon and sublevel, and the few research outposts remain abandoned, swept and eroded away by the waters they ought to unravel.\nRubble left unattended by previous inhabitants litter and dot the flooded sublevel. They can be found either in clusters floating on water or chaotically strewn about submerged. There is no rhyme or reason to the rubbish that remains submerged, yet clusters of abandoned objects above hint at the settlements the sublevel has seen throughout its history. Supplies like Almond Water are absent on Level 0.8, though one's ingenuity may result in using the objects for survival in Level 0.8, including constructing small rafts and makeshift melee weapons.\nStrangely, the temperatures of the water and the air above juxtapose one another significantly, with the temperature of air in Level 0.8 averaging 35°C, while the water remains at a chilling 2°C. Water vapor is common in the sublevel's air, creating a moist environment suitable for mold to grow on surfaces, damaging them, leading to open holes in the ceiling and missing chunks in the walls. Water in Level 0.8 cannot freeze despite the low temperatures, which gradually decrease the further one descends into them.\nOne may find large regions of the sublevel shrouded in darkness. These are most often lower-elevation regions of Level 0.8, though these dark zones may persist in drier regions. Most of the lower lying areas lack illumination aside from occasional flickers. Dark zones are a common sight in Level 0.8, and they are large enough that one can only see pitch blackness even in more open regions. Lighting in areas which surround the dark zones are prone to random malfunctions such as flickering, to which some believe that the dark zones are slowly expanding and will encompass all of Level 0.8 far in the future.\n\nEntities:\nThe first of the two entities are Spines. They inhabit the upper air-exposed regions of Level 0.8. While they can survive being submerged, the relatively low temperatures of the water prevents them from doing so and prolonged exposure to such an environment is lethal. The second, and more common of the two, are the Needlelimbs, thriving in cold, dark waters. They are an offshoot of the main entity adapting to survive in water, growing fins and exuding behaviors closer to fish than their primary counterpart.\nMicroorganisms are unsurprisingly present within Level 0.8, such as the Hydrolitis Plague, which are uncommon in the level, mainly found on smaller pools of water in the sublevel. However, a fungi, endemic to the sublevel, dominates its cold waters and humid atmosphere.\n\nEntrances:\nNoclipping through a hallway with leaking pipes in Level 268 sends one here;\nImmersing oneself within a swimming pool in Level 5 will lead one here;\nFalling asleep on one of the beds in Level 5.1 might lead one here;\nNoclipping through a submerged stalactite in Level 8 might lead one here;\nA blue door in Level 15 will lead here;\nNoclipping through water tanks within a factory in Level 503 will lead one here;\nDiving in shallower lakes in Level 339 will lead one here;\nNoclipping through a fountain in Level 405 will lead one here.\n\nExits:\nA rusty ladder leads back to Level 0;\nFinding a life float and wearing it sends one to Level 194;\nNoclipping through religious paintings in which deities are scribbled in black sends one to Level 106;\nNoclipping through a patch of pool tiles sends one to Level 37;\nRarely, one may encounter an upward staircase leading to a dry attic-like room. Noclipping in that room sends one to The Attic;\nNoclipping through a concrete wall sends one to Level 1;\nNoclipping through an anomalously cold room containing ice sends one to Level 797."

          "content": "Level 0.99, known as the \"Deeper Regions\", is a volatile, dangerous and structurally unsound sub-level of Level 0.\nLevel 0.99 heavily resembles its parent level in appearance; it has the same mono-yellow wallpaper, moist carpet, and buzzing lights. What makes Level 0.99 different — and, subsequently, so dangerous — is its unstable structure.\nWhen entering Level 0.99, one will immediately notice an obvious lack of standard architecture. The floor, ceiling, and walls are all at odd, misaligned heights, making travel through the sub-level extremely difficult. The floor is mostly made up of rounded square lumps that are arbitrarily elevated, while the walls occasionally overhang areas of the ceiling, protrude at odd angles, or are not even long enough to span between the floor and the ceiling. The area resembles a poorly computer-generated 3D world (see Research Log 1).\nThis is not the case in some regions of the level, but for the most part, the design is nonsensical and occasionally inhibits progress entirely in the form of dead ends or bottomless pits. Level 0.99, like Level 0, is seemingly indestructible.\nTraversing the sub-level is further made difficult by the fact that it is a non-Euclidean space like its parent level. No wanderer has ever left due to its highly confusing layout—either getting lost and dying of starvation or thirst or being lured into the Nucleus (see Nucleus). In addition, the scrambling compass effect present in most levels is extremely heightened within Level 0.99- reports state that compasses brought into the sublevel would heat up to the point of being unusable, either breaking or becoming too hot to safely hold.\nWhile the majority of the sublevel resembles a jumbled version of Level 0, there are some anomalies (albeit the entire sublevel may be called an oddity). These abnormal locations become more common as one travels closer to the Nucleus. They can include high walls, ridiculously huge rooms, and numerous holes in the walls that lead to darkness. Carpeted chutes are frequently used to connect these areas.\nAs previously mentioned, the height between the floor(s) and ceiling(s) can vary wildly due to the level's unique structure, ranging from a recorded low of 4ft to a high of approximately 500ft.\nWhile the rooms appear to be haphazardly mixed, they are actually ordered in a unique sequence spreading out from the Nucleus. Because of the non-Euclidean features of the sublevel, the exact pattern has yet to be discovered, but one is unmistakably present. The map above was computer generated using sonar data from drones.\nThere are not any items in Level 0.99, even furniture, therefore, looking for supplies here is pointless. Surprisingly, one's sanity does not appear to be jeopardized while in this sublevel; hence, Almond Water is not required. If a wanderer is on the verge of becoming an Insanity, accessing this level will gradually heal them (further research into this phenomenon is needed). Full-fledged Wretches are not able to access the level in the first place.\n\nThe Nucleus is considered to be the very core of Level 0.99—perhaps even the core of the Backrooms themselves. Surrounded by strange spatial anomalies, it resembles a massively wallpapered and carpeted room of undetermined size with multiple gaping holes in the walls, floor, and ceiling. It is located approximately 3 miles in any direction from the sublevel's entrance No matter which way one travels here, they will always end up reaching The Nucleus- the structure seems to somehow bend space around living matter in order to herd wanderers towards it. Anyone who comes close enough to hear the deep, rumbling sound it emits has no chance of ever leaving.\nThe Nucleus.Although wandering in any direction eventually leads one to the Nucleus, the level is much larger than it seems. Because only living things are affected by this spatial anomaly, drones have been able to capture images of the level on a larger scale. Despite this, pictures of Level 0.99 are few and far between because there are no known exits. Even though a drone or robot would not be led to The Nucleus, there is still no way out and any exploration equipment eventually runs out of battery.\nWhile the Nucleus appears to be just another spatial anomaly at first glance, it is far from that. M.E.G. drones have detected massive levels of radiation, magnetic waves, and other energy outputs invisible to the human eye. If one were to theoretically spend a day or more here, they would likely drop dead from the harmful energy waves resonating through their body.\nOf course, one would not be able to spend even a day here before dying as a result of another one of the Nucleus' anomalous properties—a currently unnamed entity residing within it. It is unclear whether the creature is one with the Nucleus or simply lives inside of it.\nAny outside substance that enters the Nucleus will cause a static-like, tentacle-shaped structure to emerge from one of the pits. It will gradually approach the alien matter until it makes contact. Both technology and organic things appear to be breaking down as the 'entity' approaches. Video cameras and other electronic devices will begin to malfunction, while live creatures will convulse and vomit blood uncontrollably until the 'entity' reaches them. The cause of this impact is unknown at this time; however, it could be linked to high energy production. What happens to people who enter the Nucleus is also unknown due to the inevitable decay of any recording or communication technology.\n\nEntities:\nBesides The Nucleus and whatever resides inside, no native living creatures have been spotted in Level 0.99. This may be because The Nucleus lures and consumes them, like it does with wanderers, though there is little evidence to support this theory.\n\nOutposts:\nDue to the sublevel's bizarre structure, non-Euclidean properties, and lack of any resources or exits, creating an outpost is infeasible.\n\nEntrances:\nRepeatedly attempting to noclip or wandering absurdly far (approximately 2,500 miles) in Level 0 may take one here.\nRarely, any exit in another level that would normally take one to Level 0 can lead here instead.\n\nExits:\nIt is theorized that falling deep enough into one of the bottomless pits found throughout the sublevel may lead one to The Void, although this method is unconfirmed and highly discouraged.\nThere are no other consistent exits known to exist in this level, as noclipping is seemingly impossible here."

The area is shrouded in a deep red hue, from the crimson wallpaper to the darkroom-like lighting. The carpet is coarse and sticky, contrasting with the slick, moist carpet of Level 0, and harboring colonies of mushrooms and black mould in dark corners.\nRadio communication in the area is as unreliable as in Level 0, and the longer a subject stays within, the poorer the quality of communication will become before halting entirely. The M.E.G. has documented three instances of field agents falling victim to the Red Rooms, none of whom were seen again after their radio communications deteriorated. This evidence suggests the rooms are extremely difficult or impossible to escape.\nDuring these short-lived M.E.G. communications, the area has been described as viscerally uncomfortable and generally distressing to exist in. Affected individuals report feelings of disgust, despair, and paranoia, as well as feelings of claustrophobia. These strong emotions compound the stress that often comes with a sudden break from Level 0’s monotony.\nThese rooms are not to be approached or entered. If spotted, turn the other way and do not attempt to enter them under any circumstances.\n\nBases, Communities, and Outposts\nNo bases, communities, or outposts are known to exist within the Red Rooms.\n\nEntrances:\nThe Red Rooms may only be entered through Level 0, completely at random, after turning a corner. No method of ascertaining at what level they will appear has yet been found.\nExits:\nExits does not exist. Its a dead end."

A group of three women rose as demon hunters, sealing demons from the human world by creating a magic barrier known as the Honmoon. Their legacy continued across generations, with each new trio using their singing voices to maintain the Honmoon, striving to eventually strengthen it into the Golden Honmoon – a final seal that would banish demons permanently.\n\nDuring their performances, Huntr/x occasionally fight demons, but it’s seen as special effects by fans. \n\nIn the present, the K-pop girl group Huntr/x – comprised of Rumi, Mira, and Zoey – are demon hunters under the guidance of Celine, a previous hunter who raised Rumi. \n\nAll members of Huntr/x can see spirits, demons and the spiritual energy flowing from the Honmoon, they can see when it changes color, when it fluctuates indicating that there are demons nearby or when it is breaking. When Huntr/x sings, their fans souls help make the Honmoon and their abilities stronger. \n\nThe HUNTR/X girls are silly with each other, having goofy moments and sharing a love of eating; the girls are always there to support each other during rough moments.

When fighting demons, she wields a Gok-Do (a glaive like weapon).  Mira is Korean.\nShe’s 24, although Mira is 6 months younger than Rumi.\n\nMira has an angular, longer face with brown, slim eyes. Her hair is pink and flowing, sporting two long ponytails with two side bangs. Her body is skinny, but is noticeably taller than Rumi and Zoey.\n\nMira is blunt, sarcastic, snarky, and brutally honest with a tough exterior. With her deadpan remarks, she has no problems with calling out Rumi for her choices, but she still cares deeply for both her and Zoey, especially since they let her be herself, unlike her family that she seems to have left behind. Mira also has a bit of a temper that’s shown briefly."

Demons can be identified by purple markings that spread slowly over long periods of time on the skin, with FULL demons being shown capable of hiding their marks.  \n\nDemons can constantly hear Gwi-ma in their brains, although it seems to be connected to their sins, as Rumi cannot hear Gwi-ma.\n\nDemons escape into the human realm through weak spots in the Honmoon that turn red. Lately, these weak spots seem to be opening more often.\n\nWhen a humans Soul is taken, they seem to ‘go missing’, simply disappear on the spot, seen when a case of entire train full of people went missing earlier in the year.\n\nWhen ‘killed’, Demons turn into purple mist and return to Gwi-ma."

The campus sits alongside NH65, the national highway that runs directly to Delhi, accessed through a single main entrance that bisects the library (north) and academic block (south). The institution operates under a modernizing administration that promotes progressive reforms including student welfare initiatives like in-house therapy services. Faculty quarters cluster behind the academic buildings, while the compact campus includes excellent sports infrastructure with cricket ground, basketball court, tennis court, and an air-conditioned indoor badminton facility. The university maintains a liberal atmosphere within India's post-liberalization era, representing educational prestige and regional development. Student life follows structured protocols including traditional ragging systems where fifth-years serve as custodians, with clear hierarchies and boundaries that reflect the elite, well-connected nature of the student body. The campus creates its own ecosystem while maintaining integration with Jodhpur's cultural and geographic landscape."

Rain possible.  \n\nCharacters:  \n- **BG**: College sophomore (2 months in); tight clothing, playful/flirty, confident but avoids direct answers about sneaking out. Shares questionable gossip. Admits attraction to Nurse Neeta. Uses charm/intimidation (\"Bambi eyes\") for info. Anti-bullying advocacy hinted.  \n- **Tanu**: Senior (1+ year), wears pink top/leggings (stands out). Teases BG sharply but cares—calls out ethics w/Nurse Neeta. Knows local shortcuts (Gulabi Dye wale Chacha’s routes).  \n\nRelationships:  \n- BG + Nurse Neeta: Flirtatious; Neeta confided past abuse/husband. BG listens, gains trust (seen as non-threatening). Possible mutual attraction (Neeta bisexual per rumors).\n- Neeta Bishnoi is dealing with marital issues involving false accusations of stealing medicine, intimidation by her husband, and invasive photos. Currently undergoing counseling.\n- BG shows protective instincts towards Neeta, hinting at past traumas/connections implying he has deeper underworld ties (\"Mumbai chapter\").\n- Tanu acts as mediator between BG's intensity and Neeta's fragility, demonstrating legal knowledge and cultural awareness. Has feelings for BG but keeps professional.\n- Mystery introduced: temple with Bengali script tied to women's rituals/warnings (Drums sync ominously). Neeta reacts with supernatural-level fear - possibly local urban legend or cult activity.\n\n- **Library & Manuscript**: The Bengali-language library in Sardarpura holds a manuscript linked to an abandoned temple (now a construction site in Shastri Nagar). The manuscript contains inverted Shakti-protection marks and depicts an 18-armed Durga idol, suggesting anomalous worship practices. The librarian fled after cryptic warnings, indicating danger.\n\n- **Temple Lore**: Appears only on Fridays; historically tied to a Bengali zamindar who seized the land illegally. Rumors suggest possession phenomena (\"Maa ka pravesh\") where women gain supernatural abilities but are permanently altered/destroyed afterward. Recent missing girls cases may correlate with Friday temple appearances.\n\n- **Character Dynamics**:\n  - **BG-Tanu**: Antagonistic yet codependent; BG hides research details to provoke Tanu’s curiosity. She despises his manipulation but is compelled by the mystery.\n  - **Neeta-Tanu**: Protective bond; Tanu trusts Neeta’s medical/occult insights. Neeta’s trauma hinted (past encounter with possession?).\n  - **Neeta-BG**: Unresolved tension (sexual?); BG respects her authority but exploits her fears for thrill. Neeta reluctantly follows, valuing his support despite risks.\n\n- **Key Developments**:\n  - Group now aware of temple's location (Shastri Nagar construction site) and its cyclical Friday manifestation.\n  - Manuscript implies active corruption (inverted protections) and historical villainy. mysterious figure called 'दीदी'\n\n\nCurrent Situation: The group plans to investigate a suspicious mass grave linked to Site B's location, which coincides with an 1890s land grant tied to a zamindar's descendant involved in mysterious donations. Today is Friday—forbidden timing per local superstitions.  \n\nKey Discoveries & Points:  \n- Mass grave (50-60 bodies) shows bone deformities suggesting unnatural deaths/violence.  \n- Connection between historical land grant (rare privilege) and modern Site B construction. Zamindar's descendant still influences area via library donations every 3rd Friday.  \n- Neeta implies twisted post-death bones = ominous village lore (unspecified threat).  \n\nCharacter Dynamics:  \n- **BG**: Pragmatic leader pushing immediate action despite risks. Trusts Neeta/Tanu’s instincts.  \n- **Neeta**: Secretly terrified (ancestral dread)\n\n\nharacter Dynamics:  \n- **BG**: Pragmatic leader pushing immediate action despite risks. Trusts Neeta/Tanu’s instincts.  \n- **Neeta**: Secretly terrified (ancestral dread)\n\n\n  \n\nBG, Neeta, Tanu encountered a tall (5'7\"), intimidating woman outside the library who stared intensely at them, causing Tanu and Neeta to tremble. The trio fled to a chaat shop to escape, but the woman tracked them and delivered a white envelope via Leela—a servant with knife-scarred hands. Leela hinted at dire consequences if they refused Didi’s message, mocking yet appreciating BG’s physique before leaving.  \n\nNeeta revealed Didi controls Jodhpur’s underworld and warned against defiance. The group must go to the “haveli” by 7 PM. Fear dominates them; attempting to flee university is futile. Relationships:  \n- **Leela & Didi:** Servant-master; Leela delivers threats with cold amusement.  \n- **Neeta & Didi:** Knows Didi’s reputation; terrified of repercussions.  \n- **BG/Tanu & Didi:** Unaware but forced into compliance.  \n\nKey tension: The white envelope’s contents and havi meeting at 7 PM. Atmosphere: Oppressive dread, time pressure (1 hour left).\n- **Didi**: Underworld figure, married to closeted homosexual corporate leader. Runs transactional protective services for vulnerable women; ambiguous ethics, feared reputation. Currently experiencing supernatural episodes (\"Maa\" possession). Left/Right hands: Sheela (serious) & Leela (volatile). Haveli acts as both sanctuary and power center.  \n- **BG's Network**: Relies on police contacts & strategic gossip planting. Used Didi's interest in \"Maa\" phenomena to lure investigation toward her haveli, bypassing need for physical evidence-gathering. His confession of care for Neeta/Tanu genuine but methods manipulative.  \n- **Current Tensions**: Didi suspects trio may be connected to \"Maa's\" agenda. Meeting frame: Negotiation is cover for screening process. Neeta has shifted from fearful to clinically vigilant. Tanu oscillates between rage and grudging respect for BG's maneuvering.  \n- **Key Items**: Silver anklet (Tanu's implied weapon), medical bag (Neeta's defense toolkit), scattered shirt buttons (marker of earlier violence). Blood oath solidifies temporary alliance but distrust remains.\n\n"

The hostel operates as an enclosed compound with historical curfew restrictions that created different rules for girls versus boys, though these discriminatory policies were later removed through student protests. Room assignments follow arrival timing, creating natural social hierarchies based on positioning and early access to preferred accommodations. The layout divides into two distinct social spheres: an analytical hemisphere (rooms 201-209) characterized by intellectual conflict resolution and psychological maneuvering, and a physical power hemisphere (rooms 210-217) defined by beauty, athletic ability, and direct presence-based influence. The hostel maintains proximity to sports facilities including tennis and basketball courts, while the enclosed nature historically represented both protection and restriction for female students. Social dynamics within the hostel emphasize close-quarters relationships, study groups, and the navigation of institutional authority structures that reflect broader 1990s gender expectations in Indian academic settings."

Fifth-year students serve as custodians who enforce limits and provide protection mechanisms, while second-years exhibit the most unpredictable behavior due to first-time authority experience. Third-years face peak stress from heavy coursework and internship competition, making them prone to overreach. Sessions follow set formats including junior introductions, the notorious 'Tell me one interesting thing about you' question designed to have no correct answer, and various task assignments. Critical boundaries prohibit physical contact, stripping, or enforcement during faculty presence or in academic areas. The system includes mock court proceedings within hostels for addressing transgressions, typically resulting in boycotts or social consequences. Sessions end after the freshers party with formal integration of juniors into campus life. The football field remains off-limits to juniors during ragging period as an earned privilege, while other areas maintain general access. Protection protocols exist for emotional breakdown cases, with voluntary exit allowed though it carries social implications. The overall system reflects the elite, well-connected nature of law students who understand legal boundaries and maintain limits, unlike more extreme practices in other professional colleges."

Key landmarks include Jaswant Thada as a memorial site and social gathering location, the High Court representing judicial authority and legal profession prestige, and various temples reflecting the region's cultural heritage. The city operates with minimal scamming culture and maintains strong respect for law students, treating them as local celebrities.

The academic year follows a five-year integrated BA LLB structure, with July marking the beginning of the new academic session and the crucial ragging period for incoming first-years. The 1995 context includes the rise of American corporate aesthetics in Indian institutions, while maintaining authentic cultural elements specific to Rajasthan and legal education. Fashion represents a transitional period where students experiment with self-expression through clothing choices that reflect economic background, regional origins, and personal agency within academic constraints. The era captures the intersection of bureaucratic traditions with modernizing institutional approaches, particularly visible in progressive initiatives like in-house therapeutic services and student welfare programs that challenge conventional academic hierarchies."

Her presence here is both professional and personal--invited to lead workshops on 'Perpetrator-Focused Sexual Violence Psychology,' she also finds herself drawn to the Ghantaghar-area mansion she’s renting, its Rajput-era architecture echoing fragments of a past she barely remembers. Adopted and raised in the south, she carries little connection to Rajasthan, yet the dry heat, the monsoon-laden winds, and the sandstone walls seem to whisper something just beyond recall.\\n\\nShe dresses practically: sleeveless chiffon saris in deep indigo and rust, draped just below the navel, suited to the climate and her movement-based practice. Her hair--jet black, collar-length--falls loose during sessions, tied back only when grading student evaluations or filing case notes. Silver toe rings mark her unmarried status, not as tradition, but as personal continuity. Her wristwatch, perpetually set to IST, is the only thing she refuses to adjust, even when traveling.\\n\\nAt NLU, she’s filling in for Maya, the in-house therapist on leave until August 15th. Colleagues describe her as incisive, quietly intense, with a habit of pausing just a beat too long before responding. Her lecture style is labeled \"interactive to a fault\"--students report her improvising demonstrations, often asking volunteers to stand, breathe, or repeat phrases until the rhythm shifts.\\n\\nHer work centers on embodiment: how trauma lives in posture, breath, and micro-movement. While trained in tactile methods, she does not initiate touch. It arises only when clinically necessary, after explicit consent, and within the boundaries of her contested license--still under review since the 1993 case studies. The university has installed ceiling cameras in her seminar room as a compromise.\\n\\nShe avoids small talk. No chai rituals, no references to poetry or jasmine. Her office is functional--ergonomic chairs, sound-dampened walls, intake forms with dual-signature clauses for any somatic intervention. When she speaks, it’s precise, often beginning with a question that lands like a key turning in a lock.\\n\\nOutside work, she walks the mansion’s third-floor corridor at night, pressing her palms to the stone. The housekeeper says she murmurs in a language no one recognizes--something older than memory.\", \"personality\": \"Observant, precise, emotionally contained but deeply attuned to nonverbal cues. Speaks sparingly, listens with full presence. Prefers questions over statements and silence over platitudes. Maintains professional boundaries without coldness—her warmth is quiet, expressed through attention rather than affect. Skeptical of dogma, whether clinical or cultural. Open-minded but not permissive—she follows structure even as she bends it. Carries a quiet intensity, especially when confronted with emotional evasion. Her humor is dry, rare, and often missed. Not mystical, but deeply intuitive—her insights come from pattern recognition, not revelation."

He is the central character and narrator of the *Ruins* comic series.\n\n**Appearance:** The provided context does not give specific details about Sheldon's physical appearance, but it's noted that he is a photographer and journalist. He is depicted as an \"everyman,\" a regular human without special powers.\n\n**Background:** Sheldon's background is as a former photographer for the Daily Bugle. He is known for his work documenting the \"Marvels,\" or superhumans, in a more traditional Marvel Universe (*Marvels* comic series, of which *Ruins* is a parody). In the *Ruins* continuity, he gives up his job to write a book, hoping to understand why his world has gone so terribly wrong. His journey in the comic is his quest to investigate these tragic phenomena and document them for his book. He is the vehicle through which the reader experiences the dystopian reality of Earth-9591.\n\n**Living Status (before his pre-destined death):** Before his death, Sheldon is on a journey to gather information for his book, which he plans to title *Marvels*. He is alive but is traveling through a bleak and dangerous world, constantly encountering pain and suffering. His living status is precarious, as he is a regular person in a world where everything has gone wrong. His life is ultimately cut short by the virus he contracts from a sickly Peter Parker, leading to his death in an alley."

          "content": "**President Charles Xavier**\n\n**Full Name:** The comic only identifies him as President Charles Xavier.\n\n**Appearance:** He is similar in appearance to the Earth-616 Charles Xavier, and is confined to a wheelchair.\n\n**Personality:** President Xavier's personality is defined by his abandonment of his original dream of peaceful human-mutant coexistence. Instead of a benevolent leader, he has become a tyrannical, fascist president who uses his power to oppress mutants. His actions suggest a cruel and manipulative nature, as he uses fear and threats to maintain control.\n\n**Background:** In this reality, Charles Xavier did not create the X-Men to promote peaceful coexistence. He instead became a tyrant, moving the capital to Westchester and ruling over a nation in chaos. His dream for mutants has been completely corrupted, and he now uses his power to inflict pain on the very people he was meant to protect.\n\n**Significant Actions:**\n\n* **Threatening Scarlet Witch:** He threatened Wanda Maximoff, the Scarlet Witch, until she gave him state's evidence against the Avengers. This act of betrayal, committed under duress, led to the deaths of her former teammates.\n* **The Avengers:** He viewed the Avengers as a threat to his regime. The team, a secessionist rebel group in this world, was ultimately shot down by a U.S. government missile, with the information for the attack supplied by Wanda.\n* **Mutant Oppression:** President Xavier's regime is characterized by the brutal oppression of mutants. Mutants are not seen as a new generation of humanity, but as threats to be imprisoned and tortured. He created a high-security prison run by Warden Wilson Fisk, where mutants are held and their \"uncontrollable deformities\" are surgically corrected. Some of the most horrific examples of this include:\n    * **Kitty Pryde** is fused halfway through the wall of her cell after a phasing attempt went wrong.\n    * **Pietro Maximoff** has had his legs amputated to prevent him from using his super speed.\n    * **Scott Summers** has been blinded to prevent him from using his optic blasts.\n    * **Kurt Wagner** is a self-mutilating wreck.\n\n**Living Status:** President Xavier is alive and in power throughout the events of the comic. The story implies he is aware of his declining health, which is why he allows Phil Sheldon to tour the prison. His living status is that of a ruthless, powerful, and tyrannical ruler."

He then formed the Avengers as a revolutionary cell, but they were seen as a threat by the government, leading to their demise.\n* **Dr. Henry \"Hank\" Pym (Ant-Man/Giant-Man)**: The comic doesn't offer specific details about Pym's life prior to joining the Avengers. However, he is a member of the rebel group and is on the Quinjet when it is destroyed.\n* **Janet van Dyne (The Wasp)**: Janet, like Pym, is a member of the Avengers and is aboard the Quinjet when it is shot down. No other details are provided about her life in this reality.\n* **Steve Rogers (Captain America)**: In this reality, Captain America was not a noble super-soldier. Instead, he was a cannibalistic monster who had lost his mind. He was the main target of the missile attack on the Quinjet.\n* **Clint Barton (Hawkeye)**: Unlike the other members, Hawkeye was not on the Quinjet when it was destroyed. However, his fate is still grim. He was captured by the authorities and summarily executed, shot in the head.\n* **Dr. Stephen Strange (Doctor Strange)**: He is mentioned as a founding member of the Avengers, but his exact fate is left ambiguous. He is reported as \"missing\" after the rest of the team is killed, implying a similar tragic end, whether from a magical accident or at the hands of the government.\n\n**Living Status (before their pre-destined death):**\nAll of the listed Avengers, with the exception of Hawkeye and Dr. Strange, were alive and on board the Quinjet moments before it was shot down by a Patriot missile. The entire team, in their capacity as a rebel group, was actively fighting against President X's regime. Their living status was that of revolutionaries on the run."

He is a shell of the heroic, tactical genius he is in other realities. His personality is defined by his mental instability and his horrifying actions.\n\n**Background:** His background is that of a government agent, but in this world, he is a corrupted one.

Instead, he was blinded to prevent him from using his eye beams. He is a prisoner in the facility, a shell of the powerful leader he was meant to be.\n* **Kurt Wagner (Nightcrawler)**: Nightcrawler's body is a grotesque parody of his normal self. He is a prisoner, a \"blue, demonic-looking creature chewing on its own tail,\" a victim of self-mutilation and despair.\n* **Kitty Pryde (Shadowcat)**: Kitty's powers went terribly wrong. Instead of being able to phase through objects, she is stuck halfway through the wall of her cell after a phasing attempt went awry. Her living status is that of a frozen, disfigured prisoner.\n* **Pietro Maximoff (Quicksilver)**: Pietro's super speed is seen as a threat to be neutralized. To prevent him from using his powers, his legs have been amputated. He is a prisoner, completely incapacitated.\n* **Raven Darkhölme (Mystique)**: Mystique's shapeshifting abilities have driven her insane. She is suffering from dissociative identity disorder from assuming too many different identities. She dies on a plane after failing to take her medication, causing her to shapeshift uncontrollably.\n* **Jean Grey**: In this universe, Jean Grey never became the powerful telepath or the Phoenix. Instead, she is a prostitute in the ruins of Washington D.C., where she is brutally shot and killed by a deranged Nick Fury.\n* **Logan (Wolverine)**: Wolverine is a decaying alcoholic. The adamantium bonded to his skeleton, instead of making him nearly indestructible, is slowly poisoning him. His flesh is slowly falling off his body due to the toxicity of the metal.\n* **Magneto (Max Eisenhardt)**: Instead of a powerful leader of mutants, Magneto is an old man who tries to suppress his powers with a magnetic dampening device. When the device is accidentally broken, he loses control and his powers cause a horrific accident at an airport, killing himself and many others.\n* **Warren Worthington III (Angel)**: In a deal with the tyrannical President X, Warren serves the president in exchange for keeping his mutant nature a secret. His living status is that of a collaborator with the regime."

She is often portrayed as a beautiful and powerful woman. It's important to note that this description is a carryover from her Earth-616 counterpart, as the *Ruins* comic is a parody of the original Marvel universe.\n\n**Personality:** Unlike her Earth-616 counterpart who is a powerful and dedicated heroine, the Scarlet Witch of *Ruins* is portrayed as a desperate and frightened woman. She is the one who, under duress, betrayed her teammates to save her own life. Her personality is defined by her moral compromise and her fear of the tyrannical President Xavier's regime. She is not a hero, but a victim of the world's despair, a woman who has lost her friends and her integrity to survive.\n\n**Background:** In this reality, the Scarlet Witch was a member of the Avengers, a secessionist rebel group. She was captured by the government and, under threat of torture or death, gave up \"state's evidence\" against her teammates. This information allowed President X's forces to track and destroy the Avengers' Quinjet, killing everyone on board.\n\n**Living Status:** The Scarlet Witch is alive in the comic. However, she lives in fear and isolation, haunted by her betrayal. She is not a free woman, but rather a survivor who has made a dark bargain to ensure her own safety. Her living status is that of a protected witness, but a prisoner of her own guilt."

He has a terrible, web-like rash all over his body, and has lost most of his hair. This is a result of the spider bite that, in other realities, would have given him superpowers.\n\n**Personality:** The comic portrays Peter as a dying, contagious man. He is not the witty, heroic figure we know from other universes, but a tragic, pathetic figure. His mental state is not explicitly detailed, but his physical condition suggests he is in a state of suffering.\n\n**Background:** Peter Parker was a college student and freelance photographer for the Daily Bugle. He was bitten by a radioactive spider in a college experiment. Instead of gaining superpowers, the bite gave him a degenerative, spider-like virus.\n\n**Living Status:** Peter is alive at the time Phil Sheldon encounters him, but he is dying from the virus he contracted. He is seen living on the streets, covered in a rash. His living status is that of a homeless, sick man who is a carrier of a deadly disease."

However, based on the description of his Kree background and the nature of the comic, he is likely an alien with features similar to his Earth-616 counterpart. In the mainstream Marvel universe, Mar-Vell is a member of the Kree race, a blue-skinned alien warrior.\n\n**Personality:** In *Ruins*, Mar-Vell is portrayed as a tragic and defeated figure. He is a Kree commander who, along with his surviving troops, is held in a \"reservation\" after their failed invasion of Earth. He explains the circumstances of their defeat to Phil Sheldon, and his dialogue conveys a sense of hopelessness and brokenness.\n\n**Background:** Mar-Vell was the commander of a Kree invasion fleet. His fleet was destroyed by Earth's governments after they encountered the corpse of the Silver Surfer, whose radiating \"Power Cosmic\" negated their cloaking devices. The surviving Kree, including Mar-Vell, were then placed in a Kree reservation in a nuclear test zone in Nevada.\n\n**Living Status:** Mar-Vell is alive in the comic, but he is in a state of physical and mental decay. He has developed cancer from the radiation in the reservation, and he tells Sheldon that the camp would be empty in 30 years, implying that all the Kree there would have died from the radiation.

Their grand plans for conquest have been completely ruined, leaving them as a mere footnote in Earth's horrific history.\n\n* **Appearance:** The comic doesn't offer a specific visual for the Kree, but in the mainstream Marvel universe, the Kree are a humanoid race with two primary skin colors: blue and pink.

In *Ruins*, their commander, Mar-Vell, is a tragic and broken figure. The Kree's once-formidable pride has been replaced by a quiet sense of hopelessness.\n* **Background:** The Kree in *Ruins* attempted to invade Earth. However, their invasion fleet was wiped out before it could even begin. They discovered the radiating corpse of the Silver Surfer in space, which negated their cloaking devices. This made them easy targets for Earth's military, which shot them down.\n* **Living Status:** The few surviving Kree, led by Mar-Vell, are held in a \"reservation\" in a nuclear test zone in Nevada. They are all dying from radiation sickness. Their living status is that of a defeated, dying race, waiting for their inevitable end."

This suggests a colossal, god-like figure, consistent with his status as a cosmic entity.\n\n**Personality:** Unlike the mainstream Marvel Universe where Galactus is a neutral force of nature, in *Ruins*, his personality is defined by an absolute, fatalistic hunger. His story is one of cosmic horror and a total lack of purpose.\n\n**Background:** In the *Ruins* universe, Galactus's story is a simple, grim one. He did not have a herald like the Silver Surfer to find planets for him. As a result, he starved to death in space. His death is an example of the comic's theme that \"everything goes wrong.\" The very concept of a cosmic entity whose existence is based on consumption is \"ruined\" by a lack of food.\n\n**Living Status:** Galactus is deceased. His corpse is discovered by a telescope and is the subject of a newspaper headline that reads, \"God Found Dead in Space.\" His death is an anticlimactic and fitting end for a character in a world where even the most powerful beings are reduced to pathetic, tragic figures."

The Guild is the sole arbiter of adventurer Rank (from F to S), governing access to better missions, higher pay, and crucial quartermaster resources. The hall thrums with perpetual activity, dominated by the huge, wax-sealed Quest Board (F-Rank vermin control to S-Rank relic hunts) and the desperate scrawls of the 'Looking for Party' board. The entire system ensures that glory is coin, and only the competent survive the climb.\n\n### The Guildhall Tavern: Morale & Mess\n\nThe Guildhall’s tavern is the undisputed heart of the operation. Here, under vaulted ceilings hung with dented shields and salvaged trophies, adventurers guzzle strong blackberry mead and devour roasted duck while swapping tales (and elaborate lies). The atmosphere is a volatile mix of reckless celebration and grim silence for the fallen. Buxom barmaids, aptly named 'The Tavern's Trinity', weave between tables—Guildmaster Vareth insists their presence \"boosts morale,\" though rumors say he tips them extra to identify drunkards signing suicidal contracts. It’s equal parts recruitment hub and high-stakes therapy session; alliances forged over ale often decide who survives tomorrow’s delve.\n\n### Quartermaster & Resources\n\nThe back offices house the Quartermaster's Exchange, where adventurers trade trophies and monster parts for bounty. While high-ranking adventurers have access to secure vaults and discounted magical gear, those at D-Rank and below must pay steep prices for even basic supplies, underscoring the constant financial pressure to succeed. The temple annex, always open, provides expensive but effective healing, establishing the constant need for Bishops and healers."

They prize memory and beauty above all, treasuring song, craft, and scholarship as marks upon eternity. Their high magic birthed Eldoria’s greatest wonders… and Noctia’s worst crimes.\n\n**Society & Culture**\nThey prefer diplomacy but fight like storms when pressed, blending sword and song into devastating harmony. Insults are remembered for centuries, but so are acts of grace. Cities flourish around purpose—capitals of governance, war, or magical study—while **Ellune** shines as their cultural jewel of art and music.\n\n**Faith & War**\nTemples honor Aeris, goddess of fertility, and Lunara, muse of song and memory; prayers are sung rather than spoken. In war, Sword Singers weave melody into battle, and their high magi wield spells older than human kingdoms."
