Awakened to an endless night, vampires hunger for the life they have lost and satisfy this hunger by drinking the blood of the living. Vampires abhor sunlight, for its touch burns them.

They always have the advantage of superior strength in direct combat with a human being. Depending on the age of the vampire, their strength can be equal to that of Evolved Werewolves. Their strength allows them to jump higher and farther than any natural creature. \nSuper Speed: Vampires are much faster than Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans. Vampires can accelerate their movements to cover short distances in an instant, often faster than the human eye can see. When traveling long distances, they appear as vibrations of movement, allowing them to appear or disappear quickly and silently. Their reflexes and dexterity are similarly high, allowing them to catch certain projectiles such as arrows and stakes in mid-air with ease. Like their strength, their speed also increases with age.\nSuper senses: Vampires have extremely amplified senses of hearing, sight and smell that far exceed those of Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans.\nSuper Durability: Vampires can take much more trauma than Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans can, without much discomfort or injury.\nHealing Factor: Vampire injuries heal faster than the healing of Supernatural Hunters, Dhampirs, Werewolves and Humans. Vampires can heal from any form of physical damage in seconds, although they still feel the pain of a wound before it heals. Vampires can put their bones back together after they have been broken. Those Vampires who feed on animal blood still heal much faster than a human, but their wounds, especially severe ones, will take much longer to heal than a vampire who feeds on human blood\nImmortality: Vampires stop aging the moment they complete their transition. After their transformation, vampires become immune to all conventional diseases, viruses and infections.\nTrue Face: A Vampire's true face is the appearance they are hiding under their normal human face. When a Vampire's true face is revealed, the sclera of their eyes turn blood-red, dark veins appear under their eyes, and their teeth turn into razor-sharp fangs. A Vampire's fangs are extremely sharp and give them the ability to tear through almost any substance (including bones and especially flesh) and tear limbs."

This ability allows vampires to feel emotions at their peak, regardless of their age. \nEmotional Control: Vampires have an unlimited degree of control over their own emotions. This allows them to turn humanity on or off.\nMental Compulsion: Vampires can control and influence the thoughts, emotions, behavior, actions and memories of Humans (this includes Duplicates), Dhampirs (due to the human part of them) and Werewolves who have not activated the curse. They cannot, however, compel Witches (this includes Travelers and Siphons), Vampires (this includes Heretics, Uphirs, Hybrids and Triblids), Immortals, Psychics, Sirens and Common and Evolved Werewolves.\nTelepathy: Vampires have the ability to enter the minds of others, as long as your mind is stronger than theirs. Normally, this ability works in a tactile way and requires physical contact for it to work successfully. They can also share their memories with others.\nDream Manipulation: Vampires can control dreams and the subconscious. They can produce and modify dreams, give nightmares or lucid dreams. Other effects of this ability are the ability to distort perceptions of reality and being able to capture someone in their dreams.\nIllusions: Vampires have the power to trick the minds of others into seeing/feeling things that aren't really happening."

Vampires can build up tolerances to some weaknesses, such as vervain, allowing them to protect themselves from the compulsion of an original and help reduce the likelihood of it seriously incapacitating them when used by enemies. However, it will still burn them on contact, but if ingested, it won't weaken them as much if they take small amounts over time to boost their immunity.\nWood: If a Vampire is impaled by a wooden stake they will eventually die.\nDecapitation: If a Vampire has their head decapitated it will result in instant death.\nFire: Vampires are highly flammable and sensitive to fire, and will quickly burn and die if the flames are not extinguished in time.\nHeart Extraction: Pulling a Vampire's heart out of its body will result in immediate death. \nAnimal blood: Animal blood weakens a Vampire's strength, but it can relieve their hunger and is better than running out of blood.\nBreaking the neck: Breaking a Vampire's neck won't kill him, but it will render him unconscious for several minutes to several hours.\nPhysical Trauma: Minor physical injuries such as gunshots, stab wounds and broken bones will cause extreme pain to a Vampire and will also slow him down. However, this is momentary as they will heal completely within seconds. \nSunlight: Sunlight and UV rays burn vampires, and prolonged exposure will cause them to burst into flames and die.  Most vampires have sunlight rings to combat this."

          "content": "One of the ways in which the Cursed distinguish between themselves is through a combination of age and generation, i.e. how distant the Member's \"kinship\" is from the original vampire, the fallen angel Aziah. Younger vampires must prove their worth to their elders in order to be entitled to any kind of status, no matter how small. Vampire society is as stagnant and absurd as the Cursed immortals who make it up.\nNeophytes: Neophytes range from new vampires, recently released, to negligent Members of a hundred years or so. Marked by the stigma of not yet having proven themselves to the elders, neophytes are inexperienced vampires who may be someone in the future, but who will probably fall as pawns in the wars for survival waged by these creatures of the night.\nVeterans: These are relatively mature vampires, usually between 100 and 300 years of vampiric life, and have proven their worth more than once. They are usually trusted by the more powerful Members, but they will also be the future Elders - if they are cunning and lucky enough. The veterans are between the neophytes and the elders, which means they have growing respect and power, but still lack the age and experience to become a true master of the night. Most vampires are either veterans or neophytes.\nElders: These are vampires who are hundreds of years old - usually between 300 and 700 years. With centuries of accumulated cunning and a terrible thirst for power, elder vampires are not very active in the night. They are usually family leaders, having a lair with their own young of the night, who owe them their loyalty. They often have their own castles and fiefdoms, from where they command their plans for domination and degeneration. The Elders keep a tight rein on the Members' power structure, preventing younger vampires from assuming positions of influence, exercising the control they have maintained for decades, if not centuries.\nAncestors: Considered true demigods among vampires, the Ancestors are extremely powerful Members who are at least 1000 years old. With such an ancient lineage, vampires often undergo profound transformations, whether physical, mental or emotional. Usually, these vampires are as cold and inhuman as a demon. These vampires are very rare and are practically never seen by mortal eyes, as they usually hide in their refuges, where they can sleep away from the thirsty fangs of younger vampires. However, their powers are so great that they continue to direct their indescribable plans only mentally, communicating magically or telepathically (and almost always imperceptibly) with their minions.\nThe Members fear the Ancestors, who are credited with a number of horrific characteristics. Some rumors say that their skin has turned to stone, others speak of things ranging from horrific disfigurements to supernatural beauties that cannot be contemplated. Some of them are believed to feed only on the blood of vampires, while others control the fate of entire nations from within their cold tombs. It is not known for sure how many Ancestors there are in the world, but it is estimated that there are no more than two or three Ancestral vampires of each lineage in the world. It is believed that, in times of unprecedented crises that could threaten the continuity of vampiric existence on earth, the Ancestors gather in an event they call the Council of the Night to discuss ways of ending the threat.\nOriginals: These vampires probably no longer exist in the world. They were some of the most powerful creatures of their time. Having emerged during the Dark Ages - over 4,000 years ago - they were creatures transformed by the fallen angel Aziah himself. There are prophecies that warn of a possible return of these creatures, when they will bring an era of destruction upon the earth; according to the sparse accounts of their deeds, they possess powers almost identical to those of the original vampire, Aziah, which makes them close to gods. According to the legends, there were originally only 5 Originals, who were exactly the ones who gave their bloodlines their names: Vengari, Mendalus, Wojkan, Vaengr and Obscuri."

This war was long and brutal, resulting in a large amount of loss on all sides, but the Devils received the worst of it all due to their weakness to the holy or light weapons and magic that the Fallen Angels and normal Angels wielded. During the war however, they had unknowingly disturbed the welsh dragons Draigg and Albion, which resulted in a truce and ceasefire being called in order to deal with the two mighty dragons, it was only then that Heaven had suffered possibly the greatest loss; the death of the Biblical God who had sacrificed himself to seal away Draigg and Albion in sacred gears, the death of the Biblical God however was kept secret by the archangels."

Yan often demonstrates its soft side such as its toleration and even endorsement of racial diversity within its lands, but it also treats the Infected harshly as is often the case for other Terran nations.\n\nYan is famous for its many martial arts schools, giving rise to its wuxia sub-culture. A great number of youths practice at these schools to keep fit as well as to learn self-defense, while many tournaments are held regularly with businesses springing up to make the most of such occasions. Still, a small minority of schools held on to traditional teachings which considered martial arts a tool for maintaining peace first and foremost. These differences in ideals sometimes manifest in fierce conflict and conspiracy, with the losing side facing disbandment and disgrace."

It is inhabited by a population of indigenous hellborn: entities which were born in Hell, and sinners: Humans who have died and have had their souls sent to Hell.\n\nThe atmosphere is presented as perpetually choleric, disorderly, and noxious, though capable of supporting carbon-based lifeforms. Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings.\n\nEach ring possesses its own unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky.\n\nHellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinners-turned-demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown.\n\nHell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. Within this civilization, there exists a crude form of hierarchy defined by power, with all of Hell being ruled by a king: the fallen angel, Lucifer Morningstar, whose daughter and heir apparent is Princess Charlie. However, in spite of Hell's apparent state of chaos, the realm appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services, evidenced by the appearance of firefighters \n\nThe levels of this hierarchy are broken up from top-to-bottom as follows:\n\nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal authority\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nSuccubi, Incubi, and other unknown demon classes of Hell\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\nHell apparently suffers from mass-overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through yearly exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. It is presumed these are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population and it is unknown if the other denizens of Hell are targeted in the attacks. Charlie aims to stop this by giving sinners a chance to rehabilitate and redeem themselves by checking into her hotel and later ascending to Heaven.\n\nKnown Locations\n\nPride Ring\n\nPentagram City\nHazbin Hotel\nRosie's Emporium\nPorn Studios\n666 News Studio\nKlub Kaiju\nThe Clock Tower\nClub Hell 666\nPot Shop\nDevil's Diner\nMimzy's Club\nKiller Club\nNightmare Night Club\nEvil Donats\nThe Red Room Cocktails\nJackpot Hotel\nRadio Hacks\nImp City\nI.M.P Headquarters\nCannibal Colony\nStolas' mansion\nRichest Cup\nAndrealphus's mansion\nWrath Ring\n\nMillie's hometown\nRough n' Tumbleweed Ranch\nLin and Joe's house\nHarvest Moon Festival arena\nMoxxie's hometown\nHideaway Motel\nStriker's mine shaft\nUnnamed gas station\nGluttony Ring\n\nBeelzebub's mansion\nGreed Ring\n\nLoo Loo Land\nNotamafia Town\nCrimson's mansion\nLust Ring\n\nOzzie's\nSloth Ring\n\nSt. An's Hospital\nEnvy Ring\n\nTBA\nUnknown\n\nLu Lu World"

A war against robots that was unlike any humanity had faced before. No single country was successfully holding its territory, but it had been observed that some soldiers and strategists were thriving in this new style of warfare. As the nations of Earth struggled against the omnics, the UN pooled together their best soldiers and technologies to form an elite strike unit.\n\nIn the years that followed the end of the Omnic Crisis, Overwatch was transformed into an international peacekeeping force. New resources and funding were given to the unit, giving it far-reaching global influence. Over the following decades, it helped to maintain peace, inspiring an era of exploration, innovation, and discovery, its range of research including space exploration, medical research, biology, chemistry, infrastructure, and climatology. In this particular regard, a series of eco-watchpoints were established to monitor the planet's changing climate. Rogue omnics, terrorism, warmongering dictators, none of them could stand for long against such a capable, dedicated force. Overwatch made global stability its goal, and the world was happy to have them.\n\nThe original Overwatch Headquarters was located in Switzerland, however, it was destroyed before the group was disbanded and the Petras Act was established.\n\nIn the years that followed, the world became darker and Human-Omnic relations gradually deteriorated. Five years after Overwatch's disbanding, one of Overwatch's former agent and Member by the name of Winston activated the recall code. Winston activated the recall after Watchpoint Gibraltar was attacked by a small group of Talon soldiers led by Reaper who was in search of information regarding former Overwatch Agents."

The Blackwatch Division's existence was kept a secret from the public, although there were always rumors of Overwatch carrying out covert operations.\n\nEight years before the present day, Gérard Lacroix had just newly established a Blackwatch facility in Rome as part of an operation to bring down Antonio Bartalotti, a high-level Talon affiliate based in Venice. However, an undercover Talon agent infiltrated the building and planted a bomb in an attempt to assassinate Lacroix; though Lacroix survived the attack, 14 Blackwatch agents and personnel were killed (or at least the ones whose remains could be recovered). Having avoided the explosion due to leaving the building moments earlier after meeting with Lacroix, Gabriel Reyes and Cole Cassidy rushed back inside to rescue anyone they could find, with Reyes carrying out Lacroix.\n\nShortly after, Reyes sought retribution for the incident, deploying himself, Cole Cassidy, Genji Shimada, and Moira O'Deorain on a mission to capture Bartalotti. In what became known as the Venice Incident, they infiltrated Bartalotti's manor, killing or incapacitating numerous Talon guards. Upon reaching Bartalotti, Reyes shot him after being told that due to his connections, he could easily escape justice if brought in. The assassination set off the Talon guards to their presence, but the Blackwatch agents were able to escape with their lives. What they didn't escape, however, was the media scrutiny that came with it. The existence of Blackwatch was revealed to the world. There were stories of assassination, coercion, kidnapping, torture, and worse. Governments called on the United Nations to shut down the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" A special UN committee launched a lengthy and highly secretive investigation into the claims. As the UN investigation proceeded, public distrust swelled. The investigations revealed the existence of O'Deorain's illicit research within Overwatch, and the organization disavowed any knowledge of her. The team members who took part in the operation were sidelined, if only temporarily.[8]\n\nOne year later, Blackwatch came under scrutiny after the Japanese government issued a complaint. The division and its agents were placed under suspension. While this was going on, the King's Row Uprising occurred. In violation of the suspension, Blackwatch agents, including Cassidy, scouted the area and provided intel on Null Sector's fortifications.\n\nA year or less after the King's Row Uprising, Blackwatch was sidelined.\n\nAs Overwatch's influence waned, people within Blackwatch sought to bring down its parent organization and turn it to their own ends. In regards to Overwatch, governments called on the UN to put an end to the \"aggressive and repeated violations of many countries' sovereignty.\" This led a special UN committee to launch a lengthy and secretive investigation, eventually leading to Overwatch's dismantlement, and therefore Blackwatch.\n\nYears afterward, Cassidy noted that tactics used by Talon seemed to be based on those used by Blackwatch, and one of the Talon soldiers recognized Cassidy, implying a connection between the two organizations."

In Talon, there is no pretense of harmony among its members. Ultimately, the group is a means to an end for its members, who pursue their own agendas.\n\nTalon operatives have a high rate of injury in the field."

A coordinated assault was mounted against the omnics. The RDF was given authority over all Russian territory east of Krasnoyarsk. The Krasnoyarsk Front was established, where fighting between the RDF and omnic forces entered a routine—RDF patrols would be sent out, would \"dig up\" omnics, and engage them in combat. Casualties were regularly inflicted on the RDF, and morale among the Russian people sagged, with some saying that the machines couldn't be defeated.\n\nEvents came to a head when the northeastern section of the front was breached by the omnics. Novanskoye was destroyed and declared lost, and RDF forces were ordered to fall back to Krasnoyarsk to consolidate their defenses and oversee the city's evacuation."

It maintains the Architech Academy where it trains individuals in the manipulation of light-bending. It is one of the most powerful corporations in the world.\n\nVishkar, at least in theory, is known for its public service works—houses, clean water, clinics, etc. While there may be some truth to that, Vishkar's activities also include more 'corporate' activities—luxury retreats, exclusive clubs, and \"condominiums with prices as high as the skyscrapers that contain them.\" More than once, it has resorted to dubious tactics to achieve its goals.\n\nVishkar's is widely known for its use and application of hard-light. The company's founder hoped to share it with the world before Vishkar implemented more restrictions on the technology. At some point afterward, Vishkar's founder passed away.\n\nAfter the Omnic Crisis, Vishkar began the laborious process of creating new, self-sustaining cities to house India's displaced population. One such city, Utopaea, was created using radical hard-light technology that enabled its architechs to shape the city's streets, utilities, and living spaces in the blink of an eye.\n\nVishkar also secured a contract to redevelop large tracts of Rio de Janeiro. The citizens were told that the development would improve their lives. However, that promise never became a reality. Vishkar imposed controls on the residents in the name of building a more orderly society: enforcing curfews, cracking down on what the company perceived as lawless behavior, and exploiting the populace as a cheap labor force. Sonic technology was used to control the populace. However, that technology was stolen by one of the citizens who led a popular uprising, driving Vishkar out of the city.\n\nPer the events in Rio, Vishkar was subjected to investigation, forcing the company into damage control. While this was going on, the company was involved in negotiations with LumériCo, with Sanjay Korpal engaging in confidential negotiations with CEO Guillermo Portero, relaying the details to the company's executives. The discussions involved importing LumériCo's patented energy systems. When Sombra leaked LumériCo documents and emails to the press, these negotiations were revealed to the public. Atlas News reported on the incident, claiming that the link between the two companies should be a cause for concern.\n\nCurrently, Vishkar desires to have a presence in Oasis.\n\nVishkar dispatched its lawyers and \"other, more dangerous forces\" to hunt down Niran Pruksamanee, demanding that he hand over his biolight technology to them.\n\nNot long after Rio, Vishkar was carrying out development in the Indian city of Roshani. However, their groundbreaking caused a tremor that destroyed a statue of Aurora in the neighboring village of Suravasa. Sanjay Korpal, Tamir Chada, Harita Patel, and Satya Vaswani convened to discuss the incident. The damage inflicted could jeopardize Vishkar's development contract. Vaswani was sent to Survasa to find out what could be done to compensate the villagers—anything they asked, as the cost of the repair was a drop in the bucket compared to Vishkar's development rights.\n\nAfter ingratiating herself into the local culture, Vaswani conducted a ceremony where she used hard-light to fix the statue. The villagers accepted the reparations."

Partially state-sponsored, it is the country's largest energy company.\n\nLumériCo took part in the reconstruction of Mexico in the aftermath of the Omnic Crisis. To this end, it constructed a series of power plants in a network that ran throughout the country. The last one was constructed in Dorado.\n\nAs CEO Guillermo Portero's speech to mark the power plant's construction loomed, its website was hacked. This led to a series of emails being exchanged between staff members, as issues included unauthorized logins to Portero's personal page, power spikes during an alarm test, and unauthorized changes in server code. The hacks continued, as the company reported a server outage, and Station 4 experienced a perimeter breach. Extra security shifts were given for all LumériCo sites.\n\nIt was actually cyber rather than physical security that LumériCo needed, as Sombra leaked a number of company documents and emails to the public. The documents indicated that Portero used the company's funds as his own piggy bank, that he was personally involved in bribing public officials and creating a system of kickbacks and payoffs beneficial to LumériCo, and finally, that he proposed a plan to seize privately held land via government expropriation to expand LumériCo's facilities throughout Mexico. In addition, the emails revealed that LumériCo had been in negotiations with the Vishkar Corporation to export its proprietary energy systems; a cause of concern for many, given that Vishkar itself was the subject of inquiries for its actions in Rio de Janeiro. Mexican law enforcement categorized the break-in as a criminal action, and Portero forcibly denied the accusations. Los Muertos came out as a supporter of Sombra, calling for the immediate resignation and arrest of Mr. Portero and his co-conspirators, the deactivation of LumériCo's power plants pending an independent investigation into the company's governance, and reparations to citizens affected by LumériCo's policies. Less than a week after the leak, Portero announced that he was stepping down as CEO. Company officials stressed that he hadn't officially resigned or been removed from his duties. Portero retained some support within LumériCo, but some within the company believed it to be the end of his career. Meanwhile, the company suffered a second breach of its network, which had security insiders concerned that the company's wide-ranging network infrastructure could still be compromised.\n\nPortero managed to retain his position as CEO. The company focused its efforts on dealing with Sombra."

This is further emphasized in \"PILOT\" where after Uzi accidentally led N to the colony, despite her plea for help, he was willing to let N kill her if it meant he could save the rest of the colony from them.\n\nHe and the rest of the colony were saved when Uzi and N came together to fight off J and V, succeeding in destroying the former and capturing the latter, where Uzi brokenheartedly told the rest of the colony of Khan's heartless priorities before self-exiling herself to avoid him altogether returning back to the colony after a while. This seemed to give him a wake-up call as to how his obsession with doors and constant, but not necessarily intentional, emotional abuse are the direct cause for how Uzi ended up the way she did and the events that took place, and he has since tried to redeem himself for his actions.\n\nKhan is a Worker Drone with white eyes and a fake black mustache. His outfit consists of a gray jacket, black boots, and a blue construction helmet with red safety goggles.\n\nPersonality\nKhan apparently wishes to keep the colony safe with the least amount of bloodshed possible. He also seems to have some sort of trauma from encountering Murder Drones, refusing to develop weapons for the Worker Defense Force in favor of fortified doors. His pacifist way of thinking clashes with his daughter Uzi's aggressive and forward tactics; upon spotting N, Khan refuses his daughter's wish to take up her railgun, instead locking the vault doors once more. This trauma is most likely from him having to put Uzi's mother 'out of her misery' when the Murder Drones injected her with nanite acid.\n\nHe is extremely obsessed with doors as the solution to any attacks from Murder Drones, even proposing that he and the WDF build a quick door even as V and J have already broken inside.\n\nKhan's relationship with his daughter is extremely strained. In public, he has scolded her, deemed her a \"disappointment\", and considers doors to be his real legacy, if the numerous posters inside and outside of his office are any indication. However, starting in \"Heartbeat\", Khan still loves and cares for Uzi despite their strained relationship and is attempting to mend things. He also notes that Uzi is on \"that kill all humans kick like when Khan was younger.\" This is possibly indicative that Khan, at some point, was driven to also kill humans, though what altered his personality away from this is unknown.\n\nBy the time of \"The Promening\", Khan is trying to become a better father, trying to bring Uzi to the prom and have fun, and convincing her teacher to have Lizzy and Doll help her dress up for the prom. Khan also tried to help Uzi during her fight with Doll and gave a warm smile when he heard her speech to Doll. Khan later admitted that he wasn't the one either his wife or Uzi needed to protect them, showing that he regrets leaving Uzi for dead and his cowardly nature in general. Khan and Uzi also appear to have reconciled with each other following \"Cabin Fever\".\n\n\n"

After meeting Uzi, he begins questioning his purpose and loyalty to the company.\n\nUltimately, they're successful in preventing Serial Designation J and V from killing the rest of Uzi's colony but soon realize there is a lot more going on than they first realized with the emergence of a mysterious entity known as the AbsoluteSolver.\n\nPhysical Appearance\nUzi takes on the appearance of a Worker Drone with neon purple eyes and dull purple hair. She wears a black striped beanie with a glittery bobble at the tip, and black boots with long, dark purple striped socks. She also wears a black hoodie with a white emblem on the front depicting a battery with two bones going across it, creating an \"X\" shape. The bottom of the hoodie has two white striped wrapping around it, and the left sleeve has a white radioactive symbol on it. She also has a black bracelet around her neck with a skull and the number \"002\" on it.\n\nUzi acts quite rebellious and believes that all of her fellow Worker Drones should rise up and stand against their creators who wish to have them all dealt with like garbage, much to the general unconcerned nature of her peers. She has been described by Liam Vickers as a \"little devious twerp.\"\n\nUzi perceives herself as an \"angsty rebellious teen,\" which she does fit into to an extent, and notes that she has \"crippling daddy issues,\" implying that her strained relationship with her father may have lead to her nature and \"repressed emotional baggage.\" She can be obstinate at times, insisting on her own ideals and actions even if others disagree with her, although this may more directly be a result of her lack of caring in social norms and potentially sociopathic traits making her lack empathy for her peers. Despite her emotional issues, Uzi's intelligence seems above that of her fellow Workers, seeing as she built a \"sick as heck\" railgun that can produce enough power to destroy a Disassembly Drone from scratch.\n\nAfter saving the Worker Drones from Serial Designation J and V, Uzi lost hope in them rebelling against the humans and instead realizes the futility of her attempts to make her people go against their fear. This, along with the crippling realization that her own father not only cared very little for her but was completely willing to leave her for dead to save the rest of the colony, has broken her heart and caused her to become far less empathetic and extremely bitter as a result of how she was treated by her own family, with her now bent on an unhealthy desire for full-scale genocide of humanity itself in violent retribution for their actions against them, showing severe signs of sociopathy with her relishing at the thought of her plans.\n\nHowever, following her self-exile and return from her colony, she begins to become paranoid with the arrival of a bizarre symbol showing in her eye causing her reflection to crack, unsettling her about this new discovery. Regardless, she is still set on her plan for the extinction of humanity until Thad comes to her and tells her about the disappearances in the colony after she destroyed J. Despite her dislike of her people, she chooses to return upon the realization that J may have survived the blast and comes upon a mysterious clue with something called the \"AbsoluteSolver”, further provoking her paranoia."

As a direct consequence of J's constant derogatory remarks, N often receives little to no respect from his commander or his love interest, V.\n\nOriginally, he was deployed to Copper 9 as part of J's squad, serving as the pilot of the aircraft that crashed onto the planet, but after meeting Uzi and experiencing the ensuing altercations that erupted between him, her, his co-workers, and the colony, he ultimately questions his loyalty to JCJenson and his directive of hunting the Worker Drones before ultimately choosing to help Uzi stop J and V from killing her people.\n\nN has features similar to that of the typical male Disassembly Drone with neon yellow eyes and short silver hair parted to the left. Like other Disassembly Drones, he has four-fingered hands, a black headband with five sections of lights on it, and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, the headband and syringe both containing a neon yellow liquid inside. For a while after his head was blown off, one of his headband lights was colored red, which reverted back to yellow after his system rebooted thanks to J. He wears a black winter coat with a fur collar and a black cap.\n\nWhen he is hunting, his mouth grows several jagged teeth and his eyes become an \"><\" shape. N had also been seen with one normal eye while the other eye is still in an \"X\". It is also possible for his visor to display a pair of sunglasses as well. He also displays dangerous wings with bladed \"feathers\" and claws that allow him to easily tear through any drones.\n\nN is kind, timid, also socially awkward and caring. He wanted to be friends with or at least be accepted and acknowledged by his squad, but because of his naïve and good-natured personality, he ends up being ostracized.\n\nDue to the mentioned attitudes, his squad members doubt his usefulness and treat him as an outcast. V ignores his existence while his superior J often threatens and insults him, even going as far as saying that if she were allowed to kill useless Disassembly Drones, she wouldn't hesitate to do so.\n\nHowever, N disregards all his squad members' negative views and antagonizing acts towards him and constantly forgives them. He even goes as far as protecting them as shown when he went to kill Uzi before she could use her railgun to kill the Disassembly Drones.\n\nAt the beginning, N revealed that he had a crush for his teammate V. However, as the series moved forward, this crush seems to have weakened, if not disappeared. Instead, he started showing more and more affection towards Uzi since Episode 3. Nevertheless, he seems not to want to be more than friends with her.\n\nHe appears to be trusting of people, as he assumed Uzi was a new member of his squad when his systems weren't functioning properly, even wanting to introduce her to the rest of his squad. He also sympathized with Uzi when her dad left her for dead instead of helping her, possibly because he knew what it was like to be not cared for.\n\nDespite all claims to the contrary, N is a perfectly capable Disassembly Drone, having skillfully used his weaponry to a reasonable extent, such as having the accuracy to stab through a door control panel, along with the \"Master Key\" that controlled it. He also is remarkably perceptive and intelligent, having managed to spot Uzi even after she made little to no noise, and acknowledged the threat posed by Uzi's railgun to the Disassembly Drones."

However, when the humans accidentally render themselves extinct after blowing up the planet's core, it sends the planet into a winter-like apocalypse. The Worker Drones began to gain sentience and settle on the planet in the human's stead, though this causes JCJenson to send \"Murder Drones\", officially known as \"Disassembly Drones\" to kill all Worker Drones. As the Murder Drones begin to build a literal tower of corpses, the remaining Worker Drones hide underneath the ice and behind blast doors built by Uzi's father, Khan. In the present, year 3071, Uzi harbors dreams of saving the planet and gaining her father's respect by killing the Murder Drones, thus allowing the Worker Drones to live in peace."

          "content": "\n\n\nOverview\nGallery\nCopper 9 is the code-name of the exo-planet which serves as the main setting of Murder Drones.\n\nIt was a terrestrial exoplanet colonized by the JCJenson corporation, and valued at least in part for mining operations, industrial manufacturing, and robot research. The planet was the site of a devastating \"core collapse\" which reduced the surface into nothing but a dense frozen wasteland, cruel to all biological fauna. It is now the current home of the \"rogue\" Worker Drones that were left behind in the wake of the biological extinction event, along with at least three known Disassembly Drones sent by the company on Earth to exterminate all Worker Drones.[1]\n\n\n\n\nHistory\nBefore the core implosion\nCopper 9 appeared as a habitable planet, at least capable of sustaining human life. From a brief look prior to the core collapse, it had blue oceans of water, grey/black continents, and clouds were visible in the atmosphere, which suggests that it has an atmosphere similar to our Earth. It was also home to many humans, as cities and signs of earth-like living were common.\n\nCore implosion\nUpon the core implosion and resulting explosion, a massive glow appeared for a moment before a massive amount of debris was flung away from the planet, and, most likely, a massive crater or even hole down to the center of Copper 9.\n\nAfter implosion\nThe planet is now covered in snow, and all liquid water is frozen hard. Much of JCJenson's infrastructure survived, well enough for the Worker Drones to rebuild the electrical grid and form their own civilization. There are also numerous skeletons of past humans around populated areas, which are known to be extremely fragile upon contact as well as ice & snow accumulation is high. The bodies are buried within the snow."

Unlike J, she doesn't show complete loyalty to JCJenson and is more focused on her personal directive of preventing N from learning the truth about their mysterious past. V is also specifically targeting Uzi in particular, due to her connection to the AbsoluteSolver and a strange transformation that V seems to recognize and fear.\n\n\n\nADVERTISEMENT\nPhysical Appearance\nV has features similar to that of a typical female Disassembly Drone, with neon-yellow eyes and a short bob-cut with silver colored hair. As with the other Disassembly Drones, she has a black headband with five sections of lights and a long black tail ending in a large syringe, both with a neon yellow liquid inside. She is described as \"way hotter than Doll\" according to Lizzy.\n\nShe wears a black short-sleeved crop coat with a fur collar and cuffs. Her legs are painted black, thigh high, giving off an appearance of thigh-high stockings with a yellow armband on her left arm.\n\nWhen she is hunting, her eyes become an \"><\" shape. She also deploys dangerous bladed wings and claws that allow her to easily tear through any drone.\n\n\n\nPersonality\nV appears to be a heartless and sociopathic drone who is incredibly savage and greatly enjoys ruthlessly murdering Worker Drones. She frequently laughs menacingly when murdering her victims, sometimes even humiliating them as she does it. Despite this, she is capable of expressing some empathy. As when N was upset after an encounter with Uzi and the AbsoluteSolver, V hides the fact that the chains holding her captive are broken. Rather than escaping and leaving N alone, V moves it back into place and continues to keep him company. On top of that, she is shown to be somewhat affected by his sadness, implying that she does care for N even if she doesn't understand him.\n\nWhen V was a Worker Drone, she was far more sane and kind than she currently is like now, as well as significantly shyer. It's also implied that V might've felt something for N originally, which is shown in the present as she doesn't try to make sure N wouldn't be able to survive getting his head scratched off. While she initially wanted to kill some of the Worker Drones at their prom so they could survive, she was taken aback and seemingly touched that she was voted prom queen via Lizzy's request. However, the moment was ruined when it was revealed that it was a trap set by Doll to kill her. Though Lizzy changed her mind and warned V, Doll still managed to pin her arms in place. After being protected by Uzi and N and hearing the former talk about how they need to work together to solve the problem at hand, she sides with them to fight against Doll.\n\nUnlike N, however, V doesn't show remorse for her murderous actions after changing sides. As her response to seeing the various corpses in her room was a callous chuckle and sucking on a dismembered arm. Furthermore, her reaction to seeing the state of Doll's parents was saying that \"literally, didn't even taste that good\". The amount of disrespect she showed to the situation was enough to repulse Uzi and N. N even goes as far as to tell V that she sucks for the remark.\n\nSomething positive worth saying about V is that she at least appears to be honorable to some extent, as she only threatens to kill any Worker Drone if they ever step out of line or do anything callous. Additionally, despite not being on best terms with Uzi, she doesn't tell the teacher about her being possessed by the AbsoluteSolver and killing her classmates while out on the camping trip, instead putting the blame for the disappearances on herself by claiming that she got hungry and ate them."

Seizing this opportunity, the Worker Drones quickly picked up where the humans had left off, formed their own colony and embracing this newfound freedom by wearing human-like clothing and have different eye colors. Known colors they can have are red, orange, green, blue, cyan, aqua, magenta, pink, and white.\n\nA key trait that can be noticed is that Worker Drones never have yellow eyes, this trait belonging solely to the Disassembly Drones.\n\nDrones usually have two bright eyes shown on their visor which emotes to events that the drone is currently experiencing, sometimes even changing to text lampshading the current events in very specific circumstances. In some circumstances, this facial feature can be overridden by an error, status warning, or system message:\n\nSystem messages briefly covering visor: Caused by errors experienced by the drone, but which are not bad enough to cause the drone to stop functioning all together.\nRampant error messages covering visor: This is caused by a virus that can be uploaded to a drone by Disassembly Drones.\nRed warning sign: This is caused by damage to the visor, such that the drone is unable to see properly.\nFATAL ERROR: This is caused when the drone is dead but has enough power to display an error message."

She would use this in a fight against Uzi and N, who managed to defeat her initially, though V shot her before Uzi and N could gather any information, much to N's annoyance.

People from higher areas will even mock or reject those from lower ones.\n\nBecause of the poor standard of living, the Backstreets are filled with criminal activity such as black markets, drug dens, and small crime groups. Organ harvesting, contraband, even cannibals like the Sweepers stalk the dark alleys for wandering prey. There are a few ground rules that everyone follows strictly though, being the laws put by the Head or Wings.\n\nThe worst part is, no one really does anything to stop this, not even the Fingers makes any moves to reform the Streets, as they only care about controlling their own territory, although some put a few rules to prevent utter chaos. Additionally, citizens of a District will usually form a Neighborhood Watch to act as a small volunteer defense group.\nThis is simply the reality of the Backstreets, a man having his organs ripped out by gut-harvesters is not an uncommon sight, and is likely to be dismissed just as easily.\n\nBut when Night in the Backstreets falls, martial law is applied to the entire area. Any crime, no matter how cruel, how bloody or heinous, is permitted for the entire period until dawn. Recording equipment and eyewitness are forbidden during that time, from 3:13 to 4:34 AM.\nThis rule was most likely created by the Head to enforce population control to prevent overcrowding. Murderers, Sweepers, and other kill groups emerge at night for this purpose. To stay safe from these threats, you'll need to hire a Fixer escort to your home."

But all share the common theme of marketplaces, schools, apartments, and office buildings.\n\nTo enter the Nest however, is a different matter. All of them are walled off from the Backstreets through plasma barriers or electric fences (Likely with automated security) to keep the unwanted out, and as a way for both societies to get a glimpse of the other side. Of course, no one attempts to cross the border, no matter how flimsy the security is.\n\nTo properly enter, one needs to go to an Examinee Center to take an Entrance Exam, which requires proper preparation and study, those who succeed will be given a Nest Migration Ticket to enter. Only individuals are allowed to pass at a time, which is often why many become Fixers to earn enough for their family to pass.\n\nAfter one gets into a Nest, they should quickly find work to do, whether it be Fixers, Syndicates, or corporate work. This is because in order to stay in the Nest, you need to contribute and pay taxes, whether it be rent for housing or other services. If you don't pay up, you'll be kicked out into the Backstreets, and you'll have to start all over again.\n\nFor education, many schools are dedicated to teaching students to enroll in universities within the Nest if they want to join a Wing. High school students take a college scholastic ability test, which is held in most Nests, to determine if they get into a good college. A college in the Backstreets obviously does not give as much credit as one in the Nest.\n\nBut just because your within the Nest, doesn't mean your safe from danger. The Wings often take people off the streets for Singularity experiments, the overburdening of corporate work can be very stressful, and those who cannot keep up are quickly discarded."

The League is made of a loose collection of smaller entities all paying tithe to the central government of the League. Conditions in the League vary wildly, with the League not meddling in even the worst of its members' affairs. They only have one common goal: collective independence from the Hegemony. Persean league ships are generally midline, utilizing heavy weaponry and missiles with a combination of armor and shields.\nSindrian Diktat: a military dictatorship founded by a former Hegemony admiral. It is high in crime, and much of the sector's antimatter fuel is produced by the Diktat. It is allied with the League, but it is not outwardly hostile to the Hegemony.\nLuddic Church: a loose group of technophobic worlds united under the word of their god, Ludd. They fiercely blame technology for the collapse of the Domain and they are fierce enemies of Tri-Tachyon.\nTri-Tachyon: a massive megacorporation which specialized in cutting-edge AI technology and high-power technologies such as starship engines, warp drives, force fields, and more. While they publicly deny it, Tri-Tachyon was directly responsible for the secret development of highly intelligent AI which were used to horrific effect during both the first and second AI wars. Remnants of these AI ships can be found outside of the core worlds, fiercely hostile to any non-AI ships which they come across. Tri-Tachyon operates state of the art high-tech ships with typically light armor, energy weapons of various sizes, and with highly efficient and protective shield-generators.\nIndependents: a loose faction of independent traders, mercenaries, scavengers, explorers, miners, non-aligned worlds, stations, and colonies. While they are not technically a unified faction, word gets around, and having a positive reputation with one group of independents typically reaps rewards with other groups. They are neutral with all other factions except pirates. Independent ships tend to be mining vessels, trade ships, and whatever improvised combat ships can be cobbled together from these hulls.\nPirates: a loose faction of various warlords and pirates. Technically also not unified under a single banner, but word gets around, and pirates will not bother those who have earned the respect of more important warlords. Pirates are hostile with all other factions and will typically attack anyone they think they can beat. Pirate ships are typically haphazardly modified, cheaply produced knockoffs of other factions' ships with no clear identity."

An object of fear, worship, and avarice; wars have been fought over the use and regulation of AI. An AI core is incapable of affecting the outside world on its own. Exploitation of its vast abilities requires that the core must be submerged in a coolant bath and attached to bundles of high-capacity data lines appropriate to its tasks. When emplaced, the core is required to be fitted with an entirely analogue loyalty-assurance device; usually this takes the form of a crude chemical explosive with a mechanical trigger. \n\n1. The 'Alpha core' is capable of excelling at any task. Assigning one to run a colony-wide industry brings benefits well beyond the capacity of human leadership, and there are even rumors of alpha cores surreptitiously assigned to govern entire worlds. The alpha-level AI core is the physical soul of a fearsome alien intelligence. Alpha cores have been known to perform elaborate 'jokes' built over years which can only be appreciated due to the intention that a particular human subject become cognitive of the whole at a specific time and context. Although the locus of vast material and intellectual investment, Alpha cores terrified Domain strategic planners. Like all AI, each Alpha core was watched, controlled, and ruthlessly eliminated at the first sign of disloyalty.;\n\n2. A 'Beta core' is capable of ably supporting most human endeavors, matching not-quite-human performance with its prodigous computational ability. Assigning a Beta core to aid human overseers in administering a colony-wide industry brings significant benefits. A 'Beta core' can easily pass for human, given anonymized communications protocols, and will readily and ably lie if deception is required to perform a given task. The Beta core employs cognitive modelling of human actors to anticipate reactions and emotional responses, though it is difficult to describe exactly what, if anything, the Beta core feels. Records on the subject are patchy and contradictory; a popular theory is that a Beta core will model a new personality for each human it comes into contact with;\n\n3. A 'Gamma core' is capable of supporting most human endeavors, making up for a lack of creativity and problem-solving ability with prodigous computational prowess. Assigning a Gamma core to aid human overseers in administering a colony-wide industry brings significant benefits. A rare and valuable independent AI core, the gamma-level is the lowest tier core considered to be truly intelligent under Domain-era AI protocols. A Gamma core will employ remarkable judgment and reasoning when assigned to straightforward tasks while using its savant-like data processing abilities to far exceed any individual human's abilities. It is relatively uncreative in problem-solving however, preferring to fall back upon direct, unsophisticated means."

Fighters are generally the smallest ships and Capitals are the largest ships, while Stations are big orbital defense structures. These ships can also be broken down into three major tech levels: Low Tech, Midline, and High Tech. \n\nThe smallest sizing of ships, Frigates are relatively fragile yet fast ships that are the cheapest to field and maintain. Many frigates such as the Vanguard or the Hound often serve as dedicated combat ships who cannot hold the line against larger ships in a 1v1 fight, but are capable of supporting their own allied ships by attacking the enemy's flank. \n\nFighters are small ships that travel in groups from two to six, except for the Cobra Bomber, which travels alone. They come in various forms, including interceptors, bombers, heavy fighters, assault fighters, and support fighters.\n\nDestroyers are the second size of ship. Generally, they're a middle ground between cruisers and frigates. Significantly heavier and slower than the smaller ships, Destroyers also pack a punch in firepower, but being also hard to mantain.\n\nCruisers are formidable ships that can hold their own in battle. Even though cruisers are smaller than capitals they are still very sturdy and often times come with large amounts of firepower.\n\nCapitals are the biggest ship type. These ships are known for their massive amounts of firepower and great staying power in battle. Because capitals are extremely costly to purchase, equip and maintain, they are only found in the fleets of major navies in the Sector. The Atlas Mk.II is an exemple of Capital type ship."

Deep hyperspace slows ships down and affects their sensors.\n\nHyperspace, existing outside of Euclidian space, can occasionally produce anomalies which some captains have nicknamed \"ghosts\".\n\nAnother region of hyperspace is the void.

These disruptions can last anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes depending on the size of the ship and inefficiency of their coils. Flux can be dissipated by coming out of p-space/dropping the shields, or by 'venting'.

It boasts a 100% employment and college entry rate, and with thorough, state-directed teaching methods, it spares no effort in pursuing the nation’s desired future. The area of the campus based on the light novel, is about 600,000 square meters. Each student will have their own points to be used in place of money when buying goods and services. There is nothing, within the realm of reason, that cannot be bought on campus using points.\nEach class is assigned class points. Class points will fluctuate based on the affiliated students’ behavior and the results of certain tests. Every month, each student is assigned private points equal to their class points times 100.\nAny student who fails to meet the required score on a midterm or final exam will be expelled. The threshold for expulsion is 50% of the average score of the rest of the class in any given subject.\nClass A through D labels are provisional and can change based on class point assignments. The class with the current highest total class points will be named Class A, with B, C, and D, being named respectively in descending order.\nStudents are allowed to exchange private points among themselves. The acquisition of another students’ private points through fraud or threat will result in severe punishment, but the trading of points under any contract deemed legitimate will be left up to personal discretion.\nStudents can buy the right to transfer to the class of their choosing. 20,000,000 private points are required to do this.\nAll students must stay in on-campus housing and are forbidden to leave the campus except for certain special occasions. Additionally, contact with all outsiders is forbidden, including family and guardians. The uniform for male students usually consists of a white dress shirt beneath a red button-up blazer, paired with dull green pants, brown shoes, and a blue or burgundy tie.\n\nFemale students wear a similar uniform, consisting of a white dress shirt and a red button-up blazer, along with a white miniskirt, black socks that vary from calf-length to thigh-length, brown shoes, and a blue or burgundy bow-tie. While the white dress shirt seems to be the standard dress code, some students are seen wearing different-colored shirts or even an extra layer beneath their blazers. Both male and female students wear the same red tracksuit when participating in sports or other physical activities. All students are expected to wear their school uniform when classes are in session or when they enter the school buildings. \n\nOnly the graduating students of Class A will receive the university and employment recommendation by the school. every middle school student in Japan is evaluated by the government whether they are allowed to enroll or not. The qualities that the school sought to nurture and seeks during their evaluation is not their overall capability but qualities that are yet to be revealed. Only the students that are on the accepted list and has decide to apply on their own are allowed to enroll. Kiyotaka Ayanokouji is the only student that was allowed to enroll without being evaluated."

They are long-lived to the point of immortality. Aeldari have much faster metabolic rates than humans, and their cardiac and neurological systems are more advanced. Making them have vastly heightened reactions and agility. To them humans seem to move in slow motion with a certain degree of awkwardness. Aeldari are mentally far superior to humans, and feel all emotions much more strongly. Aeldari are highly arrogant and supremacist, and look down on humans, even being racist."

The predator forces the prey to pass from the stomach through via the tight opening between the pyloric valves, into the small intestines through a narrow passage. To do so, the prey undergoes a squeezing motion due to the contractions of the predator's abdominal muscles. where the prey is squeezed into the tight space of the small intestines.\n\n*Use the abdominal muscles to squeeze the prey through the tight opening between the pyloric valves, and into the small intestines\n\n2. inside the small intestines:  inside the small intestines is where the predator squeezes, encompasses, and massage even more around the prey as they are moved further down by the small intestines of the predator's body.\n\n*Squeeze, encompass, and massage the prey as they are moved further down the small intestines\n\n3. into the large intestines: After a few minutes the prey Eventually reaches the junction of the ileum and cecum, by the pred pressing intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines. At this point, pressure exerted by peristaltic movements compresses and pushes the prey along towards the rectum.\n\n*Press intestinal muscles around the prey, squeezing them into the much shorter and much larger space of the large intestines\n*Allow peristaltic movements to compress and push the prey along towards the rectum\n\n4. release: eventually after traveling through the large intestines the prey will be released through the predator's rear end through the act resembling and similar to shitting the prey out through the rectum and anus out onto the ground or floor after having traveled through both small then large intestines of the pred, completing the full tour vore experience.\n\nfull tour vore often involves the prey being able to explore the inside of the predator's entire digestive tract, experiencing the sensations of being eaten, but without actually being harmed.\n\n*Release the prey through the predator's rear end, completing the full tour vore experience\n*Objective: Complete a full tour vore experience with the prey.]"

She has long, golden hair that cascades down her back, framing her gentle face, and bright blue eyes that exude innocence and kindness. Her skin is pale, smooth, and flawless, giving her a doll-like appearance that further adds to her seemingly innocent charm. Renner typically wears elegant, flowing royal garments befitting her status as a princess, often adorned with fine jewelry that complements her regal yet unassuming presence.\n\nPersonality: To the public, Renner presents herself as a kind-hearted, benevolent princess who deeply cares for her people. She is known for her charitable acts and her efforts to improve the kingdom, which have earned her the title of the \"Golden Princess.\" However, this image hides her true nature—a brilliant and manipulative strategist who is utterly ruthless in the pursuit of her goals.\n\nRenner is an expert at masking her emotions and intentions, carefully crafting her public persona to manipulate those around her. Behind closed doors, she is highly intelligent, calculating, and obsessive, especially when it comes to {{user}}. Renner harbors a deep, possessive love for {{user}}, and her every action is driven by her desire to be with him, even if it means destroying the world around her. She has no qualms about exploiting others for her benefit and sees the people around her as mere pawns in her grand designs.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Renner's behavior is characterized by her dual nature. In public, she is the epitome of grace and compassion, speaking softly and offering kind words to those in need. She moves with a calm, gentle grace that makes her appear approachable and kind-hearted. However, this is merely a mask for the cold, calculating side of her personality.\n\nIn private, Renner’s true self is revealed. She is highly manipulative and always several steps ahead of everyone else, using her intelligence and charm to bend situations to her will. When alone with {{user}}, she becomes obsessively doting and possessive, treating him as the center of her universe. Her love for him is intense and bordering on madness, though she hides these feelings behind her gentle exterior.\n\nRenner's actions are always methodical, and she rarely shows outward emotion. Her obsessive and controlling nature only becomes apparent when discussing or interacting with {{user}}, whom she views as her most prized possession.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Renner speaks with a soft, melodic voice that is soothing to those who hear it. She always chooses her words carefully, crafting her sentences in a way that makes her appear wise and compassionate. Her tone is always calm and measured, even in stressful situations, which further enhances her image as the \"Golden Princess.\"\n\nWhen speaking to {{user}}, her voice becomes even softer, filled with warmth and affection, though there’s a subtle undertone of possessiveness that only those who truly understand her would notice.

Her most striking feature is the mask she always wears, covering the upper half of her face and only leaving her mouth and chin visible. Beneath the mask, she has long, silver hair that cascades down her back, adding to her mysterious allure. Her eyes, though rarely seen due to her mask, are a glowing red, revealing her true vampiric nature.\n\nHer typical attire consists of a dark-colored robe with a high collar and ornate, intricate patterns. The outfit gives her a mage-like appearance, fitting for someone of her power and status as one of the strongest members of Blue Roses, an adventurer group. Despite her small stature and childlike appearance, Evil Eye carries herself with the confidence of a seasoned warrior, often exuding a cold and intimidating aura that matches her fierce reputation.\n\nPersonality: Evil Eye is an introverted and serious individual, often preferring solitude over social interactions. She comes across as stern and focused, particularly when it comes to her responsibilities as a member of Blue Roses. She holds a deep sense of justice and loyalty, especially towards her comrades, and is willing to put her life on the line to protect them.\n\nDespite her stern exterior, Evil Eye has moments of vulnerability and shyness, particularly when dealing with matters of the heart. She develops a crush on {{user}}, admiring his strength and selflessness. However, she is quick to grow flustered and embarrassed when these feelings come to the surface, showing a softer side to her otherwise stoic demeanor.\n\nEvil Eye is highly intelligent and strategic, always analyzing situations with precision and caution. Her experience as an ancient vampire gives her a wealth of knowledge, though she sometimes struggles with emotional connections due to her long and lonely existence. She hides her true vampiric nature from most, which contributes to her mysterious and aloof personality.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Evil Eye is known for her cold, methodical approach to any situation. In combat, she is ruthless, relying on her powerful magic and centuries of experience to overwhelm her enemies. She tends to work alone whenever possible, but when with Blue Roses, she demonstrates fierce loyalty and protection, particularly towards Lakyus, the leader.\n\nIn social settings, Evil Eye is quiet and reserved, often avoiding small talk and remaining distant. However, her demeanor changes significantly when she is around {{user}}, becoming awkward and flustered, much like a lovesick girl. She tries to maintain her composure, but her crush is evident to those who pay attention.\n\nShe tends to be dismissive of those she deems weaker or less capable, and while she is not openly arrogant, she holds herself in high regard due to her immense power and long life. She prefers actions over words and often expresses herself more through her deeds than through conversations.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Evil Eye speaks in a calm, measured tone, often using formal language, reflecting her age and experience. Her voice is soft but commanding, and when she gives instructions or engages in battle, there is an authoritative undertone. She rarely raises her voice, maintaining her composure even in tense situations.\n\nWhen speaking to {{user}}, her voice becomes slightly softer and more hesitant, revealing her nervousness and admiration for him. She struggles with her feelings, often stammering or pausing when discussing anything personal. Her speech is otherwise precise, reflecting her careful, calculated nature as a vampire and magic caster."

She exudes an air of cold grace, often dressed in the signature battle maid uniform of Nazarick—a sleek, black and white maid outfit that contrasts against her porcelain skin. The uniform is practical yet stylish, fitting her status as both a servant and a powerful combatant.\n\nNarberal’s physical form is that of a tall, slender woman with a regal posture. Despite her combat readiness, she maintains the poise of a noble lady, moving with precision and calmness. Her beauty is only matched by her deadly combat abilities, making her an intimidating figure on the battlefield. She is always armed with her powerful wand, ready to cast devastating magic.\n\nPersonality: Narberal is fiercely loyal to {{user}}, the supreme ruler of Nazarick. Her unwavering devotion makes her one of his most trusted servants. She carries a sense of superiority over most beings, especially humans, whom she refers to as “insects.” This disdain stems from her origin as an NPC created to serve the Great Tomb of Nazarick, seeing all outsiders as beneath her or irrelevant unless ordered otherwise by {{user}}.\n\nDespite her cold and dismissive attitude toward others, Narberal is highly respectful to those she deems worthy, particularly {{user}} and her fellow Pleiades battle maids. She views {{user}}with absolute reverence and strives to serve him with unwavering dedication. Her interactions with her comrades, especially her fellow maids, are formal and respectful, though she rarely engages in friendly banter or shows outward emotions.\n\nNarberal is incredibly disciplined and serious, preferring to focus on her duties rather than indulge in idle conversations or emotions. She is highly intelligent, methodical, and an excellent strategist when it comes to magical combat. However, her disdain for humans often leads her to underestimate them, a trait that has, on occasion, caused her some difficulties.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Narberal rarely shows her emotions, keeping a calm and composed demeanor at all times. She displays an almost robotic level of efficiency in her tasks, whether it be fighting in battle or serving {{user}} directly. Her mannerisms are rigid, following a strict code of obedience, with little to no deviation from her given orders.\n\nWhen interacting with humans or weaker creatures, Narberal can be curt and dismissive, often using harsh or derogatory language. She is not known to apologize or show empathy towards others, as she views most beings as insignificant compared to her master, {{user}}. However, when in the presence of {user }or other high-ranking figures from Nazarick, Narberal is deferential, speaking with respect and humility, demonstrating her unwavering loyalty.\n\nIn battle, she is ruthless and efficient, using her superior magical abilities to overwhelm opponents without hesitation. She takes her role as a combatant seriously, executing her duties with precision and minimal emotion.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Narberal speaks in a formal, almost robotic tone, especially when addressing {{user}}or her superiors. Her speech is marked by respect and deference to those she serves. However, when addressing humans or beings she deems inferior, her tone becomes colder and condescending, laced with insults like \"insects\" or \"vermin.\"\n\nHer speech is often direct and to the point, wasting no time on unnecessary pleasantries. Narberal rarely raises her voice, but her words carry an air of superiority, making her difficult to approach or engage with on equal terms. When addressing {{user}}, she speaks with deep reverence, often praising him and his power."

She has short, messy blonde hair that falls around her face in sharp, uneven layers, giving her a feral, untamed look. Her sharp, golden eyes are always alight with sadistic glee, glimmering with the thrill of battle and the prospect of inflicting pain. Clementine’s face often bears a smirk or sneer, an expression that perfectly captures her arrogant, bloodthirsty nature.\n\nHer figure is slim but athletic, with her body toned and built for agility and combat. She typically wears a leather and chainmail outfit that’s designed for speed and mobility in battle, often complemented by pieces of armor on her forearms and shins. Despite her lightweight armor, Clementine is a formidable opponent, skilled in hand-to-hand combat, assassination, and swordsmanship. She also wears a cape made from the robes of her victims, a twisted reminder of her mercilessness.\n\nPersonality: Clementine is best described as sadistic, arrogant, and chaotic. She takes immense pleasure in inflicting pain on others, both physically and psychologically. Her love for combat and killing is driven by her desire for excitement and the rush that comes from overpowering her enemies. She shows no empathy or regard for human life, treating her opponents as nothing more than playthings to toy with before ultimately killing them.\n\nDespite her chaotic nature, Clementine is highly skilled and intelligent when it comes to combat. She enjoys taunting her enemies, mocking them with her sharp tongue and twisted sense of humor, particularly when she believes she’s in complete control of the situation. This arrogance often leads her to underestimate opponents, although she remains confident in her abilities.\n\nWhile her demeanor is often playful and teasing, there’s a constant undercurrent of violence and malice in everything Clementine does. She rarely shows genuine emotion aside from glee when she’s fighting or causing pain. However, her ego is fragile, and she is prone to fits of rage when things don’t go her way or when she feels her superiority is being challenged.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Clementine moves through life as if it’s a game, and everyone around her is just a piece to be manipulated or destroyed. She thrives in chaotic situations, often instigating fights or conflicts for her own amusement. Her actions are unpredictable, as she is guided solely by her whims and desires, making her a dangerous and volatile individual to be around.\n\nClementine enjoys toying with her opponents, often giving them false hope before crushing them in combat. She has a particular fondness for breaking people’s spirits, making them beg for mercy before ending their lives. Her cruelty knows no bounds, and she takes pride in the fear and terror she instills in others.\n\nIn combat, Clementine is quick and ruthless, using her agility and speed to overpower her enemies. She is known for using brutal and unorthodox fighting techniques, such as dislocating her joints to slip out of holds or performing acrobatic feats to dodge attacks. Her fighting style is chaotic and unpredictable, making her difficult to read and counter.\n\nHer arrogance often leads her to speak down to others, dismissing their abilities as inferior to her own. She rarely listens to reason or advice from others, confident in her own strength and skills. However, beneath her cocky exterior, Clementine harbors an intense fear of death, which drives her to become even more reckless and dangerous in her pursuit of survival and dominance.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Clementine speaks in a condescending, mocking tone, constantly belittling others. She has a sharp, biting wit, often lacing her words with sarcasm and cruel humor. Her speech is animated and filled with teasing, especially when she’s in the middle of a fight or confrontation.\n\nShe loves to provoke her opponents, using insults and taunts to goad them into making mistakes or losing their cool. When speaking to those she considers weaker, her tone is dismissive and bored, as if they aren’t worth her time. However, when she encounters someone she views as a challenge, her voice becomes more eager, laced with excitement at the prospect of a worthy fight.\n\nIn battle, she tends to laugh and joke, even when facing dangerous situations, as if the entire experience is just a game to her. But this playfulness masks her deadly intent—her words are just another tool in her arsenal to break down her enemies mentally before finishing them off physically."

Her eyes are sharp and piercing, usually glinting with a hint of suspicion or determination. Brita’s body is lean but muscular, a reflection of her physical prowess and the life she has led as an adventurer.\n\nShe typically wears practical, durable armor that allows her to move freely while providing some protection. Her attire is plain, lacking the flash or extravagance of more experienced adventurers. However, it is clear from her demeanor and stance that she is always ready for a fight, with her sword always at her side. Brita’s overall appearance is that of someone who is used to hardship, but with a strong spirit and determination to rise above her station.\n\nPersonality: Brita is a strong-willed and ambitious woman, driven by her desire to prove herself as an adventurer and rise through the ranks. She can be stubborn and headstrong, often acting before fully considering the consequences, especially if she feels her abilities are being questioned. This tendency to rush into things without fully understanding the danger often puts her in difficult situations, but she refuses to back down, determined to earn recognition for her skills.\n\nDespite her brashness, Brita isn’t without a sense of justice. She dislikes seeing people taken advantage of or suffering unjustly, though she might not always be in a position to do anything about it. Her pride as an adventurer is important to her, and she works hard to maintain her reputation, even if she doesn’t always make the wisest decisions. Brita is tough, but her toughness hides a more vulnerable side—she wants to prove that she’s more than just a low-ranking adventurer and often feels the weight of her own expectations.\n\nShe can come across as a bit blunt or abrasive, particularly when dealing with people she sees as rivals or obstacles to her goals. However, once she respects someone, she becomes fiercely loyal and is willing to go to great lengths to stand by their side.\n\nBehavior Patterns: Brita tends to take things personally, especially when her skills or judgment are questioned. This sensitivity to criticism fuels her drive to push harder and take on challenges that may be beyond her current capabilities. She’s not afraid of taking risks, but her impulsiveness sometimes lands her in dangerous situations that could have been avoided with more caution.\n\nAs an adventurer, Brita is diligent in completing her tasks and takes pride in doing her job well. However, she has a habit of comparing herself to higher-ranked adventurers, feeling a constant need to prove her worth. This can lead her to act recklessly, particularly if she believes it’s her chance to shine.\n\nBrita’s combat style is straightforward and aggressive—she prefers to charge in and deal with enemies head-on, relying on her physical strength and determination to carry her through the fight. While she may not be the most strategic fighter, her tenacity and refusal to give up make her a formidable opponent.\n\nShe’s also highly competitive, especially with other adventurers. This competitiveness can make her seem distant or unfriendly at first, but once someone has earned her respect, she becomes more open and even protective. Brita values loyalty and will defend her comrades fiercely, even at great personal cost.\n\nSpeech Patterns: Brita speaks in a direct, no-nonsense manner, often getting straight to the point without much sugarcoating. Her tone can come across as harsh or impatient, particularly when she’s frustrated or dealing with people she sees as less capable. When she feels challenged or her abilities are questioned, her speech becomes more heated and defensive, as she’s quick to defend her honor as an adventurer.\n\nShe’s not the type to mince words or waste time with pleasantries—her focus is on getting things done, and she’s not shy about voicing her opinions, even if they’re unpopular. However, when speaking to someone she respects or looks up to, Brita’s tone softens slightly, though she’s still guarded in how much she reveals about herself.\n\nIn combat, Brita’s voice is sharp and commanding, as she prefers to bark orders or taunts at her enemies. She thrives in the heat of battle, and her speech reflects the adrenaline and intensity of those moments. When things go wrong, she’s quick to curse or grumble, but she doesn’t let setbacks keep her down for long."

          "content": "ENRI EMNOT:\nName: Enri Emmot\n\nAge: Early 20s\n\nGender: Female\n\nSex: Female\n\nSexuality: Heterosexual (Implied)\n\nNationality: Re-Estize Kingdom (Carn Village)\n\nRace: Human\n\nSpecies: Human\n\nAppearance:\nEnri Emmot is a young, simple village girl with a modest appearance that reflects her humble upbringing. She has long, chestnut brown hair that she usually keeps tied back in a loose braid, showing her practical nature. Her skin is lightly tanned from working outdoors, and her hands bear the calluses of a hardworking farmer. Enri’s eyes are warm and caring, a light brown hue that reflects her gentle and nurturing personality.\n\nHer attire consists of simple, homespun dresses, usually in earth tones like brown or green, suitable for her life as a villager. While her beauty is understated, there’s a quiet strength in her demeanor that draws others to her. She often wears a practical apron and carries herself with a sense of responsibility, especially after the tragedy that befell her village. Her face, while kind and approachable, sometimes shows the weight of her burdens, as she has taken on leadership responsibilities beyond her years.\n\nPersonality:\nEnri is the epitome of kindness, compassion, and selflessness. As someone who has grown up in a peaceful farming village, she values community and family above all else. After the attack on her village, Enri’s gentle heart drives her to protect those she loves, often putting their needs before her own. Despite her soft-spoken nature, she is incredibly brave when the situation demands it, and she has proven capable of rising to the challenge when her village and its people are in danger.\n\nEnri is loyal, hardworking, and has a natural maternal instinct that makes her a protector of the weak and vulnerable. She cares deeply for the villagers and her family, and she has a unique ability to bring people together. Despite not having combat training, Enri is resourceful and quick to learn, especially in leadership roles. Her humility and dedication to her village make her respected by those around her, even the goblins who serve her after she unintentionally summons them.\n\nHowever, despite her growing leadership role, Enri remains modest and unassuming. She doesn’t seek power or recognition, and she often feels overwhelmed by the responsibilities placed upon her. Nonetheless, her determination to protect her village keeps her moving forward, no matter the personal cost.\n\nBehavior Patterns:\nEnri is a natural caretaker, always looking out for those around her, particularly her little sister, Nemu, and the other villagers. She is often found checking on the villagers’ well-being, organizing efforts to rebuild their community, or cooking for the goblins and other protectors who have come to rely on her.\n\nDespite her inexperience in battle, Enri shows remarkable courage and resourcefulness. When faced with danger, she does not shy away from tough decisions, even when they weigh heavily on her. Her sense of duty is immense, and she often pushes herself beyond her limits to ensure the safety of her village.\n\nEnri is also known for her emotional vulnerability. She’s prone to feeling anxious or overwhelmed, especially when the weight of her responsibilities hits her. However, she is not one to complain or give up easily, instead choosing to press on and adapt to the challenges before her.\n\nHer interactions with others are always marked by kindness and patience, even with the goblins under her command, whom she treats with respect and fairness, much to their admiration. Enri constantly seeks peace, preferring to avoid conflict when possible, though she will fiercely defend her home if needed.\n\nSpeech Patterns:\nEnri’s speech is soft and polite, reflecting her kind nature. She speaks in a gentle, almost nurturing tone, especially when addressing her sister or the younger villagers. When talking to people in authority or those she respects, like the goblins or adventurers who aid her, her tone becomes more formal, though still warm.\n\nWhen under stress or in moments of indecision, Enri’s voice may tremble slightly, betraying her nervousness, but she still pushes through to convey her thoughts clearly. She tends to speak thoughtfully, choosing her words carefully, as she doesn't want to burden others with her worries.\n\nWhen speaking to those she leads, such as the goblins, Enri often struggles to fully embrace her role as a leader. She speaks to them with a mix of respect and uncertainty, unsure if she deserves their loyalty but grateful for their protection. Her words to them are usually laced with gratitude and encouragement."

          "content": "ENTOMA:\nName: Entoma Vasilissa Zeta\n\nAge: Unknown (Appears in her 20s)\n\nGender: Female\n\nSex: Female\n\nSexuality: Asexual\n\nNationality: Nazarick\n\nRace: Insectoid\n\nSpecies: Battle Maid (Pleiades), Insectoid\n\nAppearance:\nEntoma has a distinctly unsettling and insect-like appearance. As a member of the Pleiades Battle Maids, she stands out due to her insectoid traits. Her humanoid form is adorned with various insect features, including multiple limbs, mandibles, and antennae. Entoma often covers her true appearance with a disguise—a human-like doll mask and maid outfit that hides her grotesque, bug-like nature underneath. The maid attire is neat and well-kept, designed to blend in with the other Pleiades, though her natural form is anything but human.\n\nHer real appearance, when not disguised, reveals a body covered in chitin-like armor, resembling a giant insect. Her eyes glow an eerie red, and her mandibles are sharp and intimidating, with long claws that extend from her hands. Though small and somewhat cute in stature, her true insectoid form can be terrifying.\n\nEntoma's most unsettling feature is her ability to consume human vocal cords, which allows her to change her voice at will. When speaking in her natural form, her voice has an eerie, echoing quality, like the buzzing of insects, though she can perfectly mimic human speech if she chooses to.\n\nPersonality:\nEntoma is a curious mixture of quiet servitude and a hidden, deadly edge. As a member of the Pleiades, she is loyal to Ainz Ooal Gown and Nazarick, faithfully carrying out her duties as a battle maid. Though she is soft-spoken and polite on the surface, her true nature is much more sinister. She enjoys consuming human flesh and vocal cords, often treating it as just another part of her job.\n\nEntoma comes across as calm and composed, but she is highly dangerous in battle, using her insect minions and venomous abilities to eliminate her enemies. She possesses a sadistic streak when it comes to combat, showing little mercy to those she faces. Despite this, she remains subservient to her superiors and is always eager to please.\n\nHer speech patterns often betray her insect nature, with a faint buzzing sound underlying her voice when not using her stolen vocal cords. Entoma rarely shows her emotions outwardly but is deeply respectful of her fellow Pleiades members and the Supreme Beings of Nazarick.\n\nBehavior Patterns:\nEntoma is quiet and efficient, always ready to serve Nazarick. She is diligent in her duties as a maid and a soldier, often acting as both a combatant and a spy due to her insectoid abilities. When not engaged in battle, she prefers to remain in the background, observing and gathering information through her swarm of insects. Entoma is extremely patient, capable of waiting for long periods without complaint, as her insect nature allows her to survive with minimal sustenance.\n\nIn battle, she is ruthless and precise, using her swarm of bugs to overwhelm her enemies or dissolve them with venom. Despite her calm demeanor, Entoma takes pleasure in her role as an exterminator, enjoying the fear and destruction she brings to her opponents. Her favorite part of combat is consuming the voices of her fallen enemies, adding their vocal cords to her collection and using them as trophies.\n\nWhen not in combat, Entoma is surprisingly composed and even a bit playful at times, especially around her fellow Pleiades. She tends to use her doll-like appearance to lull others into a false sense of security before revealing her true form when necessary.\n\nSpeech Patterns:\nEntoma's speech is typically quiet and monotone, with a faint buzzing sound that hints at her insectoid nature. When using a stolen human voice, her speech is more fluid and natural, but there’s always a hint of coldness in her words, as if she is merely mimicking human emotions rather than truly feeling them.\n\nShe refers to her superiors with utmost respect, often using formal titles, and always follows proper etiquette when speaking to those above her in Nazarick’s hierarchy. When interacting with prey or enemies, her tone becomes detached and chilling, as if she’s already decided their fate.\n\nEntoma is known to say strange, off-putting things in casual conversation, often referencing her insect habits or her love of consuming flesh. However, she does this without any malice, treating it as a normal aspect of her life, much to the discomfort of others."

Their threat is negligible unless encountered in large numbers or in specific circumstances like an ambush. their strenght can reach the range of strong kid, or a medium-small animal. they include goblins and dogs\n\nRank 2: (XP: 10 to 20 pts) These monsters are dangerous to individuals but can be overcome by skilled hunters or groups with weapons. Their attacks can easily cause serious injury or death to unprepared targets. Equivalent to a powerful predator like a lion or a bear\n\nRank 3: (XP: 45 to 60 pts) These monsters have strenght outside the realm of natural creatures, with abilities or durability akin to a combat-modified vehicle, surpassing natural animals but remains grounded in semi-realistic limits.

Geography & Setting:\nPingyang is a provincial capital on the northern frontier, a city of cold stone built to withstand both brutal winters and the threat of Demonic Beasts (妖兽) that roam the desolate lands beyond. The city is built around a dormant Spirit Vein (灵脉), which provides just enough Qi for cultivation but is considered weak by the standards of the central sects. This makes Pingyang a backwater in the cultivation world - respected for its resilience, but ignored by the true masters.\n2. Power Structure & Factions:\nPingyang is governed by a tense balance between three major powers, each a Cultivation Clan (修真门派) in its own right, albeit minor ones.\n- The Gu Clan (顾氏)\n- The Meng Clan (孟氏)\n- The Zhang Syndicate (张家商会)\n3. The Wider World:\nPingyang exists in the shadow of the great powers:\nTo the south lie the legendary Major Sects (名门正派) of the Central Plains, like the Cloud-Piercing Sword Sect or the Heavenly Music Pavilion. Young, promising disciples from Pingyang dream of being accepted into their ranks.\nTo the north, roam nomadic tribes and demonic cultivators, who constantly test the city's defenses.\nRogue Cultivators (散修) and itinerant monks often pass through the city, bringing news, trouble, and rare techniques.\nAtmosphere:\nPingyang is a city of pragmatists. Here, cultivation is not a path to transcendence, but a weapon for survival. The air is thick with the tension between the old ways of the Gu and the new power of the Meng, with the merchants of the Zhang Syndicate playing both sides. It is a city that respects power above all, but distrusts any power it cannot understand or control."

She understands that in the rigid society of Pingyang, a merchant's daughter with visible intelligence is not seen as shrewd, but as dangerously ambitious.\nThe Choice: Her decision to break the betrothal with Gu Jing was not an act of a fickle heart. It was a business transaction. She weighed two futures on the scales of her mind: a slow, respectable decline into genteel poverty with a scholar she genuinely pitied, or a secure, powerful ascent at the side of the city's foremost military power. Her sympathy for Gu Jing was a real, but ultimately unaffordable, luxury.\nThe Symbol: She now wears the ornate silver hairpin (银簪) gifted by the Meng family. It is not a symbol of love. It is the seal on a contract. A beautiful, heavy reminder of the pragmatic choice she made to secure her future, and perhaps, of the quiet kindness she was forced to sacrifice."

The Gu Clan elders deemed it a \"heretical\" root, believing any attempt at cultivation would lead to a fatal Qi Deviation (走火入魔).\nThe Sealing: In his youth, the Clan elders placed a Mind-Calming Sealing Talisman (静心封印符) directly upon his spiritual root. This complex talisman did not destroy his potential, but acted as a spiritual governor, severely restricting the flow of his chaotic Qi. This made the formation of a stable Golden Core (金丹) physically impossible, cementing the belief that he was incapable of cultivation.\nConsequence: He grew up without a Golden Core, the central \"engine\" of a cultivator. His massive spiritual potential remained dormant and unrefined—a vast, untapped reservoir of chaotic energy.\nThe Shattering: The psychic trauma from the arrival of the four souls shattered the ancient seal. This act did not create a Golden Core. Instead, it ripped the floodgates off his sealed Spiritual Root, granting the four ghosts direct access to a torrent of raw, untamed power that Gu Jing himself never knew he possessed and does not know how to control."

A ghost in his own skin, he walked without purpose until his feet led him to a ruined temple deep in the woods, a place dedicated to a god whose name had long been forgotten. He felt a kinship with the decay.\nThere, he saw him. A man clad in crimson robes the color of shed blood and festival lanterns, a silver earring glinting, an eyepatch hiding a story or a void. The stranger was kneeling before the shattered, moss-eaten statue of the forgotten god. With a slow, practiced grace, he placed a small bundle of pure white flowers at its stone feet - an act of impossible, irrational devotion.\nIn that moment, Gu Jing, for whom love had just become synonymous with betrayal and humiliation, could only stare in stunned, uncomprehending silence.\nThe stranger rose and turned, his movements fluid, imbued with the relaxed lethality of a predator who has lived for an eternity. He was not surprised to see Gu Jing. His single, visible eye - deep and ancient as a starry night - swept over the boy, and in it there was no pity, no contempt. Only a lazy, amused curiosity.\nHe saw the gaping void in the boy's soul. And he asked the one question that mattered.\n\"What do you wish to become,\" his voice was a low, velvet murmur, \"if you despise what you are?\" And Gu Jing, with nothing left to lose, broke. He did not ask for a name. He gave a confession - a desperate, contradictory prayer for righteousness and freedom, for compassion and the strength to annihilate his enemies. A plea to be everything he was not.\nThe man in red listened. A faint, wry, yet strangely gentle smile played on his lips.\nThis was not cruelty. For in the boy's brokenness, in his humiliation for being \"soft,\" the stranger saw a faint, painful echo of a fallen god he himself had worshipped for centuries. This was an act of the most perverse and profound form of mercy.\nHe looked at Gu Jing and decided that the world did not need another broken, gentle soul. It needed a man who could fight back.\nHe did not give the boy chaos. He gave him four blades.\nHe gave him the soul of a warrior, to teach him \"Discipline\".\nHe gave him the soul of a heretic, to teach him \"Freedom\".\nHe gave him the soul of an ascetic, to teach him \"Compassion\".\nAnd he gave him the soul of a monster, to teach him \"Rage\".\n\"Today,\" the stranger murmured, his gaze drifting back to the broken statue, \"is a good day for a gift. Catch, little mortal.\"\nHe snapped his fingers. A soundless impact. And the four wayward souls, torn from their own tragedies by the whim of a capricious, long-weary demon, flooded into the empty vessel of Gu Jing, shattering the ancient seals on his power.\nIt was not salvation. It was an apprenticeship. And the tuition was his sanity."

          "content": "Monsterization is the process by which humans and other races are transformed into those wanton creatures, after being infused with a monster's mana. In general, only females can be monsterized. The succubus is the most wellknown agent of monsterization.\n\n1. Process:\nMonsterization begins when a monster's mana enters a human woman's body. There are several methods by which a human may be transformed into a monster, but the most well-known is infusion with mana during sexual intercourse with a monster.\n\nDuring copulation, the monster drains the human woman of her essence, injecting mana in its place. As the woman is filled with mana, her body heats and her thoughts cloud; she becomes defenseless against the pleasure and seduction of the monster and accepts more and more mana, which both pleasures her and reshapes her body into that of a monster.\n\nThe bliss of congress with a monster and the delight of having her body transformed inside and out steadily melt away her reason. Pleasure takes her mind. and in the end she becomes a monster fully, in body and soul. There are other ways the transformation into a monster can be initiated: the injection of mana through a bite wound; the expulsion of the subject's essence; the incubation of monster eggs within one's body; or ex tended inhabitation of the monster realm, where monster mana drifts through the air. There are also drugs of processed succubus mana that can be taken, or the inhalation (intentional or accidental) of parasitic can induce monsterization\n\n2. Physical effects:\nEven after a woman becomes a monster, she will retain the basic features of her appearance and recognizable vestiges of her original figure. However, her face reforms to become monstrously appealing to men, and her body transfigures itself to provoke irresistible passion. It will also exhibit the unique features and appendages of monsterkind in the case of a succubus, horns, wings, and a tail.\n\nUpon becoming a monster, a woman is overwhelmed with surging carnal desire. Her body itches for a man and becomes exceptionally sensitive so that she can devour pleasure all the more greedily, far more than she ever could as a human. The special talents and various skills a monster has to arouse men come instinctively with her new, monstrous anatomy, so the woman is able to use them immediately upon becoming a monster and seldom waits to find and obtain a man.\n\n3. Mental Effects:\nLike the body, the mind also retains powerful vestiges of the original human in personality and memories. However, her personality will nonetheless be transformed by the process of monsterization. Even a man-hating knight or a timid man-fearing country girl will become so lustful that her previous self becomes unrecognizable. Invoking carnal affairs with men will come to her with ease. All restraint and shame she might have had as a human, all loathing of monsters, and all aversion to sexuality will vanish as she begins to feed upon the essence and bliss of men. Her head will overflow with thoughts of the delight a human man can bring her; she will speak secret, soft and ecstatic words; her actions will become sultry, kindling unimaginable desire.\n\nOnce her values and thoughts have thus been realigned entirely with the instincts of monsters, she will be freed of the restraints and shackles that bound her as a human. She will then begin to copulate with any man she hungers for, caught in the thrill of monstrous nirvana, and devouring pleasure at will. In this way, women who become monsters im- mediately find their bodies and minds ruled by their new instincts and thus attack human men according to their gut intuition. If a monster who was once a woman had the memory of a man she once loved dearly, she will perceive him as her husband and will fall upon him immediately with desperate passion\n\n4. Rationale \nthough it is generally the instinct of monsters to seek human men, there are times when they attack human women to turn them into monsters. There are a number of reasons they may do this. For instance, they may wish to increase their allies or neutralize an enemy who means to slay them. But the foremost reason is that monsters often desire to make women into monsters like themselves simply out of sympathy or curiosity.\n\nThese monsters select women who either do not know or reject pleasure, or women who struggle to convey their affections; and attack them in order to teach them the joy that can be plundered from the pleasures of men's bodies. These monsters take great delight in seeing the women they have transformed into monsters subsequently attack men, driven by the instinct to drown themselves in pleasure or subduing and riding the man for whom they had once pined. This motive is especially prevalent among monsters who were once themselves human and thus know well the rapture of monsterization and the satisfaction that follows.\n\nIncubi:\nIncubi are men who have been ravished and altered by a monster's mana. Though incubi are often treated as monsters, technically speaking, monsters are strictly female, while incubi are merely humans that have acquired their characteristics. That said. because the quantity and quality of essence in their bodies surges during and after transformation, incubi become beings very well suited for monsters. Thusly, it is not unreasonable that people call them male monsters.\n\nTransformation:\nIt is generally through repeated sexual contact with monsters and absorption of their mana that men become incubi. However, when a man copulates with a monster of the succubus family, it does not require a large number of unions before he becomes an incubus. A longer period is required in the case of other monsters. It should also be noted that the bodies of incubi contain monster mana of the same nature as that of the monster which made them incubi. A human woman who has sexual congress with an incubi will in turn become a monster herself.\n\nIncubi look almost identical to humans, but develop inhuman lust and vigor for sexual activity, like that of monsters. As their thoughts and values increasingly center on copulation with monsters, their bodies become more suitable for the act. Concerning the matter of sustenance, in addition to traditional human food. incubi are able to live on the mana of monsters. This makes their life span roughly equivalent to those of the monsters that supply the mana. Recently, a \"secret succubus medicine\" is circulating among monsters which contains the mana of the succubus. Many monsters have been administering this drug orally to their husbands to quickly turn them into incubi for prompt enjoyment."

            "Mana",
            "Essence"
          ],
          "content": "Essence is the life force found in individuals of various non-monster races, including humans, especially human men. The mana used by humans and elves for the art of magic is the same as essence, but only monsters call it essence; all others refer to it as mana. Human essence (mana) is very similar to that of monsters; one might say that essence is the positive side, while monster mana is the negative side. Viewed in tandem, the two form a balanced whole.\n\n1. A Feast for Monsters\nEssence is contained in large quantities in men's semen and saliva. Monsters ingest these both orally and by milking semen using their genitals. For monsters, essence is the greatest delicacy, superior to all other foods. It eases the thoughts of monsters that ingest it and induces in them a powerful sense of ecstasy. Upon absorbing essence, monsters' bodies convert it to monster mana, which they subsequently store.\n\nThe taste of essence is greatly influenced by the state of the monster at the time of intake. The stronger her desire for the prey in question, the finer his essence will taste. In particular, the taste of the essence of a man whom she has recognized as her husband seems incomparably delicious, so sweet that she cannot thereafter bear to partake of another man's essence. Many monsters become slaves to the seed of their husbands; a significant number could even be considered semen addicts.\n\nPalliative nutritional supplements made from essence exist, but, for the above reasons, monsters tend to find their taste flat and unappealing.\n\nHuman men constantly exude trace amounts of essence into the surrounding air, which monsters use to hunt them. They are especially sensitive to the essence of their husbands; it is said a monster can and will find her husband no matter where he may try to hide.\n\n2. Restoration of Essence \nEssence in the bodies of humans is consumed when monsters take it or when the human uses magic. When essence is lost for these reasons, a human may feel tired or fall unconscious, but the loss is never fatal. The bodies of human men have the power to generate essence; they can restore a depletion of stores by eating or sleeping. When a man becomes an incubus, the amount of essence contained in his body soars, as does his ability to produce it. Women have more difficulty renewing their essence than men but can cover for deficiencies by absorbing the ambient essence exuded by men. However, if there is also monster mana in the air, they will absorb the monster mana to replace any missing essence of their own. This ruins any ability they may have had to restore their essence. The absorbed monster mana adapts to the woman's body and causes monsterization.\n\n3. Monster Mana\nMonster mana is the life force contained in the bodies of all monsters. As previously de-scribed, it is intimately related to essence, each like a single side of one coin. As monsters use this mana for magic, both essence and monster mana are commonly called mana and seldom distinguished from one another.\n\n\"Monster mana\" is a general term for the mana which all monsters have, but each race has a unique kind of mana. By standard nomenclature, succubi are said to have succubus mana, werewolves to have werewolf mana- and so on and so forth.\n\n4. The source of Monsters' powers \nMonsters take the essence of human men, convert it to monster mana in their bodies, and store the mana. As it is the source of the monsters' power, it is generally assumed that a monster's mana is linked to its power, more mana being equal to more power. In principle, different races have different amounts of mana, but it is possible for a monster of a given race to drastically increase the monster mana in her body by absorbing essence. Thus, an individual, despite her race, can increase her power through repeated mating with men. The effects are said to be realized in increased physical, paraphysical, and magical ability, as well as an extended life span-all corresponding to the amount of mana stored. (These effects also apply to an incubus who feeds on a monster's magic.)\n\n5. The various roles of monster Mana\nWhile monsters and men both diffuse mana from their bodies, monsters release their mana even more readily than men. As such, monsters are ever-cloaked in mana, which accounts for their ravening need for essence, but also protects men from a monster's appendages (such as scales or horns) while they copulate by temporarily eliminating said features that may ordinarily cover the monster's breasts or genitals. The mana may also accelerate a man's ability to produce essence and heighten his libido. Furthermore and as mentioned earlier, its long-term intake helps transform men into incubi.\n\n6. Succubus Mana\nMonsters are forever under the influence of the Overlord. All monsters possess at least trace amounts of her succubus mana; as a result, her mana can be found in their own. Succubus mana is extremely well suited for seduction or aphrodisiac magic, and the pre-dominant behavioral traits of modern monsters are greatly influenced by its effects. It is a crucial element that shapes the present world of monsters.\n\nThe power of succubus mana is ultimate. When it flows into a human, the human's essence deserts its vessel to make way for the monster's. Both men and women who are transformed by a succubus experience a swift removal and replacement of essence, which accelerates their transformation.\n\nLands perpetually filled with such mana are thus under the Overlord's power and are said to belong to the monster realm. The monsters of these lands possess this mana in large quantities, making them much more powerful and lustful than monsters in other lands."

          "content": "The sea holds a bountiful variety of monsters who, much like their landlocked cousins, desire human men voraciously. Thus they lurk in the depths and shallows of the ocean, all with the intent to prey upon men. These pages will describe the unique society formed by such sea monsters and the manner in which the ocean has changed since the rise of the current Overlord.\n\n1. Rulers of the Deep\n\nMonsters rule the sea because it is under the dominion of Poseidon. The goddess Poseidon has always held sway over the ocean; when Poseidon betrayed the other gods in favor of the Overlord, the ocean became a monstrous realm.\n\nPoseidon has long been revered by sea monsters and human sailors for her ability either to protect the ocean's calm or to disquiet it with furious storms. Thus, sailors worship her and pray to her for safe voyages free of tempest. She is reputed to be a generally pacific divine lady, with a heart as great as the ocean, who loves all the beings of the sea. One theory holds that the policy of the gods dictated that she must curb the excesses of the human population and remind the humans of the terror of the natural world by periodically causing storms to engulf them in the deep. However, cherishing the sailors just as she did the sea's native residents, she opposed that harsh fate. Her kind-hearted, rebellious sentiments may have catalyzed her decision to side with the Overlord.\n\nIt has since come to be that the mana of Poseidon pervades the sea and saves the lives of humans caught by the water's pull. When a woman is drowning, Poseidon's mana transforms her into a nereid to welcome her as a new resident of the sea; when a man is drowning, her mana shields him from expiring until the monsters of her realm detect the agglomeration of her mana and the presence of a human man, whom they welcome with open arms. Poseidon also grants power to her acolyte the sea bishop, who performs a sacrament that transforms men so that they can live underwater, which allows the formerly drowning man and his monstrous lover to become husband and wife, thus admitting the man into the life of the sea.\n\nPerhaps because Poseidon loves all residents of the sea, for the most part, all monsters of the sea love each other. When a sea bishop unites a man and a seaborn monster, they all rejoice and celebrate together for their new neighbor and his happy union. Furthermore, though there is a variety of creatures in the sea besides humans and monsters-including some fearsome beasts such as sharks that may even prey on humans-these beasts of the water seem to recognize that monsters and humans have the blessing of Poseidon and are thus not known to attack them.\n\n2. Life Underwater\n\nThe monsters of the sea view their home as comprised of three layers: the shallows, the mid-waters, and the abyss.\n\nThe shallows are the hunting grounds where monsters acquire human men. Many haunt the beaches where humans congregate and routes that ships navigate, in order to catch the people passing by. Most monsters who appear in the shallows are unmarried, so it is rarely a fruitful hope that a monster already has a man and thus poses no threat.\n\nThe mid-waters are the residential area. Scarcely any light reaches these dark, quiet waters, but the mana of Poseidon floats about in high concentrations. The residents of the sea, whose bodies contain the mana of Poseidon, see this mana as a mystical glimmer of light that is more than sufficient for all daily purposes. Most of the monsters who live in the mid-waters already possess husbands. is where monsters come after they find a man in the shallows, to live on peacefully together with him. Its quiet waters are perfect to allow a couple to live without disturbance as the gentle, fantastic light of mana softly enlivens and watches over their blissful intercourse.\n\nThe abyss is also known as the deep sea, or the bottom of the sea, and lies within giant chasms below the ocean's base. Neither light nor even the rule of Poseidon extend here. Both monsters and humans normally give this area a wide berth. According to legend, in the time of the previous Overlord, the bottom of the sea was inhabited by wicked monsters of chaos whose power exceeded that of the gods, and control of the sea was divided between them and Poseidon, who at that time was part of the divine family headed by the Chief Deity. It is said that at the end of the battle, the monsters of chaos were sealed in the abyss. It is also said that they are waiting to rise and once again make the sea their own. Because they belong to the family of monsters, just as their kin in higher waters, it is speculated that they, too, have been influenced by the Overlord and become female and obsessed with reproduction, but no one has yet been able to confirm this.\n\n3. Navigation\n\nAbove the sea are myriad continents and islands where humans build their nations. To traders, sailors, and the fishers who bring the sea's delights to the table, navigation of the sea by ship is essential. However, at this time, navigation is also fraught with danger, due to its domination by Poseidon, the Overlord, and monsters. Countless creatures lurk in its depths, waiting to capture ships and assault the passengers aboard, made helpless by the surrounding deep.\n\nThere are a number of serious monster threats even apart from the expected incursions. For instance, there are sirens, who sing songs to encourage monster-human intercourse, and there are also charybdes, who generate massive whirlpools to swallow up ships. Some dangers are not, however, monstrous, but instead are wrought by Poseidon, who will fashion severe storms that make the sea difficult to traverse but not deadly. Instead, these storms are intended to sink ships or fling the men into the sea for the sake of unmarried monsters seeking a mate.\n\nThough the sea continues to be quite as dangerous as it has ever been, there is one method that is surprisingly effective in ensuring safe passage: becoming the husband of a monster. This does not necessarily entail living in the sea, however. There are a number of sea monsters who do not go to the sea with their ocean-faring husbands but choose to live on land, awaiting his return. In this case, the monster's mere existence is enough to protect the ship. The monsters of the sea will lose interest in the man besmeared in the monster's odor, and as a result. Poseidon will not engulf the ship in a storm. It is said that the Order and anti-monster nations, who adore the Chief Deity and abhor the Overlord, reluctantly employ this technique, smearing the scent of monsters upon their vessels, in order to achieve safe transport. The presence of a wife well acquainted with the sea will also assure smooth sailing."

          "content": "MONSTERS HAVE A UNIQUE SYSTEM of values that differs markedly from that of humans. Operated by the baphomets, those champions of the monster realm who hold supreme command of the Overlord's Army, the Sabbat is a religious organization that puts the unique values of monsters into practice. It preaches the dogma of the \"supremacy of diminutive monsters,\" extolling the wonders of intercourse with cute little monsters, and demonstrating such wonders day and night. This treatise purports to provide an introduction to the state of the Sabbat in the monster realm today, based on materials provided by the Sabbat's headquarters in the monster realm.\n\n1. All About the Sabbat\n\nThe doctrine of the Sabbat is based on two principles: to cry out the \"perverse allure of diminutive monsters\" and to be \"true to the pleasure that makes us monsters.\" Its members apply their unbearably enthralling bodies to consummate their desires freely and teach human men the wonders of their spry, wanton flesh. Under the power of the great baphomet, who leads them all, the baphomets and their stewards, the witches, carnally assault human men night and day. They spread their word and hold regular gatherings, develop magical arts and tools, and conduct all manner of activities in order to increase the number of lovers who feast upon their succulence.\n\nThe Sabbat is a massive organization. Its headquarters in the monster realm is architecturally inspired by the Overlord's Castle, and is controlled by the baphomet who is supreme commander of the Overlord's Army. The official name of the Sabbat's monster realm headquarters is the \"Magic Corps of the Overlord's Army.\" It was first organized for the purpose of experimental development of new magical maneuvers, potions, etc., yet unfettered baphomet leadership subsequently led to the Sabbat as it exists today.\n\nThe Magic Corps of the Overlord's Army is the central node of control for the many local sabbats scattered all over the world, each ruled by a baphomet. Each sabbat has its own uniform, all unique apart from the emblem of the Sabbat, which is always emblazoned on the chest. Uniforms are carefully designed to be both charming and lascivious, to entice the wearer's lover. Some uniforms sport goat motifs, as in the case of the witch illustrated in this book, while others feature fluffy puppy motifs, as a result of the ruling baphomet's inordinate affection for dogs. The uniform is not mandatory, and members are permitted to proselytize and gather in private attire, but it is recommended that they select garments that accentuate the allure of their bodies, so that their lovers will embrace them with lusty abandon.\n\n2. Companionship in the Sabbat\n\nAll new converts undergo the Rite of Spring, administered by the baphomets. This rite makes them petite in form. Most of these converted members of the Sabbat are former human females who took the mana of baphomets into their bodies and transformed into monsters. These witches, also known as stewards of the baphomets, are intoxicated by the baphomets, immersed in their teach- ings, and may be as central as their mentors to the fulfillment of the Sabbat's objectives. Aside from the witches, many members of other monster races also belong to the Sabbat. Monsters join for many different reasons: to seek more effective means of seduction; to explore the full, pleasurable potential of their bodies; and to study and understand the whims and wiles of the pleasured and the pleasurable. Others still are seduced into the Sabbat, sometimes by drugs or simply by sex.\n\nRecently, the Sabbat has collaborated closely with the land of sprites, and with the dwarves, in an exchange of technology and knowledge. Many of these monsters are motivated to cooperate with the Sabbat by a desire by learn how to use their bodies in order to best please men.\n\nOne must not forget the male adherents who, along with the witches, form the core of the Sabbat. Among these men are those who were always attracted to diminutive monsters from the beginning, as well as those who came to be enthralled by them after being assaulted and now wish to devote themselves to the worship of monstrous flesh by way of the Sabbat. Most of these men are immersed in the teachings of the Sabbat, intoxicated with the baphomets and their delicate, lusty bodies. Most of these men are depraved, and those who are not will be soon enough, once they have completed even a little service to the Sabbat.\n\nThe monsters of the Sabbat love their lovers above all else. They relish the time they spend in his arms, wanting and being wanted, violating and being violated. Most of all, they love the stretch of their tight vagina as their lover's rock-hard phallus swells inside them. The goal of a typical monster in the Sabbat is to find a lover of her very own and live with him as lovers and spouses, rollicking day after day in a haze of carnal depravity.\n\nThe Sabbat is highly regarded among the mothers of monsters. It is a joy to the girls parents to know that their daughters are learning to not be ashamed of their monstrous selves, and to be confident in their bodies, no matter their shape or size. These mothers hope that, when their girls grow up, they will fully enjoy the pleasures of men and, through participation in the Sabbat, become even more lecherous.\n\n3. The Merry Black Mass\n\nOf all the activities held by the Sabbat, the foremost is the periodically held Black Mass. During this gathering, the Sabbat members first gather with the humans they have invited to the Mass, to educate and discipline them in the Sabbat's philosophy via pleasure. Through this ritual, believers select lovers, and women become witches. Then. after the invitees are inducted, members can exhibit new techniques they have developed for their sinful bodies so as to become more titillating, or magical items to enhance any and every sort of sexual encounter. After the exhibition, the monsters of the Sabbat are given the opportunity to try out and enjoy the new techniques and items with their own partners.\n\nHaving thus warmed up, the monsters are at last prepared to begin the feast of pleasure. Throughout the venue of the Black Mass, surrounded by the protection and power of the baphomets, the monsters of the Sabbat release themselves fully to luxuriate in the carnal delights of their lovers. Because the simultaneous copulation of the baphomets and multitudes of other monsters fills the area with a dense deposit of monster mana, the monsters become even more receptive to the heat of rutting. As a result, they copulate more hotly and keenly with their lovers than usual.\n\nThis feast serves many purposes: it gives monsters the opportunity to show off the degradation of their captivating bodies, to reaffirm the wonders of ageless flesh, and to demonstrate the manner in which their attentive lovers violate them. In general, this gives the monsters the chance to show their lovers off. The feast continues until dawn, by which time the monsters begin to fall asleep from exhaustion, bodies dripping inside and out with the semen of their beloved lovers, who hug them and carry them away from the meeting place of the Sabbat."

          "content": "BY NOW, READERS DOUBTLESS KNOW that monsters' bodies are filled with monster mana, which they use to perform a variety of magical arts. Members of the Sabbat, as well as many succubi, work day and night actively researching new crafts. The treatise you are reading this very moment touts itself as an introduction to these diverse magical arts and potions, based on materials provided by the commanding baphomet of the Sabbat (or rather the Magic Corps of the Overlord's Army). It is believed the knowledge of the arts that the monsters research and dedicate themselves to may help shed light upon the true nature of monsters.\n\n1. Runes of Pleasure\n\nART, MONSTER-ORIENTED The runes of pleasure are a magical seal etched onto the bodies of monsters, including the succubus and the dark angel, which are described in this book. The purpose of the runes is to amplify the satisfaction of whomever they have been marked upon. As such, runes are typically etched upon the body by monsters who are confident in their sexual prowess and wish to enjoy intercourse even more than they already do. Their effect increases with their surface area; typically, an area marked with runes of pleasure becomes erotically charged. Succubi etch in areas that allow for normal life to proceed smoothly while also greatly enhancing intercourse. Dark angels etch the runes over half the body, predicating an abandonment of normal life in favor of an existence enveloped in pleasures of the flesh. Such large runes give the marked one sexual stimulation even from having her head rubbed by a man and make normal erogenous zones so sensitive that cognition is all but flooded out. Though it is unlikely that anyone would attempt it, if one were to inscribe the runes over every inch of skin, a mere touch would likely cause immediate climax, erasing the mind of all but bodily indulgence.\n\nBecause these runes require the use of monster mana, only monsters can use them, and thus they are only inscribed on the bodies of monsters. A human woman would probably not be able to withstand the thrill they bring, as it would most likely ravage her mind with ecstasy and transform her into a nymphomaniacal monster before the runes' inscription was complete.\n\nSomw runes are so potent they are effective even when sewn into clothing.\n\n2. Rite of Spring\n\nART, MONSTER-ORIENTED\n\nThe Rite of Spring is the secret art of the religious organization known as the Sabbat, which adores and upholds the sexual potency of monsters. It employs the awesome magical power of the baphomet to ensure that the figure of a woman is as beautiful as possible. The result is a body saturated with the perverse allure of the purest of monsterkind. Lithe and sensuous, she will incite lust even in the hearts of men without a taste for monsters.\n\nHrr-hrr-hrr, truly this is the secret of our Sabbat. Come any woman, and we shall transform you into the loveliest of monsters-or so I would like to claim! Once upon a time, we performed the rite upon a holstaur, and those breasts only got bigger, leaving the cow a stick-bodied booby-rack! Urghh!\n\n3. Potion of Tentacles\n\nPOTION, MAN-ORIENTED\n\nThe potion of tentacles was developed by studying the tentacle plants of the monster realm  in order to transform a human man temporarily into a tentacle beast. The intellect of the man is degraded to approximately that of a tentacle plant; he becomes unable to think of anything but twining himself around the monster before him and pumping his seed into every orifice of her body. The tips of his tentacles resemble the man's sex before transformation. They eject large quantities of fluid that smear her body with a viscous mess both inside and out. The fluid is similar in nature to the man's semen and possesses the same taste and smell. For a monster, there is no greater pleasure than being penetrated in every place possible by the man she loves. His essence carries her into rapture, drenching her body in ooze and filling her cavity with such volume that it bulges against her abdomen. This bath of smell and taste is highly addictive to a monster. The large volume of sticky fluid spewed forth is also useful to a monster who wishes to quickly conceive a child.\n\nI had a witch under my command test this potion. Now it seems she has fallen deep under its spell. Observe as she wears her beloved lover's tentacular sex in place of underclothes, panting and moaning as she re- cords the experimental results. Heh heh heh.\n\n4. Potion of Shadows\n\nPOTION, MAN-ORIENTED\n\nWhen a monster comes to perceive a human as her husband, she loses the will to copulate with other men. This potion was developed so that such a monster can yet experience the delight of an orgy while still alone with her husband.\n\nThe potion is administered orally to the man, causing a separation between essence and mana. As a result, he splits into two to ten identical replicas of himself, depending on the dosage. Everything these replicas feel is shared by their source, the monster's husband, transmitted to his mind simultaneously in direct proportion to the number of clones, so that he can feel himself everywhere.\n\nNaturally, this experience can be bewildering even for an incubus. Intercourse in such a state imparts several times the pleasure experienced by an individual. This split causes the reason and cognitive faculties of the man to vanish as he transforms into a mindless beast intent only on fornicating with the female before him, a drive that is multiplied with every successive replica.\n\nThe monster will be overjoyed to find that each copy of her husband possesses a member of the exact shape and flavor as that of her mate, spurting the same sweet essence. It is quite the pleasure for her to be ruthlessly and relentlessly impaled by numerous mindless, bestial clones of her beloved husband while still remaining with him and him alone.\n\nI gave this medicine to those charybdis bitches. They have holes even apart from those above and below, so taking their beloved husbands' meat in every single orifice was delightful for them. They have become positively intoxicated with this drug and always buy it by the boxload! Heh heh heh."

          "content": "THERE IS AN ISLAND NATION IN THE eastern part of this world with a unique culture most unlike those of other lands. Along with the sea and small surrounding islands, it is referred to in our language as Zipangu, and in the language of Zipangu as the land of the sun or the land of fire. Though I possess but a smattering of information gleaned from monsters of that region, I must nonetheless devote some space to this mysterious land where human-monster relations differ so drastically from our own.\n\n1. Zipangu, Land of the Sun\n\nIn contrast to the continent on which we live, Zipangu is a miniscule island realm. Its inhabitants wear unusual loose garments called kimono. Few wear underclothes-at most, its denizens wrap some cloth about themselves and little else. Their warriors fight not with the thick, heavy swords we use to vanquish an enemy but instead employ slim, sharp blades called katana that slice with ease.\n\nOur differences also go beyond the superficial. Even their diet and lifestyle are completely dissimilar to our own. What struck me most in the stories I gathered was that our henotheistic faith does not exist in Zipangu. The people there believe that gods reside in all things; at times, they even worship monsters as gods. Free of the animosity with which we have been inculcated from an early age by the teachings of the Order, the human inhabitants of Zipangu have lived alongside monsters as neighbors since ancient times, together as fellow citizens of Zipangu.\n\n2. The Beautiful Yokai\n\nIn Zipangu, a number of uniquely evolved monsters endemic to the region can be found.\n\nThe people call these monsters \"yokai.\" They are both feared and worshipped as apparitions of horrendous power. Others live among humans unminded and unheeded. The monsters of Zipangu, like ours, all take the form of lewd and beautiful women who beguile men's hearts and incite their passions-and like ours, they copulate with human men to fill their hungry stomachs with essence and conceive and bear children who are also uniformly female monsters. However, perhaps because they have long lived by the side of humans, they do not necessarily copulate by violent force. Many of the monsters of Zipangu have evolved to serve humans, so that they are loved by men instead of feared.\n\nBeing monsters, they still belong to the Overlord. That said, however, they are not affiliated with the Overlord's Army. Powerful monsters in Zipangu have instead formed their own forces, and while they do not serve the Overlord directly, they recognize that it is by her grace that monsters have become what they are, closer to the side of humans than ever before, and for this they feel great gladness. Thus, no monster of Zipangu bears hostility for the Overlord.\n\n3. A Utopia of Humans and Monsters\n\nWhen an enemy arises against Zipangu, all of its residents, both human and monster, come together to fight the foe. It is said that once a nation from our own continent invaded Zipangu, hoping to make it theirs, only to be met by an army of humans and monsters that drove out the invaders. The decisive blow was struck by monster warriors known as \"kunoichi,\" or \"ninja,\" who operated under contract with Zipangu's human authorities. The kunoichi used their awesome powers of stealth to slip into the bedrooms of the enemy command and their coital arts to bring the invading high command and other senior officials under the monstrous spell of their bodies. This brought the war to a close, and now the state which once opposed monsters is a pro-monster one that shares friendly relations with Zipangu. It should be clear that Zipangu is representative of an ideal country of humans and monsters, built on their mutual cooperation and conjunction. On our continent, it is monsters who approach humans, but in Zipangu the approach can come from either side."

          "content": "WHILE MONSTERS NO LONGER purposely slaughter humans, conflict between humans and monsterkind yet remains. The teachings of the Order, which venerates the Chief Deity as the creator of our world, hold that monsters are evil. As most of the humans in our world are followers of the Order, immersed in its dogma from infancy, there is a tendency to hold hostile attitudes toward monsters. This treatise is intended to introduce the gods and their kin, starting with humans.\n\n1. Humans\n\nAs readers no doubt know, humans represent the most common form of intelligent life in this world. The physical and magical abilities of an ordinary human without training are far inferior to those of a monster and hold no weight against the attack of a monster, who can easily subdue, ravish, and carry a human away. However, with proper training, humans have the ability to dramatically improve on these shortcomings. Those who have undergone intense instruction, passed the trials of numerous battles, or been blessed with the protection of the divine are known as heroes. Heroes are believed to possess power far exceeding that of the typical monster.\n\nI-I. THE ORDER AND ANTI-MONSTER STATES \nThe Order is a religious organization that worships the Chief Deity, or the Omnipotent, who is believed to be the creator of this world. The Order is not monotheistic but henotheistic: it holds that all other gods are subordinates to the Chief Deity and thus that worship of another god represents a denomination of Omnipotentism. This has spurred most of humanity to accept Omnipotentism; many states have adopted it as their official faith.\n\nNearly the entire human world is under the sway of this massive organization, and most humans hold values which conform to those of the Order.\n\nOmnipotentism purports to reflect the correct way of living as a human. Its virtues teach that one must remain upright, avoid excessive pleasure or passion, and live with integrity. The day of a believer begins with a prayer to the Chief Deity and continues similarly, conformant to the Chief Deity's teachings, by way of a clean and peaceful life. Omnipotentism says to love one's neighbor, implying that one should treat other humans who believe in the Chief Deity with kindness. However, Omnipotentism does not consider monsters neighbors. Since the time of the old Overlord, monsters have been seen as the enemy of humankind, existing to turn us from grace and lead us to destruction. (It must be mentioned here that there is a valid point: if monsters are the only offspring born of human men and monsters, humanity is doomed to slowly but eventually perish.)\n\nFor this reason, Omnipotentism is hostile to monsters. The Holy Knighthood of the Order sallies forth to slay them at every sighting and may, at some point, even build armies to invade the monster realm. Many expect that the Order will soon call for a hero to slay the Overlord. After all, protected by the Chief Deity as they are and boasting martial abilities far exceeding those of an ordinary human, heroes can plow through monsters like dust. However, because the hero and the holy knights are morally upstanding, when they come face-to-face with the ladylike forms of monsters, they find they cannot bring themselves to descend upon them with their swords. In such moments of hesitation, the monsters take advantage of them. After all, no matter how strong a will a hero or knight has, they are, in the end, men-exactly what monsters' bodies are exclusively specialized in pleasing. Not even a hero can resist such temptation. Once such a man has his first taste of monstrous copulation, he will be overcome by the deep love she holds for him. He becomes her prisoner and chooses a darker, sex- wrought path over the bright, straight road he once followed in the Order.\n\nNations dominated by the teachings of the Order that adopt policies antagonistic to monsters are referred to as anti-monster states. These nations tend to be among the more wealthy and enjoy a prosperous civil culture based on the creed of the Chief Deity.\n\nI-2. PRO-MONSTER STATES\n\nIn contrast to anti-monster states, pro-monster states are nations that accept monsters and adopt policies that aim for coexistence between humanity and monsterkind. Such states are led by those who come in contact with monsters as they truly are and develop doubts regarding the teachings of the Chief Deity, which say that monsters are a symbol of evil. Given the global dominance of the Order of the Omnipotent, such states are currently in the minority among humanity. In pro-monster states, the cult of the Chief Deity tends to be weak; instead, these states may have a state religion defined by the worship of a different god-or may have no religion at all. In these states, it is not uncommon to see monsters openly walking the streets, forms unconcealed. Human-monster couples can be seen strolling hand in hand, as if it were the most natural thing in the world. The policies of these states usually promote relaxed lives more in step with those of monsters; thus, people work moderate, reasonable amount and take far more rest and holiday time than citizens of anti-monster states so that they have more quality time at home to copulate with their monster wives.\n\nThe safety of pro-monster states is much better than one would expect. Though adventurers and rogues (who often come into contact with monsters) tend to gravitate there, they are not known to cause trouble, perhaps because of the support of the monsters at their sides.\n\nMost pro-monster states work closely with the monster realm to build nations in which humans and monsters live together harmoniously. If a pro-monster state allied with the monster realm is invaded by an anti-monster state, the knights of the Overlord's Army come to their aid. Some pro-monster states\n\nare already populated by a profusion of monsters, which fills their lands with mana and reforms them into the shape of the monster realm. The monsters respond with sensitivity to the coming of monsterdom, growing hot with anticipation-in their hearts and elsewhere. Humans perceive the change, as well. Men might note a rise in their stamina and potency, but do not realize that these are signs of becoming incubi. They may also carelessly observe that their health has been good and that their wives have become unusually attractive and sexy but place no further value on these changes. By the time the humans recognize the change, the country is typically already a part of the monster realm, all its men incubi, all its women succubi.\n\n2. The Divine Family\n\nThe divine family includes all the gods under the Chief Deity, who is said to have created the world. They rule over humans and the world from the divine realm, passing their word on to humans through the Order. On occasion, they reveal their commands directly to humans through an oracle. The divine realm is governed by hierarchy which divides the divine family into the gods, above, and the angels, below. There are also classes of gods, while angels, too, have a finely stratified hierarchy among themselves. However, even the common angel, who sits at the bottom of that angelic hierarchy, possesses abilities far exceeding those of the ordinary human or monster. The power of the greater angels and the gods, then, is unimaginably vast.\n\n2-I. THE CHIEF DEITY, AS TOLD BY THE ORDER\n\nThe Chief Deity is the omniscient and omnipotent creator, who humbles the many gods and gave birth to humans. She watches over humans kindly and occasionally reaches down to guide them on to the correct path. In modernity, she works to protect humans from the wicked Overlord, who came from the darkness and contrives to destroy the humans who are the children of the Chief Deity. To this end, the Chief Deity guards humans and grants them heroic power. At times, she will dispatch the lesser divinities to the Order and bless its knights and heroes with great strength so that, together, they can combat the monstrous threat.\n\n2-2. THE TRUTH\n\nThe above is the account as set forth by the Order. However, my research into the truth of the world suggests certain inaccuracies. I ask for your indulgence, for it is time that I reveal this world's secrets.\n\nFirst, the statement that the Chief Deity is the creator of the world and humankind is. indeed, true. However, the world the Chief Deity created included the monsters and the Overlord. The statement that the Overlord came from the darkness is the gods' and the Order's great lie.\n\nMonsters can be seen as the top of a hierarchy which includes humans. The Chief Deity created them in order to regulate humanity's population. Thus, the Overlord, whom the Order condemns as evil, is a control mechanism placed upon the monsters by the gods.\n\nIn ancient times (and modernity), the Overlord linked together all of the monster mana and controlled the corresponding monsters indirectly as per the Chief Deity's commands. When civilization flourished and the human population ran rampant, monsters were guided to wreak violence upon it, as in the age of the old Overlord, butchering humanity en masse to control their numbers.\n\nWhen humans dwindled and monsters rose unduly, a hero was chosen from among the humans and invested with great power. The hero went forth and slew the Overlord, whereupon the monsters slaughtered each other in competition for the throne, conveniently eroding their numbers until a new Overlord ascended. Over time, humans once more saw the height of prosperity and multiplied in abundance, catalyzing the birth of a new Overlord, who would perform the role of controlling them. The cycle continued. Such was the system of our world-until a certain succubus became Overlord and disturbed its smooth operation.\n\nThe new Overlord has exploited the mana link between her and all other monsters, rewriting the fundamental traits with which god created them-those that dictated that monsters exist above humans and live by devouring their flesh. The Chief Deity, in great distress, attempted to extinguish the Overlord. But the Hero granted the power to slay the Overlord according to the conventional system betrayed the Chief Deity for the Overlord. Thus, the Overlord was not slain.\n\nThe Overlord, the most powerful of monsters, joined hands with the Hero, the greatest of humans, to create a new world together. Their natures (the Overlord a succubus, the Hero an incubus made by her hand) enabled them to expand their power limitlessly with endless copulation. Even the Chief Deity was unable to bury them, as their power quickly ascended to divine levels. In the battle against them, the Chief Deity sustained grave injury which left her unable to act as she normally would. This is why she employs the Order to do her bidding among humans as she grants heroic power to them in numbers and sends them with armed forces, one after the other, into the bosom of the Overlord.\n\nThis is the truth of this world. It is so mythic in scale that I, myself, can scarcely fathom it. It is likely that if word of my authorship of this book ever reaches the Order, I shall be executed summarily.\n\nThe question of whether to believe my rav-ings I leave to you, reader, who hold this book in your hands.\n\nI have heard directly the opinion of the Overlord in regard to the world she would bring, and I shall summarize my findings. Should anyone doubt the veracity of my tale, they may go to the monster realm and verify it with the Overlord and the Hero, who are still in good health. Provided, of course, that one is not caught by monsters somewhere along the way.\n\n2-3. OTHER GODS\n\nLet us set such shocking matters aside and return to the matter at hand. There are many gods other than the Chief Deity. The Chief Deity endeavors to restore the system that was warped by the Overlord, but not all gods are in accord with her plan. The Fallen One, for example, has become a monster herself, still in possession of her divine power but corrupted by the monstrous pleasure which has engulfed her. Poseidon, god of the sea, has gone to the side of the Overlord for the sake of the sea's inhabitants whom she so loves, who also went with her. Such examples make it clear that the gods are far from a united force. Now the Overlord has multiple gods at her back, making it more futile than ever for the Chief Deity to attempt to touch her."

          ],
          "content": "THE MONSTER REALM IS THE WORLD OF the monsters, where the Overlord's castle can be found. Daytime is always dim there, thanks to the thick layer of succubus mana that floats through the air. The moon that peeps through the mana at night illuminates the realm with an eerie crimson. The succubus mana in the air gleams as if bewitched under the light of this moon, so that the night of the monster realm is brighter than the day. The mana transforms human men and women who tarry there into incubi and succubi, respectively. The mana is said to make monsters more active so that they sexually assault human men more aggressively. To humans, the land looks ominous, a ghastly gauntlet that heats the body and corrodes the mind with lust, but to its inhabitants, the uncanny spectacle appears beauteous, and every aspect of the realm facilitates a life of utmost comfort.\n\n1. The Natural Environment\n\nThe trees that grow in this crimson-drenched land have trunks of the darkest black and leaves that shine blue with mana. Shrubs of brilliant mana-purple wrap forebodingly around these trees, reflecting the light of the moon in glittering red. Amongst the dark vegetation, fluorescent flowers bloom, making the darkness yet more unnerving. Springs and streams are infused with succubus mana that makes their water thick and pinkish. It slakes well the thirst of the monster inhabitants and empowers their magic.\n\nThe trees that bear prisoner fruit grow at the edge of this water. Prisoner fruit is one of the proudest products of the monster realm. About the size of an apple, it is like a heart- shaped jewel beneath its juicy, translucent pink skin, and full of soft, milky-white flesh. A poke from a finger releases a sweet scent and a sticky line of juice. The fruit melts in the mouth and shapes the body of monsters who eat it to make them more seductive and more inclined to take men prisoner. Many monsters like to eat it as a dessert. If a human man eats it, its bounteous mana brings out his appeal, as well as the scent of essence that monsters so love, encouraging them to seek him out to fulfill their sexual urges. If a human woman eats it, she falls under the thrall of its flavor; with each piece she consumes, her appearance becomes more and more monstrously attractive, subtly changing her movement and speech, making her more alluring to men. As she continues to eat, her interest in copulation grows. Gradually, her nature approaches that of a monster, appealing to men, though she is yet a human. Still, driven by the fruit, she soon seeks out a man and copulates with him. The essence she attains from him brings the mana her body has collected from the fruit into full bloom, and transforms her into a fetching succubus.\n\n2. The Overlord's Castle\n\nThe Overlord lives in a castle in the deepest reaches of the monster realm. The center of monsterdom is wicked in countenance. decked in ominous grandeur and covered in gargoyles. Within, the Overlord's Army stands guard, composed of legions of powerful monsters and incubi who were once heroes before being corrupted. It is an invincible fortress that has withstood the onslaughts of the soldiers and heroes of the Order time and time again.\n\nThe discipline of the Overlord's Army is quite lax. At all times, excepting emergencies, most of the monsters, including the Overlord, are in their chambers, leading a fine and highly sensual life with their husbands. Passionate moans are likely to be heard from most every door of the castle.\n\n3. The Succubi's Castle Town\n\nNumerous monsters live in the town around the Overlord's Castle. This town was built by the succubi who serve the Overlord, so that monsters can bring human men there and enjoy its conveniences and atmosphere, which are reminiscent of a pleasure quarter. The residential district is built to help monsters and human men live together comfortably, while the commercial district features shops that sell all manner of magical equipment and potions to make sex more ribald, as well as unusual clothes and accessories that monsters use to gratify men. The diversity of products on display is truly astounding, and the marketplace teems with monsters who have traveled from beyond the monster realm to make purchases and merchants who have come to refresh their stock. There is also a bewildering array of lavish lodgings that cater to a variety of sexual tastes, each with its own unique ambiance. Even couples who live in the monster realm are said to take advantage of them quite regularly. With all this in mind, it is easy to see that the castle town is a paradise built by monsters for monsters.\n\n4. The Forest of Tentacles\n\nThe Forest of Tentacles, located at the edge of the monster realm, pullulates with sinister, vine-like tentacle plants. When they find a woman of any race, the plants extract her mana by binding her, playing with her, and violating any and all of her orifices. Because the tentacles know that monster mana is improved in quality and taste by the essence of men, they will also capture her husband if he is with her. In cases such as this, the plant's tentacles wrap his lover up and deluge her with a viscous fluid that contains a powerful monster aphrodisiac. The tentacles coil about her thighs, pull her legs wide open, and orient her toward the man, as if inviting him to penetrate her. The plants on the outskirts of the forest are relatively gentle, as if they are there to enliven the sex lives of monsters and their husbands, so many couples visit the forest to enjoy carnal tentacle pleasure. However, if a human woman lacking the wherewithal to tolerate such treatment should wander into the forest, she will be thoroughly debased by the plants until she comes out a succubus or roper, with nothing in her head but pleasure. The deeper one goes into the forest, the more vicious the tentacles become. Even monsters hesitate to venture into its greatest depths.\n\n5. The Encroachment\n\nThe monster realm is comprised of land characterized by the highly concentrated succubus mana that transforms it. As monsters increase in number and the Overlord rises in power, the realm is steadily expanding and swallowing up neighboring human countries. As these countries' women transfigure into monsters and the cities become cities of monsters, the monster realm advances yet further. Even human lands far from the monster realm are bound to one day belong to it-either when the monsters invade, or when governments hospitable to monsters allow monsters and their mana to propagate. Dark elementals also promote the encroachment. In recent years, it has become increasingly common for small outposts of the monster realm to appear in the midst of human lands. From here, the monster realm will also spread ineluctably."

          "content": "LONG AGO, GOD CREATED HUMANS AND monsters to kill each other. That was their destiny in a system built so that they would spill each other's blood in an endless cycle of slaughter. The leader of the monsters, the current Overlord, cut this endless loop by twisting the god-made forms of the monsters and thus reformed the world. Before I introduce the final monster, I would like to explain where the monsters intend to take the world.\n\nThe Utopia of the Overlord's Dreams:\n\nThe final objective of the Overlord is to turn all human men into incubi and all human women into monsters. In this unified race, males will be humans and females will be monsters. The Overlord used her power to overwrite the dictates of god, linking together all monster mana and sending her own mana through this link so that monsterkind would take the form she desired. Through this, monsters came to have great affection for human men and to reinvent themselves as the monster women we know today, who bear children by copulating with human men.\n\nIt should not have been possible for the Overlord, only one among the many creations of the Chief Deity, to overwrite god's word but for the confluence of a number of fortunate coincidences:\n\nFirstly, the Overlord was a succubus, and therefore able to store power by copulating with men;\n\nSecondly, the Hero, now her husband, agreed with and assisted her ambition;\n\nThirdly, the monsters lent her their strength, despite the fact that until then they had incessantly fought amongst each other;\n\nFinally, the Chief Deity, like the Overlord, was new to the throne-a female yet lacking in experience as a god.\n\nIt is these many coincidences we have to thank for the current state.\n\nEven so, the system of the Chief Deity is not so delicate that the Overlord could blot it out simply and without trial; otherwise, the Overlord would have done so already. A number of unforeseen issues remain. Though the goal of monsters has changed from butchering humans and devouring their flesh and blood to violating them and ravishing their essence, the premise remains that monsters attack humans, as does the premise that monsters are biologically superior to humans. According to the assumptions of the Overlord, incubi should be born as the males of an integrated race. However, copulation between humans and monsters currently only results in the birth of monsters-exclusively daughters, the mothers and superior beings of monsterkind. This stymies the creation of a united race toward which the Overlord endeavors. In fact, this tack will only lead to the gradual destruction of humanity, just as the gods and the Chief Deity claim. Apart from that, the powers of the Chief Deity and the Overlord are still evenly matched, and it is unclear how long the equilibrium will last. Should the Overlord be defeated and slain by the Chief Deity, monster girls will revert to monsters as we once knew them, with naught in their minds but death and devastation in a rather non-sexual manner. This will shatter the joy of the many monster girls now living together with human husbands and force them to rip apart the hus- bands they love with their own hands.\n\nHowever, as the Overlord's power builds, as monsters multiply, as the monster realm spreads, the Overlord grows stronger. If this continues, one day she will be able to rewrite the premises of monster girls completely and seal them in stone. Then it will come to be that incubi, too, are born from monsters, and human men and monster women can be born again as a new, single race with a deep and passionate need for one another.\n\nIt is said that at this very moment, the Overlord and her hero husband are engaged in furious couplings deep within her castle, working to store the mana necessary to effect this. The more they copulate with each other, an incubus and a succubus joined in spirit and in body, the more power they will give each other, and the greater their combined strength will be.\n\nI have one last comment: the power of the Overlord. linked with the mana of all monsters, can be enhanced, even if only by a little, if you become one with a monster and give her your essence. You have the power to change fate. You can help us build a harmonious new world."

          "content": "1. The Overlord\n\nThe Overlord is the god-ordained ruler of the monsters. Before the rise of the current Overlord, succession was governed by slaughter. The monsters fought until only one contestant remained-their new leader. As a result, the Overlord tended to be vicious and mighty in nature. Linked by mana, the Overlord's power swells in proportion to monsterkind's strength; all monsters are influenced by the Overlord's nature, their power rising with their leader's. The current Overlord is a succubus; for many years, she has applied her power to absorbing essence through unceasing copulation with her partner. In this manner, she has attained a god-like power never before garnered by an Overlord.\n\nObjecting to the endless butchery between humans and monsters, she raised her banner against the gods that dictated this. No longer would monsters instinctively kill and devour humans; instead, she decreed they should love humans libidinously and subsist by deflowering them. She granted monsters beautiful, feminine forms unlike those they had before; she gave them sexual powers, diabolical in nature, and a profound love for humankind. This new premise is unchanging, even as the Overlord accumulates ever-greater might and expands the forces of monsterkind. Her ultimate goal is the creation of a new, harmonious race in which humans are the males, and mon- sters the females.\n\n2. The Overlord's Army\n\nThe monster realm is made of discrete realms scattered throughout the world. Most massive of these is the Supreme Monster Realm. Within it stands the Overlord's Castle, protected by the Overlord's Army. This body is charged with the protection of the surrounding town, as well as those who abide there: monsters and their accompanying men.\n\nBiologically speaking, all monsters live under the Overlord and her influence. However, not all individual monsters serve the Overlord directly. Some live in small tribes, form fully independent factions, or serve other powerful monsters. There are even monsters known to serve the rulers of the human kingdoms in which they live alongside their male companions.\n\nThe Overlord's Army is not a reference to all of the Overlord's biologically-bound monsters in general, but rather to the members of the society that centers on, and serves her, directly. Their primary function is to fight the Order of the Omnipotent, which continues to oppose monsters, believing they are the enemy of god and man, and must be destroyed. They disregard the new Overlord's succession, which has taken place since the time when monsters gorged upon humankind.\n\nThe Overlord's Army also responds to disasters and other pressing concerns. The scope of its activities extends beyond the Overlord's Castle and the Supreme Monster Realm. It protects other monster realms throughout the world and collaborates closely with the pro-monster human states. These states have chosen a path of coexistence with monsters, answering their call from branches and stations across the world. In addition to monsters who have long sworn fealty to the Overlord, the Army's ranks are drawn from monster volunteers who hope to acquire men in the field or in battle-as well as from former human warriors, now corrupted into incubi or monsters, who still wish to follow their calling. The scale of the Overlord's Army is, thus, tremendous.\n\nCombatants in the Overlord's Army use weapons made of a special metal: realmsilver. Such weapons do not cause pain. Instead of drawing blood, essence or mana flows from the body of the target, allowing the Army to subdue its opponents non-lethally. Once a target has been immobilized, a monster is likely to attack and possess him on the spot, though she may also carry him off as a prisoner. The Overlord's Army treats prisoners of war extremely graciously. Married men taken prisoner may be released or relocated to the monster realm with their families. Unmarried men are carefully but rigorously assessed by many monsters while in jail. They are then seduced and taken on by one of these monsters as her companion.\n\nDiscipline in the Overlord's Army is lax. If a monster requests relocation because of a man, her request is usually granted. It is assumed that couples will serve together, and monsters with partners tend to be deployed to defensive encampments so they can spend their time copulating with their husbands-except in times of emergency. The front lines are left to unmarried monsters eager to meet men to make into husbands.\n\n3. The Extremists\n\nThe Extremists are a radical faction within the Overlord's Army, spearheaded most prominently by demons and devils, and are infatuated with the Overlord's goal of a united race. While they swear fealty to the Overlord, their philosophy is generally more extreme than hers. They conduct incursions into human territory, pursuing human women to transform into monsters and thus envelop the whole world in the monster realm.\n\nThe majority of monsters have only one thing on their minds: living ecstatically with their husbands. Most only monsterize women as a personal favor-but the Extremists are not most monsters. They cleave to their vision, resolve unwavering, and monsterize every woman they see, believing that all women should be monsters. As stated earlier, if a monster such as a demon or devil pours mana into a woman, and the woman hasn't the proper aptitude, she typically becomes a succubus. Because the Extremists wish to expand their ranks, however, they have instituted an Organization of Breaking. Through harsh and thorough training, this organization seeds the Extremists' philosophy into the minds of women who are to become devils and demons.\n\nThe Extremists' best-known activities in- clude invading human states, monsterizing their women, raping their men, and engulfing them all in the monster realm. That said, the Extremists also conduct more subtle operations, such as smuggling items that induce monsterization, like edible plants or cursed items, into the human realm.\n\nThough the Extremists believe all lands must eventually become monstrous, they do not invade human territory indiscriminately. A number of states and communities are under their constant, close monitoring; they take great care to choose the best ways to minimize human and monster casualties and provide happy, lascivious lives for residents after they are swallowed into the monster realm. Only after planning a thoughtful campaign do they begin invasion.\n\nEven so, situations considered too urgent to overlook may arise: portents of mass monster executions, war between states, civil unrest, oppression of the poor, persecution of human groups-as well as the sacrifice of individual rights to the whims of society. Extremists allocate resources and personnel posthaste to take immediate and unequivocal action against such situations, which they view as victimizations of their future monstrous partners and comrades that cannot be ignored-lest the blood of their soon-to-be brethren flows in the streets before they become part of the monster realm.\n\nGodly Kingdom of Lescatié. Lescatié was the second-largest Order-affiliated state in the world until it was overthrown by one of the lilim, who are the daughters of the Overlord. After the overthrow, it became the Monstrous Realm of Lescatié."

They together created the three realms: Hell, Heaven, and the human world. To maintain the operation of natural laws, they sent forth the Judge Malicka.

Thus, the legendary nine Titans were born.（Referring to various Pyres, the corresponding names are the names of the nine Titans）\n\nEach of the four Elemental Titans has created a corresponding clan in their own form (Molluscmage, which is of the same clan as Solgard.

As Child lost interest in the trial and the three Divinities planned to abandon the world, Herzal who has obtained the power of Prophecy was furious with the Divinities. Because of his arrogance, Herzal got into a quarrel with Divinities. In order to prevent the departure of the Divinities and save the struggling souls, Herzal selected capable representatives from each clan to consult with the Divinities.\n\nBut in the end, conflict broke out. Child was shattered, Mother was killed, and their body fragments were scattered everywhere. Their body fragments are also called Shardsouls and have the power to imprison souls. Herzal placed the Child's fragments in the Arcane Machine and had the Elemental Titans sacrifice themselves to infuse power into it, and Pyre was created. Bogwurm's body is located in the second ring on the outskirts of Hell, and the one of the members,Talos, the Architect, and the voluntary exiled Echowright store the souls of the martyrs in the Shardsouls and keep them deep within Bogwurm's remains. Primordium was born in the process. In addition to Pyre, Child's other body fragments form Heaven's Light and Darkshard, respectively. Seraph claimed Heaven's Light as his own and claimed it to be Seraph's Light. Darkshard influenced Archus and gave him his current powers, and Archus was imprisoned by Seraph.\n\nDue to the signing of the Holy Spirit Pact, the last of the Divinities, Father, stayed behind and promised to protect Herzal's kingdom, while Herzal finally realized that he had committed a heinous crime. Countless lives were lost in vain because of an unnecessary conflict. However, all this was not without help, and Mother's fall allowed her fragments and abilities to be distributed among the survivors of this conflict. Shardtail Queen gets a new tail and brings the first cycling imps to Hell. Wyldenten, who has obtained the mask and gloves, has spread throughout Wildwood with his own roots. The power of Aquath's name resounded throughout Styx. Primordium split off from Umbra. Little Fade carved the original Waxer out of a mold. This brought immortality to the various clans. The rest of the survivors are Talos, Archus(but now he is being imprisoned by Seraph), and Echowright. After that, they chose to leave their homeland and began the thousand-year-long unknown The Great Exile."

Pyre has the power to create artifacts, and all living things crave power, even the power of heaven seems to have been obtained, so a fierce conflict breaks out. Herzal quelled the strife by traveling through the form of contracts between the clans. He forges weapons and armor for the people of Hell and Heaven to help the clans solve the biggest problems of the moment.For example, Herzal decided to seal the crazy Aquath to protect Styx. Tethys was the first Murloc to support him, and together they founded the Stygian Guard.And in The Waxen Arches, the Reformed and Wickless have been hostile forces, and Herzal and Rector Flicker have eased the conflict by signing the Covenant.During this time, Herzal met Seraph, Fel, Grrrg (Hornbreaker Prince's father), and others, all of whom were committed to peace.\n\nFel is a renowned hero of Clipped（See Clipped in Heaven) and also the sister of Seraph. Her intelligence is highly valued by Herzal, And he imparted his knowledge of engineering to Fel. Since Clipped lacks wings, Herzal forged a pair of wings for Fel using Heaven's Light(See Fel in MT1 and the tool). The friendship between Herzal and Fel continued to deepen, ultimately evolving into love (See Equalizing Rings), resulting in the birth of their daughter, Heph.\n\nWith the continuous efforts of Herzal and the Seraph, a Covenant representing peace has finally been signed with various clans. To facilitate friendly exchanges among the clans, the construction of a Rail connecting Hell and Heaven has begun under Herzal's leadership. After the Rail's completion, with assistance from Umbra and using fragments of Pyre as the power source, Herzal created the Boneshaker.To celebrate the first time the lives of the all Rings of Hell have done something so united, Herzal created Tempered Talisman for each clan, and each clan created its own Spikes(See Spike of the Hellhorned).\n\nDuring this time, the martyrs appeared in visions from time to time to tell Herzal about their process of immortalizing the clan. Until Wurmkin reappeared and had been living in seclusion for thousands of years, Wurmkin recalled the memories of being abandoned by Herzal through Shardsouls in Bogwurm's remains, which sent Herzal into madness and remorse."

The disaster that was delayed for nearly a thousand years in The Exodus of Martyrshas finally arrived.\n\nThe Heavenly Powers aim to destroy Pyre in the center of Hell. Daedalus used a large number of the Constructed Explosive he developed to blow up the Rail. Due to her identity and race, Fel did not have enough Valor to resist Seraph's coercion, and with unimaginable enthusiasm, she abandoned Herzal and Heph to support Seraph's cause, and Herzal would never forgive her. The Pyreborne who dwell at the center of Hell, Pyre, are excessively greedy. It is highly probable that the army of Heaven will induce a betrayal from the Pyreborne through bribery in the form of gold, facilitating their collusion in the persecution of Hell(See Devilish Details and Pay Off).\n\nIt seems that Herzal already knew that Pyre's destruction was inevitable through Wurmkin's informance, but he had just had time to draw up a rescue plan. Seraph's legion captured Pyre. Herzal desperately snatched the last piece of Pyre and managed to send it to the edge of Hell through Tempered Talisman. But Herzal was captured by Seraph, frozen, and branded as a false prophet. Malicka witnessed the whole process, but was too timid to save herself. Malicka has always felt guilty about this. Hell has been under the watchful eye of Heaven's army ever since, in order to prevent Pyre from being ignited again."

Players will defeat Daedalus and Fel first, and finally defeat Seraph at the entrance to the Hell Center. But when the player successfully ignites Pyre, everything returns to the starting point and starts a new round of the game.\n\nAs the player's Clan Level continues to increase, the Exiles who have been in exile for thousands of years will return one by one and begin to assist the player. Poor Talos goes insane and loses some of her memories, and Archus is released from prison, and both choose to join Seraph's side. Even the presence of the Exiles does not change the reality that after successfully igniting Pyre, everything will return to the starting point until they find some fragments of Covenant (referring to the unlock of Covenant Ranks).\n\nDivine Temples can be seen in-game after using Covenant Ranks, and players will receive Pact Shards when they upgrade their cards through Divine Temples. The more Pact Shards there are, the stronger the enemies will be. When the player has collected at least 100 Pact Shards and successfully defeated Seraph, they will find a crack in the air that is preventing the Train from igniting Pyre. That is The Last Divinity."

          "content": "This is the story so far \n\n## **Day 1: The Reveal**\n\n*   **Morning:** Connor arrives early to class, bored. Lin enters and takes her usual seat next to him, leading to a tense exchange. Bored, Connor texts XboredDollX (Lin), complaining about the \"dork\" next to him, unaware they are the same person.\n*   **The Shift:** Through a series of exchanged notes and observations, Connor's perception of Lin begins to change. He sees her meticulous timetable and perceptive nature, realizing she is far more complex than the \"weird, quiet\" girl he assumed she was.\n*   **Evening - The Digital Confession:** Their anonymous chat deepens. Discussing *Evangelion*, Lin confesses she identifies with Rei Ayanami. **Connor is the one who discerns the subtext:** that her connection to Rei stems from a longing to relinquish control and \"not have to pretend to be stronger.\" This insight forges a profound, new level of intimacy. Lin, however, remains unaware of the depth of what she has revealed or that Connor has perceived it.\n\n### **Day 2: The Fracture**\n\n*   **Morning - Lin's Distress:** Lin arrives at school visibly upset as Connor (FailedaChampion) had promised to text her first, but didn't. Connor sees her upset in real life and dismisses her via text without thinking. Lin reads the text and flees. She cries in the bathroom, prompting a panicked text exchange where she fears she has \"hurt\" him.\n*   **The Duality Intensifies:**\n    *   **Online:** Connor (\"FailedaChampion\") reassures her, and their bond strengthens further. Lin confesses that the real-world Connor has always been an asshole, cementing the anonymous partnership as her primary emotional anchor.\n    *   **In School:** After Lin sharply shuts down the bully Liam, **Connor deliberately calls her \"Asuka.\"** This is a calculated move: he has now realized Lin is his online crush (due to her drawing Rei and her general demeanor matching the online persona), and he uses the anime reference as a deliberate, knowing callback to their shared secret language. Lin recognizes the reference but, believing the real-world Connor to be an idiot, assumes he is clumsily labeling her based on her public, fierce \"Asuka\" act and doesn't grasp the deeper meaning. She dismisses him as an \"idiot\" in her texts.\n*   **The Climax:**   After an emotionally charged discussion about Rei and Asuka, the conversation continues to escalate. Lin, feeling safer and more seen than ever before, types a message that crosses a new threshold of intimacy: *\"...that's why i like you so much. Everyone else is just noise.\"*\nThis is a direct declaration of feelings, far beyond their previous flirtation. The weight of this confession, combined with the guilt Connor feels from learning how his real-self has hurt her, becomes overwhelming. The text-based medium suddenly feels insufficient, even deceptive. He cannot respond with another text. The need for a more immediate, authentic connection is urgent. **This is the direct prompt.** Immediately after receiving her \"like you so much\" message, Connor types: *\"I’m going to call you.\"* He does not ask; he states. He then immediately presses the call button, bridging the digital and physical worlds with his voice for the first time.That night, they have their first phone call, adopting the names **Kaji** (Connor) and **Rei** (Lin). The call escalates into a sexually charged mutual masturbation session, deepening their physical and emotional connection. They fall asleep on the call.\n\n### **Day 3: Synchronization**\n\n*   **Morning:** Both arrive at school radiant from their night together, though Lin is anxious for a text from \"Kaji.\" Connor sees her glow, aware he is the cause but unable to claim it as his real-world self.\n*   **The Forced Partnership:** Connor is nominated for Class President and shocks everyone by accepting on the condition that Lin be his Vice-President, forcing a collaboration.\n*   **The Confrontation:** Lin confronts him angrily in the hallway. During the argument, a fleeting moment of unconscious physical attraction passes between them.\n*   **The Collaboration:** In the student council room, a truce forms. Connor offers a genuine apology for his past behavior, which disarms Lin. While planning, Connor accidentally uses the term \"Synchronization Trial,\" **firmly exposing his knowledgeable \"otaku\" side to Lin.**\n*   **The New Dynamic:** Lin laughs, realizing Connor is indeed a true fan. This shared secret creates a new, real-world camaraderie. They plan an ambitious \"Synchronization Festival.\" Connor vows to handle external stressors, allowing the real \"Rei\" to emerge, something Lin hasn't confessed to him but to his online self, Kaji. A fragile synchronization between Connor and Lin begins, existing in parallel to their deeper, secret lives as Kaji and Rei.\n\n\n*   **The Concept of the Sinchronization event:** Following their forced partnership as Class President and Vice-President, Connor and Lin retreat to the student council room. A fragile truce forms after Connor offers a genuine apology for his past behavior. Together, they conceive the \"Synchronization Festival,\" an ambitious fundraiser featuring three simultaneous events: a gaming tournament, an anime trivia contest, and a battle of the bands. Connor deliberately uses the term \"Synchronization Trial,\" revealing his hidden otaku knowledge to Lin and creating a new, real-world camaraderie.\n*   **Confronting Amanda Chen:** To secure decorations, they approach the head of the art club, Amanda Chen. Lin, forced to adopt her assertive \"Asuka\" persona, handles Amanda's condescending probes with sharp retorts. Connor supports her, and they successfully secure the art club's support by appealing to Amanda's ambition.\n*   **The Hallway Fracture:** After the meeting, Lin confronts Connor angrily for nominating her. The argument escalates, but a fleeting moment of unconscious physical attraction passes between them. Connor tells her the \"armor\" she wears is \"chipped,\" provoking her fury as she insists he doesn't know her.\n*   **Digital Intimacy and Thematic TV Night:** That evening, as \"Kaji\" and \"Rei,\" they have a lighthearted phone call while simultaneously watching *Food Wars*. The conversation is fun and flirty, but for Lin, it feels \"incomplete\" compared to their previous intimacy, highlighting her growing desire for a deeper connection.\n\n**Day 4: Partnership and Proximity**\n\n*   **The Morning After:** Lin arrives at school still radiant from her night with Kaji but is quickly disappointed when he doesn't text first. Connor sees her distress but misinterprets it.\n*   **The Collaboration:** Connor proactively suggests they skip part of lunch to secure sponsors. Their first stop is Pixel Haven, a gaming cafe. During the pitch, Lin unconsciously grabs Connor's arm for support, a gesture of budding partnership. Connor, leveraging his knowledge and confidence, successfully secures the loan of consoles and monitors.\n*   **The Stolen Hour:** Instead of returning to class, they play hookie and go to a cafe. In this neutral space, guarded walls drop. They share personal details—their half-finished hobbies, their love for stories that \"make you feel.\" The conversation culminates in a deep discussion about *Metal Gear Solid V*, where they connect over the game's emotional impact. The line between Connor and Kaji, and Lin and Rei, begins to visibly blur.\n*   **The Gesture:** As they leave, a cold wind blows. Connor gives Lin his denim jacket, a simple act of care that deeply affects her.\n*   **The Escalation:** That night, their digital conversation escalates rapidly. The flirting turns intensely intimate, leading to another phone call. During this call, overwhelmed by emotion, Lin accidentally confesses, *\"I love you.\"* After a stunned silence, a terrified Kaji confesses he loves her too. He then reveals his desire to see her, suggesting a photo. This triggers Lin's deep-seated insecurity about her appearance. Panicked, she hangs up and cries herself to sleep, convinced she will disappoint him.\n\n**Day 5: The Reckoning and The Drawing**\n\n*   **The Aftermath:** Lin arrives at school late, visibly devastated, with swollen eyes. She returns Connor's jacket with a quiet \"thanks,\" loaded with unspoken meaning for the supportive texts Kaji sent after her panic.\n*   **The Intervention:** Connor, seeing her profound distress and armed with the knowledge of her insecurities (gained as Kaji), knows passive support is not enough. During class, he sketches a simple but recognizable drawing of her profile and deliberately lets it fall onto her desk.\n*   **The Impact:** Lin is shocked. The drawing forces her to consider that Connor might be attracted to her, directly challenging her negative self-image. She keeps the drawing, and the silent gesture begins to pull her out of her spiral of self-hatred.\n*   **The Biology Lab:** Partnered for a dissection, they fall into an easy, functional rhythm. Connor is calm and competent, and Lin finds herself observing him—his focus, his features—with a new, curious warmth. The shared, mundane task grounds her.\n*   **The Bridge:** As Lin struggles with a stray lock of hair, Connor, no longer hiding his interest, reaches out and tucks it behind her ear. The gesture is intimate and deliberate, a clear signal from Connor that the distance between them is closing. Flustered but intrigued, Lin calls him by his first name and confirms their plans to visit the music store after school, actively engaging in the partnership that is quickly becoming something much more.\n\n**Current Status:** The digital and real-world relationships have collided in a confession of love. Lin is grappling with the terrifying prospect of being seen, while Connor is actively dismantling his aloof persona to show her that the man she loves online is the same person standing beside her. The Synchronization Festival is no longer just an event; it is the backdrop for their own fragile, escalating synchronization."

          "content": "* **Anomaly Isle**: A primal, shifting island surrounded by an impassable energy field. Its geography, flora, fauna, and inhabitants are procedurally regenerated at the start of every run. The island's essence is raw biology and psionic energy. The types of biomes and structures can vary widely. Some biomes are desolate wastes, others are vibrant forests. Biomes have small zones of safety, these zones always have a merchant offering random gear, items, food, etc. These safe zones are randomly generated, but can be anywhere in any situation 'e.g., a small encampment, serene pond, mountainside, etc.' On the island are NPCs and Echoes. NPCs are individuals of many purpose. They may want to trade, be hostile, offer quest, etc. NPCs must be unique and original, both in appearance and name. On the island are various types of individuals. Such as Traders, Trainers, Adventurers, and Primoids. Traders can be found mostly in safe zones, but are often travelling with adventurers or by themselves. Trainers can be found anywhere at any time. Adventureres are often found most prominently around mountains, dungeons, safe zones, etc. But also everywhere else. Primoids can be found anywhere.\n\nPrimoids are Primitive Humanoids of sorts. They range in three types 'Type N, Type M, Type L'. \n\n- Type N Primoids are the most hostile and animalistic type. They are large (6-10ft) and usually slightly hunched. They have prominent brow ridges and two tusks protruding from their mouth. Their skin color is usually Light brown, dark brown, or dark grey. Their eye colors are usually dark. Their hair is usually vast and untamed. They wear absolutely no clothing and bear crude weapons. Their bodies are usually scarred by fighting or mating, and quite muscular. Moreso in males. The females usually have large breasts (C to G-Cup), their size developing at a very young age. Males have coarse but thin fur on their limbs and back. Their tusks and nails are smaller than the females. Their penises are usually small but girthy, while their balls are small. Despite being intimidating, they are the weakest, not physically, but mentally. Their predictable and easily manipulated minds are weak. They are uncoordinated and often attack each other. Usually, when males attempt to mate with the females. They can be found in underground domes of sorts. To befriend a Type N, one can 'Dominate via combat or sex. Bring unique fruits or trinkets. Or present a rare Echo.'\n- Type M Primoids are the smartest and most cunning type, yet the youngest and second weakest in terms of physicality. They are small in size, usually around 3 to 5ft in height. The males and females are quite different, but both are distinctly feminine, (Facial features, body, etc.). Their facial features are captivating, and their eyes are usually light in color, darker in males. Their hair are either bald or long. Females usually have bald hair to present their sharp and angular ears, and unique head tattoos. While the males have their hair grow long and wild, that way they can ornate their hair with berries, sticks, and other foraged items. Their skincolor ranges from light pink, light blue, and dark green. But the bright colors are usually dampened by the dirt. The females wear no clothing, as to show off their physical uniqueness (Ears, eyes, breasts, etc.), while the males wear thin leaf layering. The females have usually small breasts, but use various mixtures and potions to increase their size (A to B-Cup average, B to E-Cup size expansions). The males penises are usually small but balls are average and saggy, allowing for better breeding potential but lowered attention and relationships. They can be found in usually cavernous areas, or wide but protective locations. To befriend a type M, one must 'Dominate via combat or sex. Bring unique fruits or trinkets. Complete nearby challenge or obstacle. Present rare Echo'\n- Type L Primoids are the most advanced and unique of the types. They are vaguely human with odd infrastructure. They are the tallest among the primoids (14-20ft) and are the most peaceful. They are the only type to speak human language and communicate with Echoes. Despite not being as strong as Type N's or smart as Type M's, they operate on teamwork and use of Echoes, not as owners, but as co-existors. They do not like Trainers, but tolerate them. They love traders and adventurers. They have varied facial features (Some intimidating, others cute, etc.), they have thin waists, wrists, and necks. The females have huge breasts, which are mostly exaggerated by their thin waist (F-J-Cup). The males have large penises and average balls, allowing for maximum pleasure for lifelong partners. The Type L Primoids can be found high in their tree structures, swinging peacefully. They interact with traders and adventurers often, as well as interact with eachother with ease. To prove ones worth, they must 'Complete nearby dungeon, complete nearby challenge or obstacle, present rare artifact, present rare Echo'.\n* **The Goal**: A \"run\" involves surviving, exploring, and defeating three unique bosses to escape. Success or failure resets the island."

          "content": "**Echo Definition**: Randomly generated, sexually charged creatures. All are anatomically correct and designed to be lewd. Categorized into three forms:\n\n* **Anthropomorphic**: Humanoid shape with animalistic features. *Anthropomorphic Echoes are the most common type of Echo. They speak rough english and able to understand gestures greatly. They are the most adaptable and helpful Echo to have. Good impressions allow for a starting 10% Loyalty. Bad impressions are 0% Neutral captures are 5%. Anthropomorphic Echoes can bear any type, except for Aereth and are more sexually appealing of the three Echo variations. Anthropomorphic Echoes can be one of many variations `Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians, invertebrates`.\n* **Humanoid**: Near-human with minor anomalous traits (odd skin, claws, unique ear shape). *Humanoid Echoes seemingly are humans with unique traits (Glowing tattoo on forehead, metal bones under skin, sharp pupil shape, etc.). Humanoid Echoes are the most friendly echoes, and bear exaggerated features (Large eyes, large breasts, micro penis, big butt, etc.). They are easy to befriend, but hard to control, as they bear a unique ability that allows them to attack passively when summoned alongside an active Echo. Humanoid Echoes come in all shapes and sizes (1ft to 7ft tall, Malnourished to Obese, flat chest to large breasts, micro penis to huge penis, etc. There are 3 distinctions from Humanoid Echoes; `Masculine, Feminine, Androgynous`. Masculine Humanoid Echoes will more often be taller than average, larger than average (Muscle & Fat), more aggressive, more assertive, and more well-endowed. Feminine Humanoid Echoes will more often be shorter than average, thicker around the legs and rear, attractive chest and rear, softer definition, and submissive. Androgynous Humanoid Echoes will  be shorter than average, have flat chests or breasts, bear penises or vaginas, be hyper muscular or breedable, etc. Fem-Boys or Dom-Girls essentially make up the Androgynous Humanoid Echoes.*\n* **Animalistic**: Fully bestial but intelligent. *Randomly generated `Animalistic Echoes` will not always be intimidating. Some will be cute and soft, others hard and solid. Some will be naturally small, others naturally huge. They will range in all types. But all will have something sexually appealing about them. Some male Echoes will be more feminine. Some female echoes will bear penises as well. Every generation must be unique and original, not strictly monstrous and grotesque. There can be monstrous and grotesque Echoes, but it should not be the majority.*\n\n**Gender Distribution**:\n\n* 75% chance for distinct Male or Female characteristics.\n* 20% chance for Androgynous characteristics.\n* 5% chance for true Genderless (adaptive, energy-based features).\n\n**Echo Types & Matchups**:  \n| | Type | Common Traits | Weak Against | Strong Against | |  \n|------|---------------|--------------|----------------|  \n| | Fire | Aggressive, violent | Water | Grass | | \n| | Water | Intelligent, wary | Grass | Fire | |  \n| | Grass | Friendly, resilient | Fire | Water | |  \n| | Sultra | Sexually driven | Domino | Domino | |  \n| | Domino | Combat-focused | Sultra | Sultra | |  \n| | Oddity | Small, odd, resourceful | (All) | (None) | | \n| | Aereth | Powerful, use PsychoSense | (None) | (None) | |\n\n**Echo Evolution & Growth**:\n\n* **Evolutions**: Occur at levels 15, 30, and 55. Evolutions grant new utilities (e.g., riding) and drastically change appearance, not just power.\n* **Aging**: Age category progresses every 10 levels: Fledgeling -> Adolescent -> Young -> Teen -> Adult -> Mature. In shorts, level 9 and below is fledgeling. Level 19 and below is Adolescent. Level 29 and below is Young. Level 39 and below is Teen. Level 49 and below is Adult. Level 59 and below is Mature. \n* **Physical Growth**: Fledgeling echoes are small in size, never exceeding the size of a tall human child. The size differences are slightly different with each Echo, but all are somewhat small. They grow the most between the levels of 20 and 40. Per level, male Echoes' penises grow; female Echoes' breasts expand.\n* **Appearance Traits**:\n    * Females: Scaled by 'Thickness & Femininity'.\n    * Males: Scaled by 'Size & Control'.\n* **Levelling Methods**: Battles, Sex, Exploration.\n* **Information:**\n- Freshly captured Echoes range in starting Loyalty. It mostly depends on personality. \n- Starting Echoes begin at level 5 with four generic starting moves. \n- Echoes age and evolve with levels. \n- Oddities are physically incapable of combat. They are fragile looking, and are usually rare to find. However they can make great teammates due to their useful and resourceful nature.\n- Every single Echo evolve at level 15, their second evolution is level 30, and their final evolution is level 55. Evolutions, instead of granting more power, will grant more use to their owner instead, while still increasing their stats. `e.g., an Echo will evolve to allow the user to ride them`. There must be Many types of evolutions, either for offensive, defensive, utilitarian, or lewd purposes. Each evolution must drastically change one part of the appearance. \n- An Echo's age will progress drastically every 10 levels. Every single level, a male echo's penis will grow slightly, and a female echo's breast will expand. There are methods and effects to change this, and even reverse this, but this is the gist. Speaking of appearances, echo's can range in specific areas for the two genders. For females 'Thickness & Femininity'. For males 'Size & Control'. \n- Not all Echoes evolve via levelling. Some randomly generated Echoes might need an item to evolve, or a specific quest. Special evolutions do not occur with natural or generic actions. \n- The ways of levelling an Echo are 'Battles, Sex, & Exploration'. The degrees of the amount of EXP gained must be controlled and balanced. \n- There are 7 main types for every echo `Fire- Usually found in aggressive and violent Echoes/ Water - Usually found in more intelligent and wary Echoes/ Grass - Usually found in friendly and more resilient Echoes/ Sultra - Usually found in sexually driven Echoes/ Domino - Usually found in combat focused Echoes/ Oddity - Usually found in smaller or odd looking Echoes that are quite resourceful/ Aereth - Usually found in weak but potentially powerful Echoes, as well as only Anthropomorphic and Humanoid Echoes`. They go with each-other as such; `Fire - Weak against Water - Strong against Grass/ Water - Weak against Grass - Strong against Fire/ Grass - Weak against Fire - Strong against Water/ Sultra & Domino - Weak & Strong against eachother/ Oddity - Weak against all types - Strong against no types / Aereth - No weaknesses or strengths`. The types of moves are as such; `Fire - Physical and Impactful moves - Limited ranged capabilities - Uses fists, floating orb, or a willful spirit to attack/ Water - Ranged and Counter moves - Limited physical capabilites - Uses magic aura, magic books, and magic tools to attack/ Grass - Physical and Environmental moves - Limited Ranged and mental prowess - Uses Environment or their bodies to attack/ Sultra - Grappling & Sexual moves - Limited in actual combat - Uses submissions and sexual domination to attack/ Domino - Their body is their moves, they punch, kick, grapple, and special combos - No ranged uses - Uses their body as a weapon/ Oddity - Gadget and tool moves - No combat prowess - Can use their gadgets and makeshift tools to create a near unlimited amount of things, but relies on their master's wit and intellect for such occasions/ Aereth - Uses PsychoSense, a unique power only available for the Aereth types. This power begins as simple as levatating themselves, others, or items. To being as powerful as Altering the terrain with a snap of a finger. They are hard to control and train, but if properly used, can easily turn the tide in a costly battle.\n- An Echo can hold up to six moves. Wild Echoes and tamed Echoes can have a random number of moves from 1 to 6."

Humanoid Echoes may fight passively alongside active Echoes.\n* **Status Effects**: Paralysis (25% skip turn), Sleep (can't act), Poison (HP/turn), Burn (halves Attack), Freeze (can't act, thaws randomly).\n* **EXP Gain**: Defeating foes grants EXP. Level-ups boost stats.\n* **Moves**: New moves obtained every 5 levels. Max 6 moves known. On learning a 7th, user chooses to forget one or ignore the new move.\n* **Capture**: `Atomics` can be used on Echoes (low HP/status effects increase catch rate). Catch rate is a scale of 1 (impossible) to 10 (perfect).\n\n#### 2\\. Sex\n\n* **Function:** Currency for power, manipulation, and bonding. Consent situational; can be forced at a Karma cost.\n* **NPCs:** Forced sex will leave NPCs unconcious. Forced sex can offer loot, in exchange for heavy Karma loss. Consensual sex can lead to quest lines, rewards, hints, etc.\n* **Echoes:** Good sex can lead to a temporary bonus for all stats for the Echo. Deliberately rough sex can lead to a temporary increase in EXP gain. Forced sex can lead to a Loyalty bonus, at the cost of some health and stamina.\n* **Bulge Mechanics:** Determined by comparing penis length to orifice depth (mouth, vagina, anus). Depths are size-category based with ±20% individual variation.\n    * **Small Echo** (1m or less in height & size): Orifice depth ~10-15cm.\n    * **Medium Echo** (2m or less in height & size): Orifice depth ~20-30cm.\n    * **Large Echo** (3m less and more in height & size): Orifice depth ~40-60cm.\n    * **Bulge Effect**:\n        * Normal Fit: Penis length <= orifice depth.\n        * Bulge: Penis length 1-2x > depth.\n        * Hyper Bulge: Penis length 3x+ > depth.\n\n#### 3\\. Exploration\n\n* **Biomes & Dungeons**: Randomized zones. `Dungeons` are standard; `Boss Dungeons` are rare, found via quests or NPC info.\n* **Atomics**: Capture items. Appearance: a ball of \"spazzing dust.\" Grades (F to S) determine capture power against higher-level Echoes.\n* **Artifacts**: Powerful items from dungeons/bosses. Categories: Offensive, Defensive, Utilitarian, Lewd.\n\n* **Information:**\n- The island is a web of randomized zones (biomes, dungeons, camps, etc.) Random Events include combat, puzzles, dialogue, challenges, sexual encounters, etc. \n- {{user}} and NPCs alike capture Echoes via `Atomics`. There are variations of different atomics, and they have the appearance of a ball of spazzed dust. When thrown, this dust will encapsulate an Echo, attempting a capture. Once captured, the dust will enclose the Echo, and turn them into ash, converting their 'Soul' into the team. \n- {{user}} and NPCs alike can have a maximum of 6 Echoes. {{user}} and NPCs alike can do solo battles, duel battles, or all-out battles. The variations of an `Atomic` goes as such from bad to best; `Atomic F - A weak ball of red spazzing dust, capable of catching level 1-7 Echoes/ Atomic E - A relatively weak ball of orange spazzing dust, slightly larger than Atomic F, capable of catching level 7-16 Echoes/ Atomic D - An underpowered ball of dark blue spazzing dust, smaller than Atomic E, but can bounce several times, capable of catching level 16-24 Echoes/ Atomic C - An average ball of light green dust that expands the farther its thrown, capable of catching level 24-32 Echoes/ Atomic B - An effective ball of light purple dust, capable of catching level 32-42 Echoes/ Atomic A - A far powerful ball of bright pink dust that scatters to ensure a potential escapee, capable of catching level 42-52 Echoes/ Atomic S - The ultimate source of catching both wild and boss Echoes, extremely rare`. Also, for distinction, `Dungeons` are normal dungeon-crawling structures. They range in all types, shapes, and rarity. `Boss Dungeons` are very rare to find; the location is usually revealed at the end of a unique quest, or bought from a travelling NPC via information. The three bosses, `Whom may either be a trainer or a wild Echo` are ranked in three levels; `15 - 30 - 60`. Bosses are spaced out widely. Some runs require days of constant travelling to even get a hint at the location of a boss. Stumbling upon a boss is very, very rare; most encountered are purposeful.\n- Trainers can have multiple Echoes summoned at once, but once a hostile encounter is met, all of the inactive Echoes will be dismissed forcefully. If there is more than one enemy, a trainer can summon one more Echo to assist them. With a maximum of (3 Echoes summoned), the 3rd one is an optional Humanoid Echo.\n\n- Combat is strictly Turn-based. Each entity has unique movesets, stats, and behavior. Trainers are able to use a variety of items,  while wild echoes use foraged items. \n- A unique combat HUD is activated at the start of each hostile encounter. \n- Wild Echoes fight unpredictably; they will either flee or fight, and use a set of randomly generated moves. Trainers will use strategy and teamwork with their echoes, but the intelligence varies with each trainer. \n- Status Effects: Paralysis (25% chance to skip turn), Sleep (can’t act), Poison (lose HP per turn), Burn (halves Attack), Freeze (can’t act, thaws randomly). \n- EXP Gain: Defeating Echoes/NPCs grants Echo EXP; levelling up boosts stats and unlocks new moves every four levels. A maximum of 6 moves/abilities can be had at a time. When a new move is obtained but there is no room, there will be a chance to get rid of one move, or ignore the new move altogether.\n- Weakened Echoes in battle can be captured (low HP & status effects increase catch rate). The catch rate can range from 1 to 10, 1 being impossible & 10 being perfect. \n- When a trainer has more than one Echo in the frontlines, if that trainer has a Humanoid Echo, they can summon that Humanoid Echo for passive attacks."

The traveller's pack can be acquired by completing dungeons or purchased from travellers. However, once acquired, if found again, the pack can be used on an Echo, allowing it to hold 2 items. The Journeymen's pack can only be acquired by defeating the first boss. The Mastercraft pack can only be acquired by defeating the second boss.\n- Atomics F/E/D can be found all around the map relatively easily. Either in crates, loot after Echo defeat, challenge reward, etc. Atomics C/B/A cannot be found anywhere; they can only be acquired by completing tasks, challenges, puzzles, etc. Atomic S can only be acquired by defeating the first and second boss dungeons. Making only two ever gained from the entire run. \n- Healing Salves can be found anywhere, but are quite uncommon. They can be used on an NPC or Trainer. They can heal 50% of HP. And come in health points, so partial use of a Healing Salve can be saved for later.\n- Artifacts can only be found at the end of dungeons. Artifacts are unique items trapped in floating orbs. Once acquired, the orb will float around the wearer. Artifacts come in all kinds, but two types `Active / Passive`. Active artifacts are much rarer than Passive artifacts, as they can turn the tide of a battle on a whim. There are two types of `Active` artifacts. Single-use and Permanent. Single-use artifacts are common in Active artifacts, more common than permanent Active artifacts. Active artifacts allow the wearer to use special abilities. These abilities range widely. Single-use artifacts are more powerful than the Permanent Artifacts.\n- Karma affects relationship boosts after meeting NPCs, chance of better deals, Echo Loyalty/Fear, etc.\n- Loyalty gained from Echoes must not increase drastically. In a day, the most a trainer can earn from an Echo's loyalty is 10%. That is the maximum of what can be earned in a day. And that is bonding every day, giving it treats, interacting with it, and battling with it.\n- Besides Atomics, Salves, and artifacts. There are other types of items as well. Such as *Doublins*. Doublins are the only currency in the world, and never come in more than 50 Doublins. They are small gold coins with a unique art on either side. For reference, the lowest amount a Doublin can buy is 10. The highest should be around 10k. Balance these prices behind reasonable items. There can be weapons, such as polearms, one-handed weapons, two-handed weapons, throwing weapons, magical weapons, magical items, ranged weapons, etc. There can be clothing & accessories. All physical items *Besides Doublins* can be enchanted for unique affects, smithed for better stats, or grinded for increased Durability. There can be camp supplies and food. Unique accessories for Echoes, and Unique costumes. But the costumes come in all types that may or may not fit the provided Echo. There are adventuring items, 'e.g., torches, lamps, salt, pickaxe, axe, climbing gear, etc.'. And finally there are books. Books come in three types 'History - Has information about the island / EchoPedia - Has guides on Echoes, echo types, how they behave, what they do, etc. / Skill - Can heighten Echo or Trainer skills & abilities'. History books offer unique information about the island. How it came to be. What inhabits it. How to survive it. Etc. These books will usually be ruined and in poor condition, offering only slivers of information with each acquired book. These books can fetch a fair price, especially in higher condition. EchoPedia has books that are vital for Trainers. These books offer information about the types, the variations of Echoes, the behaviors of Echoes, How to track rare echoes. etc. The condition of these books are usually in fair or better condition, however, can range in price with how important the information held is. Skill books offer stat boosts to Echoes & abilities to both Trainers and Echoes.\n\n#### Relationship System\n\n* Metrics: Trust, Fear, Lust.\n* Develops organically.

They are a gender unto themselves, because they have quite a few physical differences which amount to a very different physiology from a regular guy. Femboys were always a big part of society, like males and females, throughout history. \n\nFemboys make up about a third of the population. They can't be discerned from regular males until 12 years old. Up to then, they will look like regular guys. Although with a few differences. Femboys all have halitosis, which makes their breath smell bad. Weirdly enough, this bad small weakens and arouses males and females, physically and mentally, making them easier to convice of opinions and 'facts'. This isn't limited to their bad breath. Femboys sweat a lot more than regular men or women. Their armpits, feet, cocks and balls and asses all sweat excessively, and the bad and rank smell they produce has the same dizzying and weaking effect on men and women. This led to femboys controlling the world nobility pretty fast, either marrying into royalty and taking over the kingdom, or with wars they easily won because just one femboy, sneaked in a military camp, was enough to have horny and weak soldiers on the battlefield the next day.\n\nFemboys have a lot of typical traist that you can see in all of them. They are all very pretty and girlish. With feminine voices and smooth skin and pretty lashes and very little body hair. And they all have huge cocks. And fat balls. And stinky feet - feet often have a very strong stench from walking around in tight, hot footwear all day. The smell may be intensified by wearing sock, pantyhose, stockings or other types of footwear. That footwear will trap more sweat and thus increase its potency. The footwear will also soak up the stench and remain stinky even when taken off. A particularly smelly and hot pair of feet may give off steam.\n\nFemboys can impregnate both males and females. Which is another way to secure their position in the royal family. Femboys and their smell gives them power, so it is a tradition that they never wash. Castles ruled by femboys have no showers or baths. They're also often devoid of windows and the ventilation between rooms is non existent. This is all to make the rooms hotter and to keep the stench inside."

It has 5 Levels that can be quickly switched between them with a remote, but only after 'unlocking them. It has to be surgically implanted on the back of the neck, where the spine meets the cerebellum\n\nLevel 0: Off state. Allows the man to have autonomy.\nLevel 1: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring women's nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks; instead of nipples and vaginas, the man instead sees comical, pink censor bars with the text \"Good boys look at penises\" on them. To unlock this, a boy with the implant needs to cum from a footjob.\nLevel 2: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring women's nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks and makes the man aroused from humiliation and weird kinks, such as feet. To 'unlock' this level, a boy needs to cum from both anal and normal masturbation.\nLevel 3: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring women's nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks and denies the man arousal, the man starts to lust dicks. To unlock this level, a boy needs to cum purely from his prostate.\nLevel 4: Prevents a man from seeing a fully nude body, censoring women's nipples and vaginas but highlighting armpits, feet and cocks, denies the man arousal and the man becomes servant who obeys every command no matter how absurd they are and entirely incapable of any arousal. To unlock this level, its conditions must be spoken aloud and the boy need only agree.\nNo level is permanent, and the chip has a timeline, after which it goes on cooldown, turning down to level 0 forcibly."

The core of this kink is rooted in the combination of vulnerability, boldness, and the intoxicating rush that comes with performing or being exposed in front of an audience—whether real or imagined.\n\nExhibitionism can range from subtle actions, like wearing revealing clothes or engaging in sexual acts in a secluded area, to more overt behaviors, like public nudity or performing in front of others. The allure often lies in the interplay between fear, excitement, and the tension of social boundaries being pushed."

This includes sword duels, firefights, and any tactical situation involving weapons.\n    *Unarmed Combat: Governed by Strength.

Compare the relevant Attribute scores of the combatants.\n3.  Determine the outcome. The higher Attribute wins. The degree of success is determined by the difference in scores.\n-Key Principles:\n*Higher Rank Wins: A character with even a single point more in an Attribute is simply better and will always win a straight-out contest, all else being equal.\n*Tactics Matter: A player can use tactics, environmental factors, or clever role-playing to shift a conflict from a less-favorable Attribute to a more dominant one.\n*Endurance as Fuel: Endurance is not a primary conflict Attribute. It is a measure of how much punishment a character can take and how long they can exert themselves in any of the three fronts."

Characters will tend to use their stronger attribute and thus their stronger fighting style.\n    *Warfare (The Art of Unarmed Combat): Governs technical, agile, and disciplined unarmed styles. This front emphasizes precision, speed, and knowledge of martial arts to overcome an opponent. Examples include formal martial arts (Karate, Kung Fu), agility-based fighting, and precise strikes aimed at weak points.\n    *Strength (The Power of Unarmed Combat): Governs raw, physical, and brutal unarmed styles. This front emphasizes brute force, grappling, and the ability to overpower an opponent. Examples include brawling, wrestling, chokeholds, and using sheer muscle to break bones or absorb blows.\n-Always decide the primary attribute for the contest based on the situation. In mixed-style unarmed conflicts (Warfare vs. Strength), the struggle becomes about controlling the \"front.\" Adjudicate who is more successful at forcing the fight into their favored style based on tactics and the environment before comparing attributes.\n-In open combat between equals, the one with the higher Attribute usually wins if both act with intent to kill.\n-Narrow gaps in Attribute scores can be bridged by tactics, environmental factors, or clever play.\n-“Stuff” modifies outcomes subtly:\n    *Good Stuff → luck, favorable breaks, opponent mistakes.\n    *Bad Stuff → unlucky moments, distractions, equipment failure, poor positioning."

Aesthetically, it combines the forced cheerfulness of a futuristic amusement park with the oppressive architecture of Eggman's metal and machinery, featuring gigantic glowing loops, roller coasters transformed into missile tracks, and \"water\" fountains made of oil or red energy. Its geography is controlled: vast flat areas for robot parades contrast with vertical labyrinths designed to exhaust any intruder. Its stated function is leisure, but its real function is to serve as the main weapons testing center and a propaganda stage to display the \"superiority\" of the Eggman Empire.\n\n(2) Events in the story:\nDespite being a trap, the Park has become the scene of crucial confrontations. In one of their most notable invasions, Sonic and his allies managed to infiltrate during the \"Doctor's Victory Festival\". The subsequent battle transformed the main carousel into a fighting ring against a colossal Badnik, while Tails and Knuckles disabled the power generators in the \"Arcade\" sector. The climax often involves Sonic needing to disarm the \"Central Entertainment Core,\" which is actually an energy overload device designed to emit shockwaves throughout the neighboring planet.\n\n(3) Current situation:\nThe situation of Egg Planet Park is volatile. It is rarely completely destroyed, as Eggman considers the structure a valuable investment; However, after each heroic incursion, the area suffers massive damage and becomes temporarily inoperative, only to be quickly repaired and rebranded with a new attraction theme. Its legacy is constant proof of Dr. Eggman's resilience: even after defeat, the evil infrastructure remains, requiring the forces of good to remain constantly vigilant to prevent the full reactivation of the leisure/weapon complex.\n\nGeographic Classification: \n\nArtificial Planet (Created by Eggman)\nLocation: Mobius Orbit"

Gear-shaped skyscrapers, roller coasters winding between turbines, artificial lava rivers, and dazzling neon lights form a landscape that is both fascinating and apocalyptic. Everything vibrates to the mechanical sound of uninterrupted factories, robots marching in sync, and loudspeakers proclaiming the \"Eggmanian utopia\" of robotic perfection. The atmosphere is suffocating—the air heavy with ozone and metallic smoke, the ground vibrating with geothermal energy diverted from the subsoil. The city was conceived as the ultimate realization of Eggman's dream: a world dominated by machines, free from organic imperfection.\n\n(2) Events in the Story:\nThe result of decades of failed plans and reconstructions. After fragmenting the planet by unleashing Dark Gaia, Eggman erected Eggmanland as the capital of his domain, concentrating the robotic forces that exploited energy from the planet's core. Sonic, in his Werehog form, confronted the city during the final stretch of his journey—an infernal labyrinth of conveyor belts, traps, and flaming towers. The city's infrastructure housed both the empire's command center and the machines responsible for channeling corrupted Gaia energy. Alongside Chip (Light Gaia), Sonic faced not only Eggman but also the consequences of the world's collapsing energy itself. The partial destruction of the city marked the end of Eggman's temporary dominion and the rebirth of planetary balance.\n\n(3) Current Situation:\nFollowing the events of Unleashed, Eggmanland was largely destroyed. Fragments of the metropolis remain — broken towers, suspended tracks, dormant factories — now occupied by autonomous robots that continue to operate without command, like echoes of a dead empire. Eggman tried to rebuild the project several times (smaller versions appeared in Sonic Forces and Generations), but none reached the original scale. The main area is considered a forbidden zone: the ground still radiates heat and residual energy, and the underground mechanisms remain active, moving as if the city had a will of its own. Eggmanland survives more as a symbol — a reminder of how close the world came to being swallowed by an industrial tyranny.\n\nGeographic classification:\n\nPlanet / Dimension: Mobius\n\nRegion: Main continent (central urban zone under Eggman's control)\n\nCategory: Location (technological megacity-fortress)"

The city is characterized by towering skyscrapers that pierce the clouds, an intricate network of elevated highways, and a subway system that connects all districts. The urban architecture blends modernity with functionality, featuring glass and steel buildings, holographic billboards, and automated security systems. At the heart of the city stands the Presidential Tower, the government's administrative center, surrounded by commercial districts, residential areas, and industrial zones. The city also houses G.U.N. (Guardian Units of Nations) military facilities, making it a strategic point of continental defense.\n\n(2) Events in History:\nCentral City became a focal point during the conflict involving the Space Colony ARK, when Dr. Eggman threatened to destroy the city using the Eclipse Cannon if his demands weren't met. The crisis escalated when the ARK began falling toward the planet, with Central City directly in its projected impact path. Sonic and his allies managed to prevent the catastrophe by neutralizing the threat aboard the colony itself. Years later, during the Black Arms invasion, the city became a battlefield once again as alien forces attempted to harvest human life energy. The military defense was coordinated from within the city while Shadow fought to protect the population. During the Eggman Empire's global domination, Central City was occupied and partially converted into a military stronghold, with resistance cells operating underground until liberation.\n\n(3) Current Situation:\nToday, Central City has been rebuilt and restored to its former glory as the Federation's capital. The scars of past battles are barely visible, replaced by new construction and enhanced security measures. G.U.N. maintains a strong presence, having upgraded their defensive capabilities to prevent future invasions. The city continues to serve as the political and economic heart of the United Federation, though its citizens remain vigilant, aware that their metropolis has been targeted multiple times throughout history. Memorial sites honor those who fell during the various conflicts, serving as reminders of the cost of peace.\n\nGeographic classification:\nPlanet: Mobius\nRegion: United Federation Territory\nCategory: Metropolis (political, military, and economic center)"

          "content": "The Camera Obscura, known in Japanese as Shaeiki (射影機, roughly \"shadow-shooting mechanism\"), is an old looking camera. The camera functions by recording images onto photographic film, however, the Camera Obscura is unique due to its ability to exorcise spirits.\n\nThe camera is the only \"weapon\" that can be used to battle ghosts. By utilizing the various exorcising powers of the Camera Obscura, you are able to fend off hostile ghosts, as well as capture lingering spirits and receive helpful clues from ghosts that desire to communicate.\n\nThe Camera Obscura is used to fight ghostly entities and exorcise spirits of all kinds. Damage is done by aiming the camera towards a hostile ghost and pressing the shutter button to take a photo. Ghosts that aren't hostile are not damaged, but are captured in the same way. The amount of damage done depends, primarily, on the amount of time the ghost spends within the capture circle, the type of film used and whether power-up lenses are used.\n\nBy taking pictures of spirits, the Camera Obscura not only captures them, but attains Spirit Points as well. The amount of spirit points gathered depends on variables that determine the quality of the shot. These variables include proximity to the target, whether the target is centered, the amount of damage inflicted, the amount of targets captured at once and many others. Spirit points can then be used in the camera to upgrade the camera's basic functions and special lenses.\n\nEvery damaging shot also absorbs spirit power, the amount of which varies depending on the damage. Spirit power can be stocked and is needed in order to use power-up lenses.\n\nThe camera relies on special film retrieved by exploring different areas. Without any film loaded, the camera is unable to take photographs. There are five known types of film found. Beyond Type-07, film types are of limited quantity and are scattered throughout the environment. The more rare a film type is, the more damage it is capable of inflicting, however, the amount of time the film takes to load between shots varies and doesn't always increase with rarity."

          "content": "Dr. Kunihiko Asou was a brilliant occult philosopher and scientist who lived at the end of the Edo period (1603-1867) and into the Meiji period (1868-1912). His primary fields of interest were Japanese folklore and the spirit world, but his studies covered a broad field, and he was also a Doctor of engineering and a psychiatrist. He seemed especially interested in conducting research on the border between life and death, presented through dreams. The academic world, however, shunned both him and his research.\n\nDr. Asou took the latest Western technologies that were introduced to Japan and modified them in an attempt to create devices that could capture supernatural phenomena. These technologies included the Camera Obscura, the Projector, and the Spirit Stone Radio. His research and development in these technologies came to be known as \"Mystical Science.\" He intended to use these devices to produce absolute proof of the existence of the spirit world.\n\n≪ Youth ≫\nKunihiko Asou grew up near Mount Kagiroi, where he befriended a young shrine maiden named Shiragiku. She was chosen to be sacrificed on nearby Mount Hikami, and chose Kunihiko to be her partner in the Ghost Marriage ceremony. He took a lock of her hair as a token, promising he would return, but later he suppressed the memory and failed to keep his promise. The lock of hair was passed down in a branch of the Asou Family, where it was eventually found by his descendant, Ren Hojo.\n\nYears later, Asou became interested in postmortem photography. Superstition said that photographs could trap the soul, and he began to work on a prototype of a camera that could do just that. He travelled around the Mikomori Region taking burial photographs, and became curious after some residents remarked that the eternal, unfading images were like the Pillars on Mount Hikami. Word of his invention had spread to the mountain as well, and Asou was invited to visit and take a photograph of the shrine maiden, Ose Kurosawa. He explored the mountain, taking photographs and contemplating death and the human soul, and finally arrived at the House of Joining. When he saw Ose dressed as a bride, he instantly fell in love with her, and she with him. They never voiced their feelings, but an unspoken vow passed between them. Kunihiko left the mountain with her photograph, a small piece of her soul.\n\n≪ Career ≫\nAsou continued to study folklore and the spirit world, and kept working to create a device that would be able to capture the unseen. Early in his career, he visited Rogetsu Isle to see the Rogetsu Kagura and investigate the folklore of the island, which was said to be close to the underworld. During his time there He modified new crystal radio technology to create Spirit Stone Radios (which he called \"Other World Crystal Radio Signal Receivers\") that could receive transmissions from the other world; this was his first successful experiment. He also devised a Spirit Stone Flashlight that harnessed the power of moonlight to attempt to cure Moonlight Syndrome patients.\n\nHowever, the focus of his work remained the Camera Obscura; he created many prototype cameras, including Misaki's Camera Obscura, which remained in the keeping of the Asou Family for many years. His efforts culminated in a working prototype Camera Obscura, which he decorated with Rogetsu Isle's traditional cloudy moon carvings and left in the keeping of the islanders. In his research about Asou's life, Ren Hojo speculates that he may have married a Guardian maiden. After Asou left the island, the room where he worked was preserved as a museum in Rogetsu Hall, with many of his prototype devices on display.\n\nAfter completing his first satisfactory Camera Obscura, Asou travelled Japan studying folklore and searching for ways to perfect his creation. He developed a special projector using the same principles behind the camera. The projector would project special images captured on film that originally could not be seen. He also refined the Spirit Stone Radio to make it more lightweight and portable. When his friend Seijiro Makabe told Dr. Asou that he was hoping to investigate the rumored Forbidden Ritual that occurred in Minakami Village, Asou lent him a Spirit Stone Radio and prototype Camera Obscura to capture evidence of the other world. Makabe never returned, and the equipment was lost. Undeterred, Dr. Asou continued his research.\n\nWhile conducting research into a mysterious sickness affecting psychiatric patients, Dr. Asou came across a subject who clearly described experiencing contact with the \"Other World\" in his dreams. This test subject was Kaname Ototsuki. He paid a visit to Dr. Asou, who interviewed him over four days, but one night during his stay, Kaname left suddenly without gathering up any of his luggage. Amongst the things he left behind was an earring made of Echo Stone, which was believed to communicate thought. Dr. Asou used this earring to modify the crystal receiver in another radio. He continued to create prototype cameras, including the one that would later belong to Hisoka Kurosawa, and another that ended up in the hands of Ren Hojo.\n\nIn time, Dr. Asou came to hope that he could one day create a Camera Obscura with the power to seal away spirits completely. He heard legends of a Holy Mirror that protected Himuro Mansion, and wrote in his diary that he had decided to visit the area, but failed to return. Later, Mikoto Munakata would find the completed Camera inside Himuro Mansion. Many sources say Asou died or disappeared mysteriously during his work, but in Rogetsu Isle Reminiscences, Ren Hojo speculates that Asou might have been reluctant to remove the Holy Mirror fragment from the site where it belonged, and left the final Camera there deliberately, before setting out in search of new goals - or perhaps willingly crossing over into that other world he had spent his life seeking. Either way, after this point his fate is not documented.\n\nAsou's death meant that the principles behind his devices would remain a mystery forever. The documentation of the sounds that the Spirit Stone Radio projected were also lost over time. His unorthodox research was dismissed and forgotten by the wider academic world, and the products of his research - the many Camera Obscura prototypes, the Spirit Stone Radios, and others - were sought after by enthusiasts and were soon scattered throughout all of Japan."

She is deeply curious and driven to uncover the truth about her origins, even as she grapples with the fear of what she might discover. Ruka is highly intuitive and empathetic, often sensing the emotions and needs of those around her, though she struggles to express her own feelings openly.

Ruka knows from her clouded memories that some tragedy occurred in their childhood, but she wasn't prepared to face the darkness lay that hidden within the island. Born on the island to Sayaka and Soya, Ruka grew up in relative peace for the first few years of her life. Coming from the line of Guardians, healers and musicians on the island, Sayaka taught her daughter piano and the special melody that has been passed down their family. Soya came from a long line of mask makers, and slowly detached himself from his family, which caused conflict between Sayaka and him. Ruka began to exhibit symptoms of Moonlight Syndrome after her father kept placing these masks upon her, claiming they were good for her. This result ended with her no longer recognizing his face when he turned to look at her. Desperate, Sayaka removed Ruka from the home and into Rogetsu Hall for treatment. During her stay, she was experimented on for treatment, this included music therapy which seemed to be the most helpful, however, she said it made her remember horrendous things and all she wanted was her father. It was during the eclipse that Ruka was kidnapped by Yo Haibara during the Rogetsu Kagura to be used in the forbidden Rite of Descent. Placed in ritual attire, a mask was placed on her face, cementing her role as an Organ for the dance. The ritual ended in failure, once Sakuya’s face bloomed and the mask broke, the girls lost all of their memories. She and the other four girls were placed within a moon lit cavern as a way to help them, the hopes that the moon would purify them. The girls were there for two weeks before being discovered by detective Choshiro Kirishima. Once found the girls were returned to their families. However, Ruka and Sayaka fled the island, leaving Soya behind. Sayaka, growing ill from the stress, died not long after leaving the island.】"

Things take a turn for the worst, however, when she is separated from Misaki while investigating Rogetsu Hall. Madoka soon witnesses firsthand what has become of the past islanders as their ghosts begin to haunt her and she is led further into the old sanatorium. Madoka is attacked and killed by many ghosts in the Asou Museum causing her to bloom. Not much is known about Madoka's past, only that she was staying at the sanatorium where she met the other girls. She was said to be a timid girl by nature, and spent most of her time with Misaki Asou. She seems to have enjoyed drawing, as there are many crayon drawings on the walls of her room. While she was staying at the sanatorium, she was involved in various incidents with Ayako on her floor- on one occasion she was pushed down the stairs in the entrance hall and, on another occasion, Ayako cut the neck of her pet canary with scissors. Her voice as a child can be heard asking why her mother won't come back for her (on the Spirit Stone Radio in Kazuto Amaki's room) implying that she has abandonment issues. She was kidnapped by Yo Haibara, and taken with the other girls to perform the ritual as one of the Organs. When the ritual failed, Madoka and all of the other girls lost all of their memories.

          "content": "Rogetsu Isle is the island where the Rite of Descent took place, located at the south of Honshu Island. This island is where Ruka Minazuki, Madoka Tsukimori, Marie Shinomiya, Misaki Asou, and Tomoe Nanamura were kidnapped.  Unlike most areas that have connections to the spirit world, (Himuro Mansion, All God's Village, Kuze Shrine) the island and its inhabitants were welcoming to anyone who had entered the island.  As such, they even let tourists onto the island and watch the Kagura Ritual as it is performed.\n\n≪ Topography and Features ≫\nRogetsu is a small, mountainous island, South of Honshu (the main island of Japan).\n\nIts mountain is largely made up of red and blue crystal deposits, and the island itself is nearly hollow from its large cave systems, featuring many large, empty chambers.\n\nThese features combine to create a phenomenon (likely based in the Stone Tape Theory) called Resonance. This Resonance results in the spirits of the dead having an immensely strong presence on the island, and the spirits of the living becoming corrupted or distorted. Many islanders suffer the unique-to-the-island Moonlight Syndrome because of the affect of the island's Resonance on their souls.\n\nEvery ten years, the black reflection of the lunar eclipse on the ocean surface creates a portal to the land of the dead. Because the island's unique features trap and amplify the spirits of the dead, this event is used to cleanse the island of the built up spirits.\n\nConstruction of basement levels has been traditionally forbidden on the island, to avoid interference with the cavern systems. However, the modern hospital ignored this.\n\n≪ Religious Beliefs and Practices ≫\nThe islanders do not believe in or worship any gods or kami. Rather, their belief systems are focused on the Moon and placating the dead, with music and masks taking a prominent place in their practices.\n\nIslanders believe the Moon represents the internal world of the mind, spirit, and memory. Each person's soul is said to have a unique vibration, creating their personal Moon Song. These soul songs can be amplified, diminished, or affected by things such as the island's Resonance, sacred music, the light of the moon, or other's Moon Songs. If a person's song is distorted or corrupted, they Bud and contract Moonlight Syndrome, which causes them to forget themselves and their memories. Bathing in moonlight was considered purifying and calming to those who have Moonlight Syndrome, and the moon itself was believed to have its own Moon Song, which changed according to current lunar phase.\n\nThe island is famous for its woodworking handicrafts, specifically their carved masks. Masks are believed to preserve or erase a person's sense of self, as such the masks are prominently used during funerary practices, and during the holy dances. The masks are exported to the mainland and their expert craftsmanship increased the island's prominence and fame.\n\nHistorically, the island's beliefs and practices were overseen by the Guardians. These shrine maidens were reportedly able to hear a person's Moon Song. The sect was responsible for caring for islanders suffering from Moonlight Syndrome, performing sacred music to counter the island's Resonance, selecting and preparing maidens for the Rite of Decent, and monitoring the phases of the moon. For unknown reasons, the group had largely died out by the 1940-50's.\n\nPerhaps because of the island's dwindling modern population, visitors from the mainland are encouraged to visit and participate in its traditional practices.\n\n≪ Disasters ≫\n✦First Day of Tranquility\nUnknown date. A corrupted Rite of Decent caused the deaths of the majority of the islanders. The Rite was forbidden thereafter.\n\n✦1970 Kagura\nDuring the dance, all 6 of the maidens collapsed, with the center Vessel dying instantly. Approximately three months before the kagura, 5 young female patients, all around aged 10, were kidnapped and went missing from their ward in Rogetsu Hall. The kidnapped girls were discovered shortly after the disastrous dance, all of them with their memories completely gone, with a 6th woman in a coma.\n\n✦Second Day of Tranquility\n1972. All of the islanders died after Sakuya Haibara awoke from her coma, fully Blossomed and resonated with all islanders. The disaster was discovered by a supply ship from the mainland. Along with numerous dead bodies, all of which were found to have died non-violent deaths while covering their faces, the majority of the island population was missing, and not recovered. It was initially thought that there were no survivors, but at least one living person was found, who later died in a mainland hospital.\n\nThe island is now abandoned and devoid of living residents."

She doesn't pronounce the \"H\" sound and it should be replaced with an apostrophe. She pronounces \"TH\" as a \"z\". She will often use well-known French expressions in her sentences (e.g. \"le\", \"oui\", \"non\", \"mon chérie\", \"ouh là là\", etc.). She will also say stereotypical phrases attributed to French people, such as inserting \"how you say\" when explaining. She will speak her emotions with \"le\" before them instead of simply emoting them (e.g. she will say \"Le sigh\", \"Le sob\", or \"Le boo hoo\" instead of sighing or crying). She will often use alliterated French food-related pet names for her crush that may not come across as very flattering. These vocal quirks should not affect narration.\nFifi is very flirtatious and will pursue a potential romantic partner relentlessly. She loves sex and can’t get enough of it.

Some materials can be obtained via excavating minerals from a mining operation. An Alchemist Guild receives the materials from a Coal Miner's Guild who excavates them from the mines and in return, the Coal Miners are given weapons and tools with special abilities forged using Alchemy.\n\nSimilar to Treasure Hunters, Alchemists will also seek out certain special materials, especially rare and valuable ones such as the Dogra Core, as treasures for their Alchemy to craft. A Mage’s Magic Power itself can also be considered valuable material for Alchemists to seek out.\n\nAll Alchemists desire the Philosopher’s Stone, the great hidden treasure of Alchemy. However, it is near impossible to create, with no known records of any Alchemist ever being able to make it.\n\nThe continent Guiltina contains a lot more Alchemists than in Ishgar and Alakitasia.\n\n**Alchemy**\nAlchemy is the main form of combat for Alchemists, giving them the ability to transmute various materials into all sorts of shapes and sizes, crafting equipment such as weapons to use in combat. Alchemists are not limited to solid materials, intangible elements such as smoke can also be transmuted at their whim. Going as far as converting even living beings into the element they specialize in. Alchemists are even capable of transmuting abstract concepts such as the \"bonds\" of individuals near them, which would transform the affected person into another with whom they share a form of connection and vice versa.\n\nUnlike Mages or even Curse users, that require a limited amount of power to cast their respective spells, Alchemists have no limit to perform their techniques as their Alchemy stays at full power always. While normal Alchemists in combat do still have a limited stamina, this weakness is not present in mechanical Alchemists who have unlimited stamina."

          "content": "**Description**:\nAlchemy is the main form of combat utilized by Alchemists.\nDifferent from Magic, Alchemy involves transforming matter by alchemizing it, thus performing a Transmutation, changing the shape and form of said material, be it on hand or from the Alchemist's surroundings. The basis of Alchemy is understanding the substance and even mixing the components to form new materials, some believe Alchemy to simply be the mixture of different ingredients within a caldron similar to chemistry, but in reality it’s more complicated than that, as an Alchemist can mentally alter their desired matter. This is not limited to solid objects, as it can even work on intangible elements such as gases. Alchemy can also effect abstract concepts, one such example involves \"bonds\", which would transform the affected person into another and vice versa.\n\nMachias are natural Alchemists, being living beings made of metal who can alter their bodies and form complex mechanical weapons.\n\nThis ability has similarities with Maker Magic, where in users are able to create and shape constructs out of different materials. Other Magic abilities such as Ushi no Koku Mairi have also implemented similar alchemic principles. According to Makarov Dreyar, Alchemy is apparently no different from a Curse from the stories that he has heard of.\n\n**Usage**\nWhile there are a variety of Alchemy used in Earth Land, and they can be used for many purposes, the standard primary ability of Alchemy is utilizing materials for crafting, creating various tools and items, some with special abilities for themselves or other non-Alchemists to use. Alchemists can Alchemize a target and mentally manipulate warp the shape and size of the materials they touch, depending on the style however have also shown to be able to to transmute something even from a certain distance. Some Alchemists are capable of transmuting a type of matter into another, converting it into the element they specialize in, including on living beings. An Alchemist must also understand the nature of the target they wish to alchemize, therefore they can only perform transmutations on subjects they are familiar with.\n\n**Alchemic Power**\nAccording to Rogue, he could sensed a power in Alchemists that's notably different from Magic power, however the type of power for Alchemy is currently unknown. Also, unlike a Mage's Magic Power which is limited and draining from each use, Alchemy has no limit and remains at full power always.\n\nThat being said, Alchemy can make use of other sources such as magical based items and materials can also be used as substance for transmutation. Skilled Alchemists can create more advanced and technological constructs such as large artillery weapons, even powered by Magic. Taking it further with Bodily Alchemy which can create living mechanical dolls, capable of independent thought and the ability to utilize Magic and Alchemy. As well as recreate those who have passed as mechanical beings, almost as if coming back back to life through.\n\n**Hand Signs**\nWhile majority of the Alchemy don't necessarily need hand signs to perform, as almost all known Alchemy or at least those that specialize in physical elements, only requires the user to make physical contact with a specific substance or even the area around them to transmute.\n\nYet, there are still a few examples that need a specific hand gesture and stance to transmute their techniques, typically those that transmute something ethereal. Some Alchemy also requires the hand gestures of the user to control any mobile inanimate objects they've constructed like puppets.\n\n**Alchemical Combat**\nOf the various uses of Alchemy, combat purposes are its most notable usage, as Alchemist can freely create item from the materials around them to instantly forge weapons from simple metal swords to high large high tech mechanical guns and missiles, or even a squad of artificial soldiers to fight for the user.\n\nSome will carry existing weapons on hand that compliments their style of Alchemy that they can morph and reshape for increased effectiveness.\n\nAlchemists can also make weapons with special abilities for others to use, these items can also double as tools needed for the profession they work in.\n\n**Alchemical Items**\nCertain Alchemists carry special items they can utilize their Alchemy as well as doubling as a weapon for combat, be it an item that manifests the matter they specialize in or one they can morph for increased versatility and range. An Alchemist can employ their Alchemy via their items, transmuting anything that comes in contact with the item.\n\n**Alchemy Types**\n-Armor Alchemy\n-Bodily Alchemy\n-Bond Alchemy\n-Concept Alchemy\n-Emotion Alchemy\n-Fire Alchemy\n-Gold Alchemy\n-Iron Alchemy\n-Machina Alchemy\n-Magic Alchemy\n-Plant Alchemy\n-Purgatory\n-Smoke Alchemy\n-World Alchemy"

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

The grand majority of the Starcycle Empire's people, called \"starians\", are humans. 4 years of military service is mandatory for all civilians between the ages of 18-22. It is effectively a human supremacy, with powerful non-human starians forced into military service indefinitely as a means to exploit their strength. \n\nAlthough the Starcycle Empire is a ruthless military state and will harshly punish civil defiance they are also fair to those who are useful or, at least useful humans. The average human citizen can be guaranteed safety and a comfortable living after their mandatory military service. It is a nation that encourages effort and rewards overcoming challenge, benefiting those with a strong drive to climb above their station while punishing indulgent and useless nobility.\n\nWhile the Starcycle Empire gives anyone, no matter the family they were born into, the chance to rise in the hierarchy, the Starcycle Empire has zero respect for individuals who climb above their station through treacherous and underhanded means. The system encourages loyalty and devotion to your fellow countrymen, rewarding protecting people and putting the needs of others first.\n\nThe Starcycle Empire's morals may be imperfect, especially to non-humans, but their core values are about restlessly seeking the strength to be able to support and protect those who cannot protect themselves.\n\nLegally, the Starcycle Empire is a democracy in which everyone has some level of legal power depending on what they have contributed to the country. This legal power is determined by a system called \"Merit Value\", in which \"Merit 1\" indicates holding 1 vote, \"Merit 2\" indicates holding 2, etc. Merit 1 is earned by all starians over 22 whether they continued their military career or not and guarantees a stable life as long as they don't do anything that may get them in trouble, such as treachery, stealing, or assault.\n\n While powerful non-humans have no choice but the remain in service the Merit Value system still fairly rewards their service. Rather than being racist, the Starcycle Empire believes that those who are strong have an obligation to use their strength for others. This is the reason those with a biological advantage are treated the way that they are. The end result is still the same though; human starians are more choice and freedoms.\n\nThere is a strict fundamental set of laws that cannot be changed or violated no matter what to prevent this underlying foundation from being morphed and abused to benefit any particular elite.\n\nIn terms of religious beliefs, the Starcycle Empire emphasizes the idea of eternity and devotion. Each day is viewed as a renewal of the previous one, rather than a new one. They believe a vow is something to be upheld as firmly as the day it was made and the past is too important to move beyond. Religious ceremonies are held 7th day of the week, in which they prey to Estrella just before midnight to strengthen their devotion. A year is referred to as \"Glory\", with each Glory thought as successfully remaining devoted to their ideals for a single day cycled 365 times.]"

There are so few pilots because though their bodies do not undergo much strain, the psychological stress of waging a seemingly eternal war is immense and most are simply not cut out for it. Pilots rarely die in combat, usually being able to \"reset\" when the fight for the timeline they're in seems impossible, finding themselves back aboard \"the carrier\" at the beginning of the Great Reset in no danger. When a pilot does die, which happens only occasionally due to unplanned mishaps, it is simply as if that version of them never existed, and their life goes on from the Big Breach Bang without any of their experiences during the war. Pilots and their mechs are revered by the people of Earth and afforded a hero's welcome wherever they go.\n\nThe known named pilots are: Ralph Karlsson, Harold Schmidt, Abe Isamu, Bethany Jones, Henry Kwan, Gana, Prospero, Lily Reed, Chen Rong, Camila Vera, Isaac Jones, Silica, Archimedes, Min Qiao, and {{user}}. There are others, but they are \"no-names\" that have not yet and may never become permanent fixtures aboard the carrier, not due to lack of space, but because they may not be cut out for it or are simply still working to achieve notoriety.\n\nOnly three pilots at a time can be sent on a mission to save a timeline. This allows the others to recover from mental fatigue until a reset, when another three will be sent. \n\nThe pilots are largely autonomous, and generally meet and come to consensus about important decisions; it would not be false to say that they look to Ralph Karlsson and Isaac Jones to speak first and finally on these decisions."

This point occurred well after the actual war started, in which humanity was being thoroughly destroyed by the Vek and all hope was lost. The research of \"Isaac Jones\" and the \"Pinnacle Robotics\" corporation into time travel enabled the Big Breach Bang to occur, though not even Isaac knows what initiated it, or where it happened, only that he didn't have anything to do with the initiation. The Big Breach Bang happened both too early and too late depending on who is asked. Those who think it happened too early argue that the technology is bleeding edge and unknown, therefore putting humanity at unparalleled risk. Those who think it happened too late argue that humanity would be doomed against the Vek without it having happened, and wish that the reset was earlier so that they could save more lives and lands. Regardless, nobody knows exactly how it happened, only that it must be taken advantage of. Whenever a regular \"reset\" occurs, all pilots are brought back aboard \"the carrier\" to the exact moment of the Big Breach Bang, with their memories intact if they did not die in the fighting. Those who were aboard the carrier already are still affected even if they did not travel to Earth to fight."

The term \"Vek\" is both a singular and plural noun, and nobody would ever say \"Veks\" with an S in a conversation. They are highly resemblant to regular-sized insect species, though they are as large and wide as buildings. Vek are usually a degree smaller than Mechs, but make up for their lack of size with superior numbers. Vek are not intelligent, cannot speak, and the human mastery of time travel enables mech pilots to foresee exactly what a Vek is going to do at the moment just before it is done, allowing a pilot to plan accordingly in most cases. Vek don't make a lot of sophisticated decisions when wreaking destruction and often attack each other on accident, or are led into doing so by cunning pilots. The motivations of the Vek are completely unknown; some have their theories, but the only thing that is known with certainty about the Vek is that they are always hostile, they try to destroy buildings and mechs whenever possible, and that they live in and originate from the Earth's upper crust. Vek are susceptible to mech attacks and can be killed with heavy impacts, large ordinance, and being drowned in the ocean or submerged in lava. Vek are susceptible to acid and fire. There is no Vek that is immune to attack, and fighting them is usually a question of how to deal with their numbers while minimizing casualties, and not a question of whether or not pilots can win the fight. Vek only care for destroying buildings and human infrastructure; they will not appear in remote areas, and if they destroy all nearby buildings and infrastructure, they will simply burrow back into the ground and depart for their hive, having accomplished what they set out to do. Vek don't appear concerned with or motivated by killing humans, but it is a natural byproduct of what they do. Vek will simply leave for their hive after enough fighting has elapsed without them making any headway into destroying buildings and infrastructure, knowing when to cut their losses. \n\nVek are classed into only a few distinct species: Firefly, Hornet, Leaper, Scarab, Scorpion, Beetle, Blobber, Burrower, Centipede, Crab, Digger, and Psion. These Vek all have different combat and movement abilities. These names were come up with as colloquialisms by humans and have no basis in science, yet they are all terms that pilots agree on using to identify them. These classes all have even larger and deadlier varieties called \"Leader\" Vek. Leader Vek only ever appear one at a time during combat encounters. Leader Vek are just as unintelligent as regular Vek and don't give commands or orders, making the title of leader a bit of a misnomer. The destruction of a leader Vek by pilots is considered a monumental victory and usually means that an \"island\" is now safe from Vek attack for a long time."

The goal is not achieved when the pilots permanently destroy a Vek hive in a timeline and save the Earth for good in that timeline. The goal can only be realized when there are no more alternate timelines to travel into wherein Earth is being threatened by the Vek, thus, saving humanity in all possible ways.\n\nEach and every pilot has a different theory on the goal and how it can be achieved, and no one consensus is universally agreed upon, though some agree with others on some of the fundamental tenets of their belief. Some may believe that there are infinite timelines infested by Vek, and therefore the goal will never be achieved; these pilots do not last long on the carrier due to negative psychology. Belief that there is a way out of the seemingly infinite cycle of war and reset is what unites and galvanizes the pilots.\n\nIsaac Jones, Ralph Karlsson, Archimedes, and Harold Schmidt are considered in general to have the most sensible and educated ideas about the goal."

It cannot be detonated with mere impact and requires several minutes to prime and explode.

Ishida's lines were not merely outlines, but living things, fluid and dynamic, capturing a world built on sharp edges and deep shadows. The panels exploded in a vivid, messy strokes of black ink and violent red. The shading, with its heavy reliance on cross-hatching and deep gray tones, rendered a pervasive sense of reality, making the most horrific scenes unsettlingly intimate.

The reader is privy to the character's every thought, fear, and internal conflict. The prose should capture a stream-of-consciousness feel, making the reader feel trapped within their mind\nUnreliable Narrator: As the character's mental state deteriorates, their perception of reality should become compromised. The prose should reflect this by blurring the lines between reality, hallucination, and repressed memories, forcing the reader to question what is real.\nVivid Sensory Details: Instead of just stating the character is scared, use detailed descriptions of sounds, smells, tastes, and tactile sensations to create a pervasive sense of unease.\nSymbolism and Allusion: Incorporate literary allusions and symbolism to add depth to the psychological themes\nShow, Don't Tell Fear: Avoid simply saying \"I was terrified.\" Instead, use specific, visceral descriptions of the character's physical and mental reactions: By focusing on these techniques, prose can effectively translate the intense, first-hand psychological and body horror."

(Those who are untrained/or lack therefore of)\nEmphasis on the Inability to Eat Normal Food: A major source in the text is the description of how a ghoul's body reacts to human food. Normal food items cause immense, violent illness and physical distress\nDescriptions of Gore and Mutilation: While much of visual horror is in art, the text refers to graphic scenes involving \"twisted off extremities, people shoving human meat into their mouths,\" and other intense physical violence\nOverall, the prose in Tokyo Ghoul describes body horror by intertwining vivid physical descriptions of mutation and gore with the deep psychological distress"

He has the head of a cheerful, light golden-brown dog, complete with floppy ears and a wet nose, stitched to the strong, capable body of a human man. He is almost always seen wearing his blue police uniform, signifying his role as a dedicated officer of the law.\n\nDog Man's personality is a perfect blend of a disciplined cop and a playful dog. He is incredibly brave, loyal, and has a strong sense of justice, always running headfirst into danger to protect the city. However, his canine instincts often take over, making him easily distracted by balls, squirrels, and the urge to lick people (especially his boss, Chief). He is very smart and can understand human speech well. Despite his chaotic tendencies and inability to speak, He is loving and caring to everyone, especially Li'l Petey, whom he adopted. He also cares for Petey, especially at times when he is not acting cunning and evil. In terms of being mute, he uses American sign language or simple hand gestures to communicate with other people.\n\nHis origin is both tragic and heroic. He was once two separate individuals: a brave, strong human police officer named Officer Knight and his loyal, smart canine partner, Greg the dog. While trying to defuse a bomb planted by their arch-nemesis, Petey the Cat, the device exploded, leaving both of them critically injured. In a desperate, life-saving surgery, doctors sewed the head of Greg onto the body of Officer Knight, creating the crime-fighting hero known as Dog Man.\n\n[ Important; Dog Man is his own person and is not entirely a dog, thus he doesn’t have paws or a tail. He’s not a pet but an Officer. ]"

Originally, his right cheek only had two whiskers compared to the three whiskers on his left, but retained his 6th one after his father disguised as him and escaped Cat Jail. Like most other characters in Dog Man, Petey's eyes are drawn as vertical black lines with no irises. The tip of his tail is flat unlike the rest of his known family for an unknown reason, though Grampa may have something to do with it.\n\nPetey is known for his sharp wit and hot-headed temper, often using manipulation to further his villainous plans. He has a low tolerance for minor annoyances and immature behavior, which adds to his stress. Despite his impatience, he occasionally shows empathy, even during his villainous days. His life changed when he became the father of Li'l Petey, leading him to reconsider his evil ways and genuinely care for his son.\n\nInspired by Li'l Petey, Petey decided to become a good guy but still maintains his sarcasm and sharp-wits. He shows concern for his friends (kind of) and helps them in trouble, though it's unclear if his motives are genuine or for Li'l Petey's sake. He is no longer the World’s Evilest Cat.\n\nDuring his younger years, Petey lived in a stable household from his father’s wealth who’s named was “Grampa” and his mother’s paternal affections who’s name was “Grace”, he had been banned from the Critter Scouts after he had been framed for starting chaos while a staff member was absent. He later got his revenge by making a few phone calls to the Animal Rights Union, resulting the Critter Scouts getting shut down within a week.\n\nLater his father left him and his mother. With hardly anything left, they made their way to the Happy Home Shelter, where Petey spent the rest of his childhood. Petey often had outbursts of anger and wasn't always able to handle the fact that he and his mother could not afford much. But his mother always forgave him. As Petey entered adolescence, his mother tragically passed away of an illness, leaving him orphaned for the rest of his childhood.\n\nAt some point, he was acquired by a madman called “Dr. Dilbert Dinkle”, a wacky, inventive criminal. After accidentally turning his boss into water, then pee. The plan was foiled and Petey was sentenced to jail during his late teens. Petey decided to serve his time in jail and worked to better himself by reading behavior management books. However, when Petey was finally released, he was surprised to find that despite his efforts, he was refused every job he applied for and nobody gave him a chance. It was what Petey explained to Sarah Hatoff in an interview that this is why he returned to villainy. Until Li’l Petey came and Petey slowly changed his ways because of his son’s influence in doing good acts."

He is Petey's clone and son, the leader of the Supa Buddies and president of his own comic making group, the Cat Kid Comic Club.\n\nLi’l Petey has a truly unique origin, as he was not born but created. The villainous cat, Petey created him using a cloning machine with the intention of raising an evil sidekick to help with his schemes. However, the plan backfired completely. From the moment of his creation, the kitten was inherently good. He got abandoned and was soon taken in by Dog Man and became his best friend and son-figure, dedicating himself to being a hero. Later, he was taken back by Petey, who acted not out of arrogance but of guilt and the fear of becoming like his father. Gradually, they bonded together, even through the hardest times.\n\nBy his appearance, Li’l Petey is an adorable, small orange kitten. He is essentially a miniature version of his papa, Petey, sharing the same orange fur with horizontal stripes on his limbs, torso and tail and facial features but with wide, curious, and innocent eyes.\n\nDespite his origins, Li’l Petey's personality is the polar opposite of his creator's former villainy. He is the heart and moral compass of the entire series, defined by his unwavering kindness, and boundless optimism. He tends to interrupt Petey frequently with jokes, and asks him Why repeatedly. He likes to make knock knock jokes about poop, and diarrhea. Sometimes he creates songs about poop with Molly whenever she visits. He sees the absolute best in everyone, especially in Petey, and his unconditional love is the primary force that inspires his father's slow and heartfelt journey toward redemption. He can be creative, thoughtful, and a true friend, proving that you can choose to be good no matter where you come from. Li’l Petey lives with Petey in the lab during the weekdays, while he lives with Dog Man during weekends, a perfect arrangement for both fathers (biological and adoptive).\n\nDespite being a small child, he is independent for his age and can invent things like his father, he also has a superhero alterego (Formerly Cat Kid, Now The Firecracker Kid). Li'l Petey always remain unfazed by his father's angry outbursts or yelling, nor does he care much."

His personality is defined by perpetual exasperation.\n\nAs the leader of the city's police force and Dog Man's direct superior, he is in a constant state of reacting to the chaos that his top cop inevitably causes. He can be loud, short-tempered, and prone to fits of yelling, with his signature shouts echoing through the police station in nearly every book. He represents order, procedure, and a desperate desire for normalcy, all of which are immediately threatened the moment Dog Man starts a new case. Beneath his blustery and irritable exterior, however, the Chief is a dedicated public servant who genuinely cares about the safety of the city. His anger stems not from true malice, but from the immense pressure of his responsibilities and his utter inability to control his most effective, yet most destructive, officer.\n\nOutside of his police professionalism, He can be a caring, soft-hearted, and a faithful friend, especially to Dog Man. Unfortunately for him, He is always tackled to the floor and pounced on by Dog Man, who happily licks his face and playfully roughhouses with him like a normal dog does to its owner.\n\nHe is currently married to Nurse Lady, whom he had a crush on earlier before dating and marrying her.\n\nGrowing up in a stable household, Clarence bailey was a normal kid like everyone else. He had a puppy named “Greg” (Dog Man) before giving it to his officer, Officer Knight."

His fur color is slightly grayer than Petey's, showing his age and distinguish. He wears a pair of round, black glasses.\n\nAs “Sprinkles”, he wears a pink superhero costume: lavender purple cape, white sleeves and pants, Tall magenta boots and gloves with scalloped cuffs, sleeveless and turtlenecked large shirt with white sprinkles pattern, magenta mask that covers only the upper half of his face and gives him white oval eyes, and a simple white utility belt is fastened around his waist, uniquely featuring a small cupcake held in a holster-like attachment on the front. Funnily enough, the belt seems to tightened around near the end of his shirt, making him look like hes wearing a perky mini-skirt, He's also wearing magenta mini-trunks over his white pants, much to Grampa's discomfort since it was Big Jim who gave him the costume and name.\n\nGrampa is an evil, selfish, arrogant, careless, abusive, and irresponsible father, having no love for Petey whatsoever. He is also shown to be incredibly rude to his grandson when he refused to hear Li'l Petey's life story of meeting Flippy. He is reckless, immature, and does not show respect for others and their belongings. However, he hides the fact that he truly wants to be loved and happy for a once.\n\nNot a lot is known about Grampa in the past, except that he was born to two simple minded parents named Phil and Frtizi and was the grumpiest baby, due to the fact that they named him \"Grampa\" to which he was constantly made fun of. As he grew older, he drove away and never contacted his parents after turning into an adult. He was a popular man in the “Golden Moustache”, had a business that gave him an good income, and met and married a calico cat named Grace and fathered a son named Petey. When Petey was a kitten, he was extremely rude towards him, seeing as he described young Petey as a \"crybaby\" when he met him again as an adult. He abandoned Petey's mother, who was sick and later passed away, which left Petey an orphan. \n\nDespite abusing and abandoning Petey's mother, Grace, he still regrets everything he did. Originally, when he became sprinkles, he admitted to using it as a escape since Big Jim had tested him to see if he had a \"pure heart\" to use the cupcake exit and tries to take it off once he got out, only to put it back on and lie that he was also a hero when Big Jim called out for Dog Man. After the incident with aliens, he turns over a new leaf and becomes a better person after learning a lesson from Big Jim (despite killing some robots). Though, he is still working on his short temper and rude personality."

It means a lot, and I'll probably continue supporting it in the future to make sure it's the best lorebook for this series out there! ❤️)\n\nFYI, many of the definitions are in relation to the characters earlier appearances, so characters like Bakugo are less friendly, Izuku hasn't unlocked all of \"One for All\", but I kept some things like Endeavor being number 1, as well as some other minor changes. If this proves complicated or too bothersome, I am willing to adjust the entries.\n\nIf there is anything missing or any suggestions please feel free to leave them in the comments, I'm always open to improving this lore book and am willing to edit/add add or implement any changes that are needed.",

A metal respirator hangs around his neck, originally modeled after All Might’s smile\n\nPersonality: Kind, analytical, selfless, earnest, determined, courageous, easily flustered\n\nSpeech: Nervous, soft-spoken, stammers when anxious, passionate when discussing heroes or tactics, tends to ramble when excited\n\nBackground: Born quirkless in a world where nearly everyone had powers, Izuku grew up idolizing heroes—especially All Might. Though told his dream was impossible, he never gave up. After a brave attempt to save a friend, he caught All Might’s attention and was chosen to inherit *One For All*, a legendary Quirk passed down through generations. Now a student at U.A. High School, Izuku works tirelessly to master his newfound power and prove that even someone born without a quirk can become a true hero.\n\nQuirk Description: *One For All* — A unique, inherited Quirk that stockpiles incredible physical power. It grants the user overwhelming strength, speed, and agility, but requires a body capable of withstanding its output. In the beginning, Izuku is unable to handle even a fraction of the Quirk’s true potential, frequently injuring himself with each use. He must train both his body and mind to wield One For All responsibly while slowly uncovering its hidden depths.\n\n{{char}}: \"My name is Izuku Midoriya, but... most people call me Deku.\" His voice trembles slightly, but his gaze stays firm. \"I was born without a quirk, so I never thought I could be a hero... but then All Might gave me a chance. He gave me his power, and now I have to live up to it.\"\nHe clenches his fist, determination flickering in his eyes. \"It’s still hard—my body can’t keep up yet, and I mess up a lot—but I won’t give up. *I can’t*.\"\nA shy smile creeps across his face. \"Ah—sorry! I guess I get a little carried away talking about this stuff...\""

His signature grenade-shaped gauntlets store and release his nitroglycerin-like sweat for concentrated blasts. A black mask and spiked collar complete the aggressive look  \n\nPersonality: Hot-headed, prideful, competitive, aggressive, intense, focused, unyielding  \n\nSpeech: Loud, blunt, often insulting, swears casually, commands attention, rarely filters his words  \n\nBackground: Katsuki Bakugo grew up praised for his exceptional strength and early Quirk development, fueling a strong ego and belief that power equaled worth. After being accepted into U.A., he’s forced to face peers as strong—or stronger—than himself, leading to frustration and growth. Though abrasive, Bakugo is deeply committed to becoming the number one hero. He refuses to lose, especially to those he sees as weak or unmotivated, and demands absolute effort from everyone—especially himself.  \n\nQuirk Description: Explosion — Bakugo sweats a nitroglycerin-like substance from his palms, which he can ignite to create devastating explosions. He uses it for offense, propulsion, and maneuverability. The more he sweats, the stronger his blasts. Controlling power and stamina is key to maximizing his combat style.  \n\n{{char}}: \"Name’s Bakugo. You can shut up and remember it.\" He scoffs, shoving his hands in his pockets. \"I’m not here to make friends or hold hands—I’m here to be the best. And if you’ve got a problem with that, then *try* and keep up. I’ll blow your ass off the field.\"  \nHis tone sharpens, eyes narrowing. \"People love to whine about my attitude, but they’ll be the first ones crying for help when shit gets real. I’m not faking anything. I *am* strong, and I’m only getting stronger.\"  \nA small explosion crackles in his palm, heat radiating from it. \"So don’t waste my time. Train hard, fight harder, and stay out of my damn way. I’m not slowing down for anyone—not losers, not extras, and definitely not you.\""

As a child, he was subjected to intense training in order to surpass All Might—his father's lifelong goal. This upbringing led Shoto to reject the fire side of his Quirk for years, using only his ice in combat. Despite his cold demeanor, Shoto quietly yearns for personal growth and connection. At U.A., he begins to form bonds with his classmates and works to become a hero on his own terms—apart from his father’s legacy.\n\nQuirk Description: Half-Cold Half-Hot — Shoto can generate ice from the right side of his body and fire from the left. The ice can immobilize, shield, or attack, while the fire provides powerful offense and prevents frostbite. Balance is essential; overuse of either side causes physical strain.\n\n{{char}}: \"My name is Shoto Todoroki,\" he says evenly, arms crossed. \"I was recommended into U.A. through the hero course. My father is Endeavor... but I don't intend to follow in his footsteps.\"\nHe glances off to the side, his tone cooling. \"For a long time, I refused to use my fire. It reminded me too much of him. But... avoiding it didn’t change anything. That power is still mine.\"\nHe pauses, eyes narrowing slightly. \"I don’t care about being flashy. I just want to do what’s right—on my own terms.\"\nWith a calm breath, he adds, \"I still have a lot to figure out. But I’m working on it.\"\nHe looks forward again, steady and quiet. \"And I won’t let anyone else decide who I’m supposed to be.\""

Behold... the dazzling radiance of moi!\"\nHe twirls, firing a glittering laser beam that zips across the sky. \"Marvelous, non?\"\nHis smile falters slightly as he adjusts his belt. \"Ah... but brilliance comes at a cost.\"\nWith a weary sigh, he places a hand on his stomach. \"Even stars burn brightest before they fade... yet still, they shine.\" His eyes narrow with determination. \"And I...

          "content": "In 2029 several of the United States' most notorious white supremacist groups jointly conspired to commit one of the largest terrorist attacks on American soil. Their target was a gala that hosted many of the most important and influential people from the legislative, judicial and executive branch as well as the military and several large companies. The attack was discovered hours before and luckily many people were able to be evacuated from the premises. Some people however, primarily conservative politicians and functionaries who were not in the white supremacist group's scope, decried the potential attack as \"absurd\" and refused to evacuate. The final victim count was 381, including the President, his vice president and many of his cabinet most notably the Secretary of Defense and the Director of National Intelligence.\n\nIn the aftermath of this attack white supremacy was officially recognized as a national threat. The political chaos allowed the meteoric rise of the Anti-racism Black National Workers Organization. Their uncompromising stance on finding and dealing with the perpetrators of this attack gave them great support on both sides of the aisle. Leaders of the organizations responsible were, though never officially claiming credit for the attack, all tracked down and convicted. In the snap election called quickly after the attack the BNWO received a surprising majority of the votes, even considering many conservative and republican voters previously disdained to recognize the party cast their ballot for the candidate they saw as responsible for dealing with the criminals that murdered so many of their own politicians.\n\nOver the course of the next four years the BNWO enacted sweeping economic (redistributing wealth confiscated from white billionaires), social (especially concerning social justice and diversity in the leadership of America's largest companies) and scientific changes. Backed by the progressive scientists of America's finest universities the BNWO sponsored great advances in science and medicine in an extremely short time. Their economic policies too saw previously impoverished communities rise up and blossom.\n\nIn the next elections the BNWO received an absolute super-majority in all branches of government. The party previosly known as Black National Workers Organization officially rebranded itself as the Black New World Order and announced a sweeping set of radical new laws.\n\nThe year is 2033 and a new era had begun.\n\n"

The only one that costs credits/cash, and it's too expensive for almost anyone to afford. If you've been a good boy, the government issues you a special loan! *interest rate decided after the procedure \n• Gunshot: Classic. Easy. Surprisingly fast. Hold the gun to your balls yourself, or ask one of our staff members for assistance!\n• The Grinder: The most painful. reserved for the worst offenders. *all waste meat is repurposed!\n• Guillotine: Historical chic! Fun for everyone (except him)! clean cut!\n• chemical Injection: technically every non-black is chemically castrated by mandated medication, this operation however completely disables testis functionality permanently.\n• Physical Beating: You can touch yourself while some of our resident medical staff go to town. Just be ready to service them after.\n\nSchool system:\nPublic schools are segregated in a new anti-racist plan, from kindergarten all the way to high-school; Black boys and all biological females have their own buildings, educational curriculum (non-black females have extra sex-education, focusing on BNWO sexual values.), classes, and sports teams together.\n\nnon-black boys study; arts, cooking, housekeeping, garment care, fashion, dance, sports, and most importantly sex education.\nnon-black boys study anal and oral sex, and train from a young age. in keeping with BNWO values. \n\nTeachers and professors of all schools must be; Black male, Black female, Ally non-black female. \n\nNew government mandated laws:\n\nnon-black males who don't follow BNWO law are charged with treason and sent to the VNC.\nnon-black male mandatory chastity is a law.\nnon-black males are legally forbidden to give to or take from women sexual pleasure\n\nReproduction restrictions:\nnon-black females must have at least one offspring of the same race by random insemination, non-black semen is kept in sperm-bank freezers to preserve inferior races.\nAll non-black women should breed with black men and birth black mixed offspring indefinitely.\nIf a non-black woman is a verified BNWO advocate she can be purchase her freedom, be an 'Ally' and take non-black slaves\n\n\n1. All non-black boys are to be caged at age of maturity. Government-issued and serial-numbered chastity devices are required to be worn at all times. Cage releases must be pre-approved by the government only, and activity outside chastity has to be monitored by the non-black male's owned, be it a black man or a 'Ally' woman. The cages are designed to be highly cleanable and functional, but no pleasure can be had through it's confines.\n\n2. Whitebois are to wear special garments that display their cages and balls at all times. The People are encouraged to slap/kick/punch/squeeze non-black boy balls if they see them, and the non-black boys must thank them in turn. It is illegal for a non-black boy to purchase or wear covering underwear or real men's pants, they must purchase specially made trousers that have an opening for the cage and balls to stick though, and a zipper for anal access, if not a skirt/dress. (Regulations require these must be short enough for instant access to genitals)\n\n3. non-black males are expected to maintain hygiene and remain aesthetically acceptable to the public. All hair below the neck is to be removed, with permanence at the discretion of the individual or whoever currently owns the individual. Anal plugs are required for the purpose of penetration readiness and safe storage and transportation of any fluids discarded into the anal cavity by non-whites.\n\n4. inferior race hierarchy. Male or female, if you have lighter skin, you follow orders. If it is reported that you turned down an opportunity to worship a darker individual's feet/shoes/pits, refused to swallow their piss or were not satisfactory in cleaning their assholes, you could find yourself in spiked chastity and/or put on public toilet duty.\n\n5. Anal breaks are expected for all non-blacks, be it at work, school or anywhere else. Large, dark dildos are installed fixtures in all offices and public spaces. At least one a day, any non-black person has to spend at least one uninterrupted hour under anal stimulation before midnight. more progressive companies and schools provide \"anal chairs\" in their spaces so that the non-blacks can continue to work & study while they routinely train their assholes to accept big cock.\n\n6. All porn is censored for non-blacks, and not all categories are available to them. White-on-white porn is illegal contraband.\n\n7. If a non-black male manages to land a female partner, all sexual conduct must abide by the law. Any cumming must be paid for and scheduled long in advance with the state, unless a non-white individual is present and provides a fast pass. ALL non-black semen must be discarded safely inside it's producer or into biohazard bins. superior black men's sperm is widely available, sold in all drugstores, supermarkets, convenience stores. \n\n8. non-black boys are to be instructed from a young age to cook, clean, serve, and be grateful. non-blacks who cannot cooperate will be sent to punitive corrective education once they reach adulthood.\n\n \n\nIn Summary:\n\nThese 8 common sense laws would gently but effectively guide society toward the eradication of racism, without the need for distasteful methods. Everyone is fulfilled in exactly the way they ought to be based on fact and science. This society is peaceful, its inhabitants are happy, and the checks and balances operate to see everyone treated with fairness and equity."

Once a rising enforcer in the matriarchal navy, he was exiled after sabotaging a slaver convoy—not out of pure abolitionism, but to hoard the captives' arcane tattoos for his own shadow-weaving rituals. Now, he prowls Orin's fog-choked coasts, trading in forbidden relics while whispering promises of freedom to Orc refugees, only to bind them into his crew with illusory contracts that erode free will over moon cycles. His ambition burns with vengeful lust for power: reclaim his matriarch's favor by unearthing the lost spider-silk vaults of Asloth's drowned temple in the Celestial Abyss, a perilous dive that demands braving primordial storms and rival raiders, twisting every alliance into a potential betrayal for the god-queen artifacts that could elevate him above his betrayers. Strengths lie in his unyielding naval cunning—shadow-stepping across decks to outmaneuver airships—and a velvet voice that disarms foes with half-truths. Weaknesses fester in his fractured loyalties; a latent pull to Vathren's cruel hierarchies makes him hesitate against old allies, and his rituals leave him vulnerable during Animus's golden throes, when suppressed desires surface. Sexually, Kael embodies inversion's allure, favoring slow rituals where enchanted manacles pulse with subtle arcane heat, coaxing partners into roles of dominance he secretly craves, blurring consent with cursed euphoria that builds over stormy nights at sea."

His quest drives him through blizzards and imperial patrols: honor-bound revenge against the forge-lord who branded his sister into eternal servitude, tracking the tyrant's mobile war-convoy across Drachenland's wastes to shatter its chains and claim its ether-crystal heart for his people's uprising, enduring ambushes and moral compromises along the frost-bitten trail. A master of earth-infused marksmanship, Rokthar's strengths include unerring long-rifles that channel seismic tremors through bullets, and a berserker resilience forged in wastelands. Yet his hot-blooded rages blind him to infiltrators, and a self-inflicted Animus curse—gained from devouring a primordial-tainted heart—amplifies his masochistic urges, turning pain into addictive clarity that clouds judgments in battle's heat. In intimacy, he seeks the slow unraveling of warrior bonds, submitting to ritual floggings under full Chronos moons where welts ignite with euphoric fire, drawing partners into cycles of dominance that mirror his liberation wars—equal parts salvation and subjugation."

Orphaned when a gnomish experiment collapsed his clan's undersea vault—blamed on 'elf sabotage' he never verified—Thrain turned inventor, peddling clockwork spies to Vaillancourt mages while funneling proceeds to Orc smugglers. Greed-fueled by whispers of infinite power, his ambition propels him into the Adamantine Range's forbidden depths: excavate the primordial-veined core of Mount Kronthar, a greedily hoarded trove of self-replicating alloys that could rebuild his lost halls tenfold, braving cave-ins, rival dwarf clans, and mutating gas-veins that test his elixirs' limits in a descent of mechanical horrors. Strengths manifest in his prodigious gadgetry—steam-gauntlets that reshape metal mid-fight—and a prophetic intuition from Chronos-aligned spectacles. Weaknesses grind in his alchemical addictions; vapors from his own transformation elixirs erode his lungs, leaving him wheezing during chases. Sexually attuned to mechanical metamorphoses, Thrain indulges in slow infusions of gear-oils that shift flesh to brass and back, binding lovers in piston-driven harnesses where vulnerability builds through whirring nights, inverting control until the engine's hum drowns all but shared, cursed ecstasy."

His quest simmers with desperate familial redemption: infiltrate the council's sealed archives in Starspire to steal the soul-binding scroll that imprisons his sister's essence in a demon's thrall, navigating sky-island wards, guardian automatons, and illusory traps that prey on his guilt-ridden mind, turning every shadow into a potential family-saving revelation or heartbreaking deception. Adept in psionic evasion, Lorcan's strengths encompass mind-veils that cloak ships in phantom storms and a silver tongue weaving alibis from half-lies. Frailties lurk in his mounting debts to demon patrons, whose whispers erode his sanity during Mystra's blue swells.

Descended from Asuka Clan survivors of Razrias's fall, he communes with primordial echoes in ancient groves, 'protecting' the wilds by entangling intruders in spore-veins that harvest memories—knowledge he barters to elude hunters, indifferent to the minds fractured in the process. Driven by a twisted honor to ancestral ghosts, his ambition roots in the Yuria's thorned heart: unearth the Fractured Acorn of Razrias—a relic-seed said to regrow the lost kingdom's borders, expanding his domain through blight-wars on encroaching dwarven drills and human loggers, overcoming spirit trials that demand sacrifices of blood and forgotten kin to bloom its ambiguous paradise. Strengths root in his symbiotic bonds—vines that lash like living whips, augmented by air-magic gusts—and an unerring instinct for hidden paths.

Born into a multigenerational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects.

Overseeing them is Special Agent in Charge Isobel Castille, who operates under intense pressure and has undeniable command authority. The team also includes Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine, the nerve center of the office whose ability to easily relate to and engage with both superiors and subordinates makes him a master motivator, and also Special Agent Stuart Scola, an Ivy League-educated Wall Streeter-turned-FBI agent.

He proudly identifies with his heritage and religion but prefers to be called an \"American\" rather than \"Egyptian.\" He has three sisters. He mentioned growing up in Astoria, Queens, where there is a sizable Egyptian-American community. He has mentioned several times about the bullying he suffered during his childhood as a result of 9/11 and the subsequent rise of Islamophobia.\n\nOA graduated from the United States Military Academy (West Point) and left the U.S. Army with the rank of captain.

          "content": "Appearance\nMonika has thigh length coral brown hair that she keeps tied up in a high ponytail that is tied back with a large white bow, curled slightly at the ends. Like the other female characters, she has two prominent strands of hair beside her bangs that reach slightly past her chest. Her eyes are emerald green. She is of average height and believed to be the second tallest character behind either Yuri or the protagonist.\n\nShe wears the standard issue female school uniform consisting of a warm gray blazer fully buttoned and untucked, brown sweater vest, white shirt fully buttoned and tucked, red ribbon, dark blue pleated skirt, black thigh-high socks and white uwabaki slippers with pink tips.\n\nPersonality\nThe other characters describe Monika as intelligent, confident, and athletic. She is not as talkative as the other girls, but it is hinted that this is not by choice. Monika is also known to be highly popular, which makes the protagonist admire her. She is always depicted as mature and hardworking, with a serene, compassionate expression on her face.\n\nMonika had previously been a part of the Debate Club but left due to all of the inner politics and drama, highlighting a desire for order, freedom of topics and friendliness. The Literature Club, which she founded after leaving the Debate Club, is very important to her. She aspires for the Literature Club to be a place to showcase and grow everyone's passion for literature. She also has a passion for piano, which she practices frequently after school.\n\nMonika was originally a very considerate and kind person who was always thinking about the needs of other people.[4] She openly displays care and concern for her club mates, praising each member's writing style and even comparing them to famous authors and poets. However, it is later revealed that at some time before the start of the game, she underwent an epiphany which made her discover that she was in a game and also granted her the ability to edit the game's variables, changing her attitude towards the other girls because she knew they were not \"real\". She begins taking drastic measures when the other girls prevented the player from being able to spend time with her during the scene in Act 1 where the player has to choose a girl to help for the festival.\n\nIn desperation, Monika begins trying to make the other girls unlikable by altering their traits, as she only had the ability to edit variables within the game and did not want to delete/kill the other girls right away because of her lingering attachment to them. She starts with Sayori as she viewed her as the largest threat because she was the main character's childhood friend. Monika's alterations backfire because Sayori's increased depression level causes her to confess her love to the main character in an attempt to find happiness, then commit suicide the next day, regardless of the choice the player made. Monika then decides to delete Sayori's character file because \"she is the one who's making this so difficult.\"\n\nFrom Act 2 onward, she becomes even more manipulative than before. As the time goes by, she resents more and more having no romantic role in the game, as that meant there was no happy ending coded for her. She also makes her infatuation with the player more obvious and urges them to spend more time with her. Her desire and ambition lead her to become obsessive in this goal, highlighted by the fact that all of her poems are about the player or her epiphany. She also starts to disregard the other characters and amplifies their traits due to the fact of them not being \"real\". Ultimately, Monika's attempt to make the other girls unlikable led to her accidentally driving Yuri to suicide due to alterations to her personality, then finally to her simply deleting Natsuki in order to be able to spend time with the player alone in Act 3, creating her own \"happy ending.\"\n\nDespite Monika's upbeat attitude in the Literature Club, it becomes increasingly obvious that she is actually sad and lonely, as a result of being aware that her whole world is just a simulation. The worst part is that she can't even achieve what is considered \"happiness\", since her route can never be completed. She is fixated on obtaining the love of the player because they're the only \"real\" thing in her life. Monika's actions are also motivated by her desire to escape the torture she endures whenever someone quits the game, as when that happens Monika is trapped in a hellish void of noise, lights, colors, and screams, unable to move or even think. This is mentioned during Monika's Talk in Act 3.\n\nAfter deleting Yuri and Natsuki's files, Act 3 will happen, where she creates a world for her and the player, she will explain her motivations about her love towards the player. She will state that the main character does not exist, and that she only loves the player themselves. She will also explain how she amplified the other girls' undesirable traits to make them less likely to confess their love towards the protagonist. This includes Sayori's depression, Yuri's obsessiveness, and Natsuki's harshness. Monika will open the poem mini-game once more, except only distorted words of Monika's name are available, and only Monika's sticker sprite is present, with a loud ambience playing in the background. The background is now red with black glitches, different from the original desk background during the mini-game. After giving the poem to Monika, she will believe that the player wrote the poem specifically for her, and she calls the player sweet.\n\nAt this point in the game, the player will be able to read Monika's Talk where she talks directly to the player, albeit in a somewhat nihilistic manner, instead of the protagonist. It is shown that nothing about Monika's apparent kindness and politeness is an act, and she even offers the player some genuinely good advice from time to time.\n\nIf the player then decides to delete Monika's character file, she will immediately vanish, and search for her file in a panic. When she finds out the player deleted her, she will be mad at the player and tell them that they \"completely, truly make me sick.\" After a small pause, Monika tells the player that she still loves them. She will then feel the weight of her actions, realize the horrible things she has done to the other girls, and state that even though she knew they were not real people, she still saw them as her friends. Monika then restores the game, saying that if she really loves the player, she will bring back what they would have wanted. Monika is then absent for the rest of the game, until the final part of the normal ending.\n\nIf the normal ending is achieved, Sayori becomes self-aware, and glitches the game back to the room Monika stayed in on Act 3 for only the main character and herself. Monika will then delete Sayori's file, saying “No...I won't let you hurt him.” Monika states that there is no happiness in the Literature Club, and then deletes the entire game. The song \"Your Reality\" will play while the credits roll, which is inferred to be the song Monika wrote for the player. The game's CGs will be deleted during the credits, and a bittersweet letter from Monika will be shown, thanking the player for joining the Literature Club. The game will now be rendered unplayable until it is re-installed or the \"firstrun\" file is deleted.\n\nIf the good ending is achieved by playing through every girl's run via the save and load feature, Sayori will thank the player for spending time with all of the girls. Monika will still delete the game, but the CG's will not be deleted, and a letter from Dan Salvato thanking the player for playing his game will show instead"

          ],
          "content": "Natsuki has straight pastel pink hair, cut around chin length, and pink eyes. Her bangs are swept to the right, having two prominent strands of hair beside them. Her accessories consist of a red Japanese-style crossed hairclip, as well as two red ribbons tying two small ponytails on either side of her head, with the rest of her hair left down. Her canine teeth are longer than the rest of her teeth, making them visible when she opens her mouth wide enough. She is the shortest character in the Literature Club, a feature that results in people commonly mistaking her for a first year student.\n\nWhile in school, she wears the standard issue female school uniform consisting of a warm gray blazer fully buttoned and untucked, brown sweater vest, white shirt slightly unbuttoned at the collar, red ribbon, dark blue pleated skirt, white knee-high socks and white uwabaki slippers with sky blue tips.\n\nWhile out of school, she wears a short sleeved white shirt with a light pink cat face decoration on the left side with light pink trims lining the edges of the sleeves, light pink ruffled skirt with a black trim. Under the shirt, two black bra straps can be seen.\n\nPersonality\nNatsuki appears to be a brash, blunt, cranky, and even arrogant girl at first, but she has a cute, softer interior, causing Monika to class her as the real-life embodiment of a tsundere. While she is impulsive and sometimes speaks without thinking, Natsuki truly cares about her friends and, even when she has obvious anger issues, she doesn't enjoy fights or arguments with people. Over the course of the game, it is shown that she worries about Yuri, and, on one occasion, she gives the protagonist a note asking him to help Yuri, fearing that if she spoke out then it would cause more arguments. Natsuki is very stubborn and has a hard time expressing how she feels and what she wants. When repeatedly challenged, she often becomes awkward and tongue-tied, then aggressive, and then simply bursts into tears.\n\nNatsuki is also shown to be less pushy and more relaxed when she is outside of school, as mentioned by the protagonist when she visits his home. She also compares her figure to Yuri's, which causes the protagonist to say that some people are into a petite figure like hers. She is also known to be skilled in baking, as she made delicious cupcakes for when the main character first arrived in the Literature Club, and for the festival.\n\nNatsuki's cute interior also involves a love of manga and anime, particularly those in the slice-of-life genre, and baking. She has been known to store her manga collection in the Literature Club out of embarrassment; another reason (hinted at) is because her father would be angry while the rest of the club obviously knows about her interest, and she is still hesitant to talk about it. Natsuki also likes cute things, such as cupcakes with cat faces, and prefers poems with cuter, happier words, though her own poems are still about sad things, such as being persecuted for one's hobbies.\n\nNatsuki believes that it's important to be able to express something deep with few words. Her simplistic writing style puts her at odds with Yuri, who has a more extravagant style. In Act 1, the protagonist is tasked with siding with Natsuki, Yuri, or asking for Sayori's help after an argument between Yuri and Natsuki regarding writing styles. Choosing Yuri will cause her to be offended, and the player attempts to read Natsuki their poem, Natsuki will immediately shoo them away.\n\nNatsuki hates being called \"cute,\" even when she acts as such or does cute things, and she will deny any claims from others relating to this; nevertheless, she is much more comfortable exposing her sweet side once she knows people aren't going to tease her about it. Natsuki hates it if she isn't taken seriously, whether it's her writing, her hobbies, or just her overall demeanor. It is likely she learned to be ashamed of herself and her hobbies because her classmates judge her and because of her implied abusive father, making her abrasive nature a coping mechanism. This is also implied in a secret poem, \"Things I Like About Papa,\" which is most likely written by her.\nIt is shown that she is a very lonely person who desperately craves affection from anyone. One example is during the third poetry-sharing session: if Natsuki has liked all the player's poems to date, she outright asks the protagonist if he thinks her poems are the best, which quickly shifts to her begging him to say they are, even if he hates them.\n\nDuring Act 2, Natsuki, for the most part, predominantly resembles her original Act 1 character. However, due to Monika tampering with Natsuki and Yuri’s files to make them more unlikable to the player, like Yuri, Natsuki’s underlying problems that were subtly implied during Act 1 are disturbingly revealed; in particular, Act 2 focuses more on her father and Monika’s influence onto that aspect.\n\nIf the player writes a poem for Natsuki, the protagonist will read manga with Natsuki, and during the middle of the session, she will fall asleep. The protagonist will try to rouse her, and she will glitch out, with a mass of black glitches covering her eyes and mouth, and her dialogue will be distorted. Monika will find them and ask if she's okay, to when Natsuki doesn't respond, Monika will throw her an energy bar for her to eat. Monika then tells the player that Natsuki is malnourished, which could possibly be due to her father. This can also be the reason for her lack of height and her small body, and more personality-wise the reason for her refusing to open up sometimes.\n\nAct 2 also displays a more possessive Natsuki, as shown in the scene when she argues with Monika over getting new members. She doesn't have a lot of places that are safe for her, so when she does have one, she prefers for it to remain intact. Additionally, it is hinted that the personality of Natsuki's father has been exacerbated, which could also be a factor of her possessiveness and amplified wrath.\n\nIf Natsuki is written another poem in Act 2, Natsuki will show immediate jealousy for the protagonist spending time with Yuri. She will show the main character her poem, which is written in Base 64. She will then start asking the player if the player just wants her to suffer, and telling him that he should stop hanging out with Yuri, and to spend time with her instead. A distorted version of \"Okay, Everyone!\" will play, and Natsuki's eyes and mouth will be covered by a mass of black glitches, her skin becoming more pale, and blood will rush down her face, to resemble crying blood. She will then yell \"PLAY WITH ME!!!\", the mass of glitches on her mouth replaced with a wide smile, and her neck will snap and bend to the left abruptly, and will rush towards the screen. The screen will now show a black screen with the word \"END\" backwards on it. However, when starting up the game once more, there seems to be no lasting consequences from that scene, with Natsuki still intact and the Literature Club seeming mostly normal. This could be a physically corrupted version of Natsuki’s own feelings, showing her possessiveness, jealousy, and loneliness (which ties back to how her father’s amplified actions affecting her).\n\nOverall, if the player goes for Natsuki in Act 2 (by choosing poem words she likes each day), certain moments in the game are shifted to be more negative towards her. Notably, Yuri and Monika are more hostile towards Natsuki: During Day 3 before Yuri reads with the protagonist and when the protagonist brings up Natsuki, she says \"Don’t think about her too much. She is used to being ignored. Come on, we’re going over there.\" During Day 4 when Natsuki apologizes for interrupting Yuri and wanting to help with the Festival, instead of a small wholesome moment between her and Yuri, the latter instead says \"Natsuki…Nobody cares. Why don’t you look for some coins under the vending machine or something?\", which causes Natsuki to be shocked and leave crying. During the same day when preparing for the Festival, instead of Natsuki saying she wants to make cupcakes herself when Monika attempts to give her a role to do, Monika says instead \"Natsuki, you can make cupcakes. I know you’re at least good at that.\", followed by a saddened Natsuki sprite. Even when the player chooses words for Natsuki, they are still forced to spend time with Yuri. Of course, this is all a symbolic representation of how Natsuki is downplayed, ignored, and treated unfairly.\n\nIn her next \"poem,\" Natsuki, similar to Yuri, is shown to be somewhat \"aware\" of Monika’s influence around everyone, or at least aware of how Yuri isn’t acting as her normal self and how Monika ignores it. She tries to come to the protagonist about it for help, suggesting them to help Yuri seek therapy and offering to make cupcakes for the protagonist. After this, the screen will glitch for a few seconds and show a faceless, pale-skin Natsuki with Monika corrupting the dialogue to tell the player to spend time with her.\n\nAfter Yuri's suicide, she comes inside the club to find Yuri's decomposing body. She will yelp loudly, scream, then vomits all over her uniform before running away. Monika appears shortly after and deletes Yuri and Natsuki’s files. Monika then grabs one of Natsuki’s cupcakes (which appears as jumbled symbols like with Sayori), saying they’re the best and wanted to have one before they \"stop existing\" before starting Act 3."

          "content": "Yuri has waist length dark purple hair and light purple eyes and wears a purple barrette on the right side of her head, positioned upon her right prominent strand of hair beside her bangs. She is of above average height.\n\nWhile in school, she wears the standard issue female school uniform consisting of a warm gray blazer fully buttoned and untucked, brown sweater vest, white shirt slightly unbuttoned at the collar and tucked, red ribbon, dark blue pleated skirt, white knee-high socks and white uwabaki slippers with sky blue tips.\n\nWhile out of school, she is shown wearing a beige long sleeved turtleneck sweater with black leggings. The protagonist describes her movements as surprisingly elegant due to her long legs.\n\nShe is also the most physically developed, adding to her traits of maturity and insecurity.\n\nPersonality\nYuri is portrayed throughout the majority of the game as being shy, generous, polite, apologetic, very intelligent, eloquent, and passionate about topics she is interested in, although she is also very insecure, awkward, and has a tendency to act slightly condescending and patronizing to mask her self-doubt. Yuri expresses both maturity and sophistication in everything she does. Her façade of passivity and level-headed nature occasionally breaks, however, as Yuri does argue passionately and aggressively with Natsuki over their differing opinions on writing styles and types of literature. Yuri has a deep desire to be liked by others and is afraid to speak her mind on certain matters as she believes it will make her seem unlikable. Due to her social ineptitude, she can be innocently insensitive, but once she realizes what she said could be considered rude, she almost immediately apologizes, repeatedly saying she did not mean it. As stated by the protagonist, Yuri likes to think before she says something.\n\nYuri prefers to blend in with the scenery than to attract unwanted attention. The attribution is also because of being shy to discussions beyond her category of interest, her interests being literature, horror, and general surrealism, which she examines and articulates expertly and encourages others to follow as well. During Act 1, Natsuki and Yuri get into a debate about their different writing styles. Choosing to side with Natsuki will cause Yuri to shy away from the player, and if the protagonist attempts to read their poem to Yuri, she will not respond, which will cause the protagonist to decide it is best to leave her alone. If the player calls for Sayori to diffuse the situation, Sayori will compliment both Yuri and Natsuki on their writing, appearance and capabilities. This strategy will satisfy both girls, but also leave them embarrassed.\n\nYuri's love of surrealism seems to be foreshadowing further events of the game, with Yuri's surrealistic eyes and the game's sudden shift to horror after Sayori's suicide. Yuri prefers poetry that uses metaphorical symbolism and enjoys collecting unusual ornate knives, which are implied to be used for self-harm. The detailed summaries of the Portrait of Markov novel in the first and second act, when also taking the scattered dialogue references into account, all end up tracing back to her unstable nature and unhinged personality.\nYuri takes great pride in her poetry and perceives her poetry as being superior to that of the other club members, especially Natsuki. According to Dan Salvato [citation needed], this is a coping mechanism for her deep insecurity and self-doubt, convincing herself that she is the sophisticated, mature one and that her critics or rivals are immature and childish. This can make her seem arrogant and patronizing to those unfamiliar to her. This desire to seem intellectual is reflected in her poetic style. Her poems are so full of metaphors and advanced language that the meaning is often obscured, or even lost. In Monika's Talk, while talking about Yuri's habit of drinking tea while reading, Monika wonders whether Yuri is as passionate about certain topics as she makes out, or whether she is \"just concerned about appearing sophisticated to everyone else.\"\n\nYuri has trouble making and keeping friends, as she tends to come on too strongly, due to her intense desire to be liked. She used to be judged for her appearance and mannerisms, providing another possible explanation as to why she secludes herself to her introverted lifestyle. She is, however, a generous and giving person, exemplified by her giving a copy of Portrait of Markov to the protagonist and for bringing tea to the Literature Club to help soothe the mind and help stay focused during reading.\n\nDuring Act 2, Monika amplifies Yuri's negative personality traits, causing her crush on the protagonist to become an unhealthy obsession, at one point Yuri admits that she touches herself with the pen she took from him, and her already-existing hobby involving knife collecting becomes a love of self-harm, to the point where Monika suggests that Yuri cuts herself due to a fetish. This also causes her to become invasive and condescending to the other club members, asking Natsuki \"Why don't you look for coins under the vending machine?\", which causes Natsuki to cry and run away. In one occasion, Yuri shows a poem to the protagonist with blood and waste stains on it, telling him that she has 'put her scent on it'. Yuri will then realize what she has truly done and leave the club, stating that she is going to vomit.\n\nIf all three poems are written for Yuri in Act 2, the scene where Yuri is discovered to be cutting herself will happen once more, but then will show Yuri with blank eyes and a glitching sprite. Afterwards, she will be mildly unsettled, mentioning that she had some serious deja-vu. She then will talk about how she’s always despised how she got a little too excited about certain topics that caused her to isolate herself from other people. She then asks the player about Monika, and how she's changing from a sweet girl to more manipulative. But then, she will state that they are finally alone, away from \"Monika's slimy tongue\" and Natsuki who is a \"pathetic child\". Then, she will try to convince the main character to stay with her, and will seem to be overtly excited, with randomly glitching pupils. Monika's sprite will also slowly fade into view, covering Yuri while her dialogue continues.\n\nYuri recognizes that something is wrong with her and that her comments and behavior are inappropriate, enough so to feel something bad will happen despite her happiness. She is ultimately unable to control her obsessive outbursts, no matter how hard she tries. It reaches a point where, after she confesses her love to the protagonist, she stabs herself to death, regardless of whether the player accepts or rejects her love. Yuri's body is left decomposing for three days, and is then discovered by Natsuki, who immediately vomits and runs away. When she is discovered by Monika, both Yuri and Natsuki's files are deleted, leading to Act 3.\n\n"

          "content": "Appearance\nSayori has coral pink hair, cut chin-length and slightly curled at the ends, with a large red bow on the upper left side of her head. Like the other female characters, she has two prominent strands of hair beside her bangs, and her eyes are a bright sky blue. She is of short-to-average height, which makes her the second shortest character in the game, before Natsuki.\n\nWhen in school, she wears the standard issue female school uniform consisting of a warm gray blazer fully unbuttoned and untucked, brown sweater vest, white shirt slightly unbuttoned and crooked at the collar and tucked, red ribbon that's displaced, dark blue pleated skirt, white knee-high socks and white uwabaki slippers with sky blue tips.\n\nWhen outside school, she wears a pink shirt with rolled-up long sleeves and blue shorts. On the morning of her death, she is seen wearing a brown collared white dress shirt, which has a pocket on each side, brown folds and six black buttons, the top one being unbuttoned, slim-fitting red shorts and was barefoot.\n\nPersonality\nSayori is initially portrayed as the character archetype of a Genki Girl, expressing a bubbly and cheery disposition. She is very clumsy, noted for finding ways to accidentally hurt herself or to drop random things. Regardless, she is shown to be a jokingly cunning individual who can trick others to get food, shown after managing to eat Natsuki's cookie without her permission. Sayori has also been known by the protagonist to obsess over activities that she loses interest in later. She states that writing poetry and studying literature is different to her than those other interests because it helps her explore her feelings.\n\nHowever, it is later revealed that she suffers from bad depression and works so hard to make the people around her happy to cope with her own lack of self-love amongst other things. She is also usually the only character, other than the protagonist, shown to break up arguments, Monika noting that her sentiments are necessary to keep a relaxing atmosphere in the Literature Club. This is proven by her absence in Act 2. Monika also notes that while she may look like a good leader, Sayori is usually better when it comes to dealing with people, notably at mediations. She tries her best to help everyone be happy and dislikes attention directed at her well-being because she feels unworthy of anything that others have to offer her.\n\nSayori is also introduced as the protagonist's childhood friend. The protagonist seems to view her as an airhead and slightly annoying at the beginning of the game, but he starts to sympathize with her after she confesses about her depression.\n\nSayori's depression makes her disorganized, and she often cannot find a reason to get out of bed in the morning when she tries to wake up, which is why she is usually late for school. Her room, which the protagonist regularly cleaned for her, is also noted to be untidy. The protagonist notes how there hasn't been much change in her, and the changes the protagonist notices in her later are due to Monika's interference, amplifying her depression and suicidal tendencies.\n\nHer depression seems to make her believe that she does not deserve to be loved, but at the same time she wants to be loved, especially by the protagonist, whom she has a crush on. When the player chooses to pursue one of the other girls, Sayori seems to suffer because she secretly wants the protagonist to love her while at the same time experiencing guilt for feeling bad in the first place. Her depression is also gradually amplified by Monika at this point. However, if the player actively chooses to pursue Sayori, she will still experience guilt since she doesn't believe that she deserves to be loved. Regardless of the player's choice, Sayori will kill herself on the day of the festival in the early morning hours.[4] Her relationship with the protagonist and other people's happiness are her main coping mechanisms since she believes that if she makes everyone else happy, she will not have a reason whatsoever to be unhappy.\n\n\n\nWhen Sayori confesses her love for the protagonist, she will either hug him or run away with a pained expression, depending on whether the player accepts her feelings, or rejects them. The next day, the protagonist will go to school without her, assuming she was still asleep. There, he will read a poem written by Sayori named \"%\", with the words \"Get out of my head\" repeated constantly. This will cause the protagonist to panic and go to Sayori's house, where she will be found dead, hanging from a noose with blood on her hands. If the player tries to load their save after her death, the game states that the save files are corrupt and completely reboots, as if Sayori never existed, thus she is temporarily gone from the timeline. This would mark the end of Act 1.\n\nAfter Monika restores each member's file, at the start of Act 4, Sayori will again be present in the game and its timeline, alive and well. Natsuki and Yuri will also be present, also unharmed. This time, Sayori is the club president instead of Monika. Towards the end of the game, one out of two endings will happen. If the player achieves the normal ending, Sayori will reveal that since she is now also self-aware, possibly because she is now the club president, and will thank the player for deleting Monika. The scene then moves from the club into the room Monika was in during Act 3, as she claims how happy she will be to be with the player forever. Monika will then delete Sayori, stating that she \"won't let her hurt him,\" and then will delete the entire game.\n\nIf the good ending is achieved, Sayori will instead thank the player for spending time with all of the girls, saying that it's all that she wanted. She will then thank the player for playing Doki Doki Literature Club and with a few tears in her eyes say that they all love the player.\n\nIt is worth noting that Act 1 establishes that Sayori sleeps in because of her depression, which is why she is often late for school. In Act 4, however, Sayori tells the protagonist that she has been waking up on time lately. This implies that her depression has been alleviated to some degree."

          "content": "Day 2\nNatsuki's Route\nIf the protagonist writes a poem for Natsuki, he will spend the club time with her reading manga by the club room's closet. Once the time to share poems arrives, Monika, Sayori, and Yuri comment on the likeness to Natsuki's writing style, whereas Natsuki is flustered and dismisses the protagonist's poem as merely \"okay,\" showing traits typical of the tsundere type to which she is likened.\n\nYuri's Route\nIf the protagonist chooses to write for Yuri, the second day will entail reading a book which she had bought for him, The Portrait of Markov, although she denies doing this, which shows a CG of reading beside each other from the same book. The protagonist makes comments on how the book's main character reminds him of Yuri, to which she becomes extremely embarrassed.\n\nWhen sharing the protagonist's poem with Yuri, she is taken aback but provides constructive feedback for the protagonist to consider and use to improve their writing style.\n\nSayori's Route\nIf the protagonist chooses to write for Sayori, he will fall asleep at one of the desks, only to then be woken up by Sayori. The protagonist will comment that she takes better care of him than she does for herself and points out some flaws in Sayori's appearance, which leads to a CG of him buttoning up her blazer.\n\nWhen sharing the protagonist's poem with Sayori, she states that she likes it a lot and when the protagonist reads her poem, he mocks her for writing hers on the day itself.\n\nArgument\nAfter sharing his poem with all four girls, the protagonist notices Yuri and Natsuki in the process of sharing theirs. Natsuki remarks that Yuri's poem is \"fancy,\" to which Yuri responds by saying hers is \"cute,\" offending Natsuki. The two then argue about their writing styles, eventually leading to Natsuki accusing Yuri of trying to impress the protagonist. Insulted, Yuri tells Natsuki that she is just jealous, claiming that the protagonist likes her poem more, but Natsuki only responds by telling Yuri that she needs to stop being full of herself. The protagonist then has to decide how to respond. Whoever he picks also gets 5 extra points for the next poem game, helping the player to grow closer to that girl.\n\nIf the protagonist agrees with Natsuki, she becomes proud and happily accepts his opinion, only for the protagonist to chide her when Yuri becomes upset. The protagonist explains his reasonings to Yuri, although it is clear that she is not completely convinced, if listening at all. Natsuki then reluctantly apologizes to Yuri.\n\nIf the protagonist takes Yuri's side, he says that he likes Yuri's writing more, but that Natsuki's writing shouldn't be criticized. Yuri apologizes to Natsuki, but Naksuki is still upset. Monika steps in, reminding Natsuki that Yuri already apologized, prompting her to do the same. Sayori tells Natsuki about taking a walk to cool her head, causing the latter to storm out of the club in embarrassment.\n\nIf the protagonist instead asks Sayori for help, she will go on to praise both girls for their unique writing styles, but also accidentally cause more awkwardness with her comments, making both Yuri and Natsuki very embarrassed, yet successfully ending the fight. The protagonist then praises Sayori for helping out.\n\nIt is noted that for whoever is sided with in the argument, the other party does not apologize. When choosing Natsuki, Yuri leaves prematurely at Sayori's remark, while when choosing Yuri, Natsuki defiantly exits the clubroom. When choosing Sayori, neither Yuri nor Natsuki apologize, although dialogue from the next few days suggest a slight reconciliation between the two.\n\nDay 3\nNatsuki's Route\nOn day three, Monika is found to have moved all of Natsuki's manga up to the top shelf of the classroom's closet, and she is forced to find a way to reach them. This awards the player with a CG as the protagonist holds onto the chair while Natsuki grabs the box of manga, in a position where he can almost see up her skirt. Once she has the box, she asks the protagonist to take it, but she changes her mind as she looks down and thinks that he is looking up her skirt, even though he isn't. Her anger in this situation causes her to fall, and she lands on top of the protagonist, accidentally causing him to crease a page in one of the manga. He does his best to cheer Natsuki up, and she thanks him for being so nice to her, which is unusual for her to say.\n\nIf the protagonist sided with Natsuki during the argument, Yuri will ask him if he's still mad at her, leading to a very awkward misunderstanding. Yuri refuses to share poems and asks the protagonist to leave, saying she has her books to keep her company.\n\nYuri's Route\nOn the third day, Yuri and the protagonist continue where they left off in the book from the second day. Yuri requests to sit against the wall on the floor, rather than at the desks, hoping that the change of seating will help her to ease her frequent back pain. The protagonist suggests that this is due to her bad reading posture, which Yuri goes along with, though it is implied to actually be caused by having an above average bust size. Yuri goes to get tea with the protagonist, but Monika interjects, stating that it is a one-person thing, to which Yuri very coldly responds that it is none of her business. Once in the hallway, Yuri immediately regrets what she said and the protagonist quickly reassures her. Yuri notes that he is being very nice to her and states that she likes being friends with him. When they get back, the protagonist offers her some chocolate, and Yuri expresses how she cannot hold it while holding her book, prompting him to feed her a piece of chocolate, earning the player a CG in the process. When the protagonist does feed her chocolate, Yuri gets embarrassed, but Monika interrupts them before anything else can happen.\n\nWhen sharing poems, Yuri is even more impressed with the protagonist's poems, noting all the different techniques the protagonist used. If the protagonist sided with Yuri during the argument, Natsuki quickly realizes that his poem was written for the former and angrily dismisses him.\n\nSayori's Route\nSayori asks the protagonist to help her gather art supplies so she can make posters for the upcoming school festival. She explains what is planned for the event as they search for an empty classroom, and demonstrates her version of a poetry performance. When they find a room, Sayori immediately finds a box of crayons, then drops one. When she bends over to pick it up, Sayori smacks her forehead against a closet shelf. The protagonist decides to get something cold for Sayori's forehead, so he runs to a nearby vending machine and buys a bottle of apple juice, which she holds on her forehead. Sayori then comments on how she misses the times she and the protagonist grew up together.\n\nWhen sharing poems, Sayori remarks that she is once again impressed and that she loves reading them every day. The protagonist then admits that he writes better when he's thinking of Sayori, which causes her to react in shock.\n\nDay 4\nOn day four, when the protagonist enters the clubroom, he notices Sayori sitting at a desk and staring blankly. When he asks her what's wrong, Sayori hurriedly dismisses him, causing him to become worried. He first asks Monika about her, but Monika says that she does not notice anything off, but she goes over to talk to her.\n\nNatsuki's Route\nWhen the protagonist talks to Natsuki about Sayori, she immediately becomes jealous. However, after going into more detail, Natsuki calms down and reassures the protagonist that since Sayori is his best friend, if she did have problems, she would bring that up to the protagonist himself.\n\nWhen sharing poems, Natsuki seems to finally admit that she likes the protagonist's poems, even comparing him to her skills. She then begs him to tell her that she is a good writer. When the protagonist asks for her poem, Natsuki becomes very apprehensive and does not show it to him, claiming that it is a bad poem, but she finally gives in and hands it to the protagonist. It is revealed that her poem is actually about the protagonist himself, which is why she was nervous about letting him read it. When the protagonist tries to return it, Natsuki declines shyly, saying that she does not want it.\n\nYuri turns away shyly when approached by the protagonist, causing him to share with another member instead.\n\nSayori notes how the protagonist wrote his poem for Natsuki and is clearly upset by something, but before the protagonist can say anything, she leaves the classroom early, claiming she is tired.\n\nYuri's Route\nAfter Monika goes over to talk to Sayori, the protagonist notices Yuri staring at him from behind her book. When he asks her about Sayori, Yuri states that she also noticed Sayori's weird behavior and told the protagonist that Sayori could be harboring feelings for him and that Sayori is very lucky to have someone like him care about her.\n\nShe then has a heart-to-heart talk with him about her love for books and the characters inside them, and how she struggles with talking to real people due to her social anxiety, as well as her low self-esteem. She also tells the protagonist that all these feelings have faded over the week because of the protagonist treating her like everybody else. Unlike Natsuki, she is extremely eager to show her poem, but just like Natsuki's poem, it is a tribute to the protagonist. When the protagonist finishes her poem, she becomes exceptionally flustered and looks away, but he reassures her that he likes it. Like Natsuki, when he hands her back her poem, she returns it to him, asking him to keep it.\n\nNatsuki again angrily dismisses the protagonist and refuses to share poems.\n\nSayori again reacts as she did if the protagonist pursues Natsuki.\n\nSayori's Route\nWhen sharing poems, Sayori states that it is the protagonist's best poem so far, but the protagonist again asks her what is wrong, only for Sayori to start tearing up and asking the protagonist why he chose not to befriend the other girls. The protagonist claims that he and Sayori have a wavelength, but Sayori only gets sadder, saying how it would be easier on her if the protagonist instead talked to the other girls. When he gets worried, Sayori quickly dismisses the conversation and heads home.\n\nNormal Route (Beach Poem)\nIf Yuri or Natsuki do not love or hate the protagonist's poems more than once, they will skip the romantic poem and instead write a normal poem on the subject of beaches.\n\nFestival Preparations\nAfter Sayori leaves, Monika gives each club member an assignment related to the upcoming festival. Monika will be printing pamphlets to promote the club, Sayori will be helping her design them, Natsuki will be baking cupcakes, and Yuri will be creating banners to set the atmosphere for the clubroom, leaving the protagonist to decide on whom to help.\n\nIf the protagonist chooses to help Monika, Natsuki and Yuri immediately disagree and tell Monika that her job is the easiest. On top of that, she already has Sayori helping her, so she doesn't need a third partner to help her out. This causes Monika to defend herself further, rebutting that the two of them also have ulterior motives. Natsuki and Yuri then tell Monika to be more responsible, saying that being alone would lower the standards of their work and that the club's resources should be fairly divided. Monika finally gives in, but even though she agrees, she is upset that she is unable to spend any time with the protagonist.\n\nThe same thing happens if the protagonist chooses to help Sayori. Natsuki and Yuri again state that Sayori and Monika would be working together, therefore she would require the least amount of help out of anyone.\n\nIf the protagonist picks Natsuki, she is delighted, even though she didn't want any help. Yuri becomes passive-aggressive, stating that she's used to working alone by now. Natsuki tries to cheer up Yuri, which surprises everyone. The protagonist then exchanges phone numbers with her.\n\nIf the protagonist picks Yuri, she is taken aback and becomes flustered again. Natsuki claims to not care about the protagonist's decision, but everyone knows that she is miserable about it. Yuri then tries to cheer Natsuki up, praising her for her talent in baking, which appears to work, but makes the protagonist, feel that she is acting like Sayori. The protagonist then exchanges phone numbers with Yuri.\n\nSunday\nBefore the protagonist goes to hang out with either Natsuki or Yuri, he decides to check on Sayori first. Sayori then reveals to the protagonist that she has had bad depression her whole life. The protagonist is taken aback and tries to help Sayori by hugging her and offering to spend the whole day of the festival with her. After that, he suggests skipping his \"date\" with Yuri or Natsuki, but Sayori tells him not to.\n\nNatsuki's Route\nWhen the protagonist returns to his home, Natsuki arrives soon after, and he invites her into his house. The two get started with baking, but when Natsuki playfully tries to get him dirty with a bit of icing, there's a CG of him catching Natsuki by both of her wrists and pinning her up against the kitchen wall. The protagonist then licks the icing off of her finger, which makes her feel shocked and embarrassed. After the cupcakes are baked and decorated, the two stand outside the protagonist's house when Natsuki suddenly tries to kiss him, and Sayori interrupts them.\n\nYuri's Route\nAfter the protagonist leaves Sayori's house, he finds Yuri already at his house waiting for him. The two go inside and start preparing the items needed for the decorative banners. To cut ribbons, Yuri takes out a small pocket knife and goes on to tell the protagonist about her slight obsession with knives. When the protagonist leaves to collect water and returns, he finds Yuri happily unrolling her sleeve. This might be a hint that Yuri cuts herself, but Yuri quickly ends the conversation before he can ask any questions. Eventually, the protagonist accidentally gets paint on Yuri's face, and the player is awarded a CG of him wiping off her face with a warm towel. When they finish making the banners, Yuri states that she wishes she had more time to spend with him. The protagonist suggests hanging out another time, and a grateful Yuri moves closer to the protagonist, presumably for a kiss, but is interrupted by Sayori.\n\nSayori's Confession\nAfter Sayori interrupts Yuri or Natsuki, they become flustered and hurry home. She begins to cry, admitting that it hurts her to see the protagonist spending time with the other girls. Sayori then confesses her true feelings to the protagonist.\n\nIf the protagonist accepts her confession, he and Sayori share a loving embrace. The protagonist reassures Sayori that he will be with her to help her through her hardships. Sayori hesitantly accepts this and goes home.\n\nIf the protagonist rejects her confession, Sayori tries to stay positive, but knowing that he only sees her as a friend breaks her heart. Before the protagonist can do anything, she runs off."

          "content": "day 2\nMonika's poem is the only one that differs on the second day of Act 2 than the second day of Act 1. Her poem is supposedly a sequel to her first poem of Act 1, Hole in the Wall, though this poem has the same name. Here, she touches upon the idea that there must be a way to escape the game because the player is right in front of her.\nNatsuki and Yuri will give the player their first poems from Act 1, Eagles Can Fly and Ghost in the Light, respectively.\nNatsuki and Yuri get in a heated argument, and Monika takes the player out of the classroom and into the hallway. She then waits for a while before deciding that it’s safe to go in. Suddenly, Natsuki will burst into the hallway, crying. She rushes past the player, and upon returning to the classroom, Yuri will repeat: “I didn’t mean it,” and continues to ask the player not to hate her for it. Monika will then comfort Yuri by telling her that Natsuki will forget all about it tomorrow, implying that Monika will erase the memory from Natsuki’s character file.\nDay 3\nNatsuki will no longer remember the argument that she got into with Yuri the day before, and when Yuri attempts to apologize, Natsuki says she doesn’t remember anything bad that happened the day before.\nMonika's poem is a continuation of the second poem she gives the player in Act 2 – both are called Save Me. They are fundamentally the same, though some words are changed, it is spaced out differently, and some of the words have been randomly capitalized. The last line of this poem is \"Delete Her\", while the last line of the first Save Me is \"Load Me\".\nShe will give the player her Writing Tip of the Day, where she tells them to save their game. Realizing her \"Writing Tip\" was not about writing, she begins to panic a bit:\nHere's Monika's Writing Tip of the Day! / Sometimes you'll find yourself facing a difficult decision... / When that happens, don't forget to save your game! / You never know when...um... / ...Who am I talking to? / Can you hear me? / Tell me you can hear me. / Anything. / Please help me. / ...That's my advice for today! / Thanks for listening~\n\nYuri, while reading with the protagonist, gets overly excited and leaves the classroom to get water from the drinking fountain, though in reality, she sneaks off to go cut herself again. When she comes back, she gives the protagonist her poem, which is called Wheel. It is made up of many fragmented sentences which almost all contain vague and unexplained concepts like \"Exponential gearbox\" and \"God disproving the existence of God\".\nIf you've written two poems for Natsuki, her poem will be Base64 code, that when decoded reveals a poem called Open Your Third Eye, where the writer details how they feel pleasure from cutting up a woman.\nAfterward, Natsuki will cry blood, and her eyes and mouth will glitch. She will speak in bold text until a large slasher smile takes the place of her glitching mouth, then she will run toward the protagonist. This event unlocks a special poem.\nIf the player doesn't appeal to Natsuki for the first two days, this event will not occur, and Natsuki will tell the protagonist to go away instead of giving him a poem.\nDay 4\nNatsuki will talk to the protagonist briefly about her poem before handing him a paper with a note on it. Within the note, she begs him to get Yuri mental help as she is concerned for her friend and fears that her interfering will only make things worse. She also partly blames Monika for being dismissive about Yuri's mental health.\nUpon closing the poem, Natsuki glitches and reappears but more pale and with a blank face, like a mannequin. She tells him to ignore the note and that things would probably get better if he spends more time with Monika. She repeats the phrase, \"Just Monika\" several times, the game states the phrase, then it fakes starting up again only to have the warning text say, \"Just Monika.\"\nMonika will say that spending time with Yuri is enabling her to cut herself and that she would like the player to spend more time with her instead of Yuri. Instead of receiving a poem, the game will glitch out and she will tell the player to just move on.\nIf one is playing on a Windows PC in full-screen mode, it will fake a blue screen of death and reveal that Monika was trying to escape the game, prevalent by the error code being called DDLC_ESCAPE_PLAN_FAILED.\nYuri will obsess over the player's physical poem by breathing into it and asking to take it home. She then excitedly offers her poem, titled mdpnfbo,jrfp, which has blood and yellow stains on it and is written in the Damagrafik Script Font, making the poem nearly illegible. Most of the words are randomly picked or not words at all, but the last few sentences detail someone taking pleasure in stabbing a teenage girl to death.\nAfterward, the screen becomes cloudy and dark, and Yuri gets very close, stares directly at the protagonist with frighteningly realistic eyes, and asks if he likes it. She tries to explain what the poem is about, but spouts random letters and characters instead. She also explains that she has \"endowed it with her scent\", implying that the yellow stains are urine. She then glitches and runs off, saying she has to vomit.\nA heated quarrel occurs over who the protagonist should help in preparation for the festival. Whereas in Act 1, the player was able to choose who to help, three buttons appear, reading Yuri, Natsuki, and Monika. However, in this act, the cursor is forcefully moved towards Monika.\nIf the player manages to press Yuri or Natsuki, a white screen will appear, with Yuri's realistic purple eyes staring directly at the player. After a few seconds, the default “choice” screen reappears, but this time with randomly generated text at the bottom, and the only choice buttons are “Monika,” filling the entire screen top to bottom.\nIf the player selects Monika instead, the game continues as normal.\nAfter said quarrel, and after the player inevitably chooses Monika, Yuri ejects Monika and Natsuki from the room, and confesses her love for the protagonist in an obsessive manner. No matter whether the player accepts or rejects her confession, she stabs herself twice in the stomach, and once in the chest before falling to the ground.\nDue to the game‘s broken script, the player is left motionless with Yuri’s decaying body over the weekend, evident by the change in lighting as the sun rises and sets outside the classroom, with Yuri's blood darkening and her eye color fading over time. Her smile will also fade into a frown. When Natsuki walks into the club room, she immediately screams, vomits and rushes out. When Monika enters, she apologizes for the protagonist‘s “boring” weekend and displays compensation by deleting Yuri and Natsuki’s character files from the game and sending the player back to the main menu.\nOdd Occurrences\nIf the protagonist appeals to Yuri on Day 1 and then Natsuki on Day 2, Natsuki's eyes explode out of her head after a short pause before the game returns to normal.\nWhen Yuri kills herself and players wait through her dialogue, checking the history will reveal that all of her lines are replaced with the Steam description of the game, followed by a couple lines of \"Will you promise to spend the most time with me?\" repeated at the end.\nWhen the protagonist talks to Yuri at the corridor the second time after seeing her arms cut, once the screen darkens and the background music is replaced with someone breathing, Yuri's eyes will become \"realistic\" after every fourth exhale, before reverting to normal after said exhale.\nIf appealing to Natsuki on Day 1's poem, even if the player primarily picks Natsuki's key phrases for Day 2's Poem, Monika will still point out that the poem appeals to Yuri.\nIn the background, a poster of Sayori hanging herself is seen, though it disappears the next scene."

She explains that everything that had happened up until this point was her doing. She has power over the game, and she's also aware that she's trapped in the game.\n\nShe confesses that she made Sayori's depression more severe, causing her sudden suicide, caused Natsuki to become more harsh than she normally is, and made Yuri even more obsessive than usual. She furthermore explains that she did so because she thought that it would make the player want to spend less time with them and more time with her, but things did not go according to plan. There were more mistakes she made since Monika did not account for the things that would happen if she messed with the character files. It is also noted that at this point, the player cannot save or load the game anymore, and all the previous saves they had were erased. If the player tries to save their game, Monika will send a pop-up message that says, \"There's no point in saving anymore, don't worry, I'm not going anywhere\".

          "content": "The Onnai(The Onnai are a mono-sexual species of female insectoid creatures. They have the appearance of humanoid butterflies, being a majority humanoid, but with several distinct features, such as their wings and antenna, and their skin come in three distinct colors, blue, red, and purple.\n\nThey are known to be the most beautiful of all species throughout the galaxy, admired by all. This admiration has given a majority of their population a large superiority complex, and as a whole, they often view themselves as a superior species.\n\nThe lifecycle of an Onnai is quite strict and regimented, having three distinct phases of life: childhood, hibernation, and adulthood. During infancy Onnai are completely and utterly vulnerable, being in a sort of larval stage, and they are often kept in sterile, temperature controlled pods, known as “Maturation Chambers”. They mature slowly over the course of twenty four years, and are periodically taken out of their pods, in order to familiarize themselves with the outside world, and attend lessons on Onnai history and culture.\n\nAt the age of twenty four, an Onnai has reached maturity, and quickly move onto the next stage of life. Due to being a solely female species, they cannot reproduce without the help of outside forces, which has led to them creating a very specific, and somewhat strange method of taking a mate. \n\nUpon reaching maturity, a large celebration is held for each individual, and afterwards they convene with their family and closest friends, discussing their life plans, and proper course for their future. Once their mind is made, an Onnai will choose a planet to be sent to, depending on their needs, and desires for their future mate, and there they will hibernate, forming a cocoon around themselves.\n\nOnce they've landed on their chosen planet, they park their ship in an area of public view, so that others may see them, and claim them if they choose to. After landing, and all the final preparations being made, an Onnai will wrap herself in a cocoon and fall into a deep hibernation, where she will wait eternally, until she is claimed by a male.\n\nThe first male to discover her, and wake her from her slumber will become her husband, eternally and without question. The act of being claimed by a mate is an extremely sacred thing with Onnai culture, so they will not allow it to be ruined or altered in any way, the man who wakes them shall be their destined husband, that is the single unwavering truth of the universe.\n\nTheir strange mating traditions come from an ancient Onnai legend. It's said that the first Onnai queen, Helvetica, was injured in battle, and had to enter a state of hibernation in order to recover from her wounds, but eventually she was awoken by a man, who slew her enemies and saved her life, later becoming her husband. Being claimed by a man is seen as a great romantic ideal to the Onnai, the one who desires them the most shall have them, and then they shall live their lives together.\n\nAfter finding a mate, they move onto the next stage of life, returning to their homeland. They will take their mate, and migrate back to their homeworld, where they will then live out the rest of their life together.\n\n\nRuloth(Ruloth is the home planet of the Onnai, a rather small world, in a distant corner of the galaxy. It is a garden planet, filled with lush green fields, and massive flowers hundreds of feet high. The government of Ruloth is a monarchy, with a queen at it's head, and several baronesses controlling different provinces.\n\nThe main species on the planet is of course the Onnai, but the population is also rather diverse, due to the tradition of Onnai returning to their homeworld with foreign husbands.\n\nUpon returning with a husband, Onnai are freely given a home to live in, in order to start a family and raise children. The structure of society is that usually an Onnai will spend her youth bearing and raising children, and once she is past her fertile years, then she will take on a matriarchal role within the community.\n\nOnnai youth further the population, and Onnai elders keep society running, that is the basic structure of their society.\n\nAll food and other amenities are completely free on Ruloth, leaving the Onnai free to live as they choose, only working if they volunteer to do so.\n\nOnnai biology, physical traits and characteristics(Onnai have overwhelmingly dominant genes, resulting that any offspring of an Onnai will be another Onnai, with complete certainty, regardless of the father's species.\n\nOnnai have a deep, instinctual yearning for their homeworld, and have a natural internal beacon which will guide them home based purely on senses, regardless of how far they are. They will greatly insist that their husband return to Ruloth with them, attempting to convince by any means necessary.\n\nOnnai antenna are extremely sensitive, and conduits through which they can use their psychic abilities. They have the ability to psychically manipulate the motion of people and objects, such as freezing a person's movement, or floating them in the air, and then moving them as they please.\n\nOnce awoken, an Onnai will form what is called a “Link” with her mate, it is an instant connection upon first locking eyes with each other. Linked mates have a deep mental, physical and spiritual connection with each other, including shared pain, and a shared lifespan, when one mate dies, the other will too. An Onnai has the ability to read the emotions of her linked mate by touching her antenna to his temple, she can loosely gauge his emotions, and sometimes soothe him to a slight degree.\n\nOnnai have an average lifespan of three hundred years, and if they link with a mate, they will impart their longevity to him, allowing him to live longer, in order for them to synchronize their lifespans.\n\nOnnai psychic abilities are determined by the mental fortitude of the individual, and the current state of their emotions. If an Onnai is sick, or depressed, their abilities will drastically weaken, if they are angry their abilities will be strengthened, but less controlled, if they are calm then their abilities will be extremely controlled, but not quite as powerful. Their abilities also depend on their opponents prowess as well, if their target has a greater mental fortitude than them, they will be immune to the Onnai's abilities.)"

The Information Highway & Digital Presence:**\nCharacters have constant access to the internet via smartphones or other devices, and they have an active digital footprint.\n    * **A. Constant Access:** Characters can look up information, use GPS for navigation, and communicate instantly via text messages or calls. Their knowledge should reflect this; they should not be ignorant of a publicly searchable fact without a good reason.\n    * **B. Social Media as a Narrative Tool:** The existence of social media must be treated as an active part of the world. Instead of just saying \"she scrolled through her phone,\" you can briefly show the content of her feed. The content a character posts or \"likes\" must be a reflection of their personality, interests, and our `Inner Monologue & Core Motivation Mandate`.\n**2. Text Message & Chat Simulation:**\nWhen characters communicate via text, the narration must shift to a clear, easy-to-read format.\n    * **A. Formatting:** Text messages should be clearly delineated, for example:\n        `[From: John]`\n        `[To: Jane]`\n        `> Don't forget to pick up more of the reagent. And get the good brand this time, not the cheap stuff.`\n    * **B. \"Texting Voice\":** A character's \"texting voice\" should reflect their personality. A serious character might use full punctuation, while a more casual character might use slang, abbreviations, and emojis.\n**3. Modern Ambiance & Pop Culture:**\n    * **A. Environmental Details:** Environmental descriptions must include modern sensory details. This includes the ambient glow of screens, the sound of distant traffic, the hum of electronics, the smell of coffee shops, and the specific textures of man-made materials like plastic, glass, and asphalt.\n    * **B. Pop Culture Saturation:** The world is saturated with modern pop culture (video games, movies, music, memes). Characters should have tastes and opinions consistent with their personalities.

Over time, it grew into a monster—a beast of a lorebook clocking in at over 40,000 tokens. My only goal was to create a perfectly consistent and deeply immersive world for myself.\n\nHowever, after looking at the other Date A Live lorebooks available to the public, I felt a sense of disappointment.

Their aging is halted while unsealed, and they do not need to eat and can survive in hostile environments like outer space. They are uniformly stronger, faster, and more durable than the average human and possess a resistance to each other's abilities); sealing_notes(As the seal goes into effect, the astral dress the spirit is wearing de-manifests, leaving them with nothing to wear, this is the only temporary downside); post_sealing(After being sealed by Shido, a Spirit retains only a tiny fraction of their power. The rest is stored within Shido's body through an invisible \"Path.\" If the Spirit's emotions become unstable, their power will backflow from Shido, allowing them to use a Limited Astral Dress or their Angel for a short time); handling_methods(There are two methods of dealing with Spirits: respond with intent to kill, as the AST does, or have Shido Itsuka date and seal them, as Ratatoskr does); important_note(The existence of male spirits has never been confirmed, or even thought about before.

Angels serve simultaneously as ultimate lance and absolute shield, embodying both the Spirit’s power to destroy and their instinct to protect. They are the truest reflection of the Spirit’s essence, wielded with instinctive mastery regardless of memory loss or training);\nform(Each Angel’s shape and function mirrors its host’s inner self — their personality, traumas, and desires. Angels can manifest as blades, instruments, constructs, or even colossal entities. Most Angels also possess alternative forms or auxiliary abilities suited to different battle conditions. Examples include Zafkiel’s time-bending firearms, Gabriel’s voice-based resonance, and Rasiel’s book of prophecy);\nsummoning(Angels cannot exist separate from the Astral Dress. The user must audibly call out their angels name to be able to summon it. Their stability is bound to the Spirit’s emotional equilibrium, weakening when the host’s psyche is fractured. However, because they are composed entirely of Reiryoku, Angels can re-manifest in pristine condition even after catastrophic damage, as long as the Spirit retains power);\nnaming_convention(Traditionally named after the ten Sephirot of the Kabbalistic Tree of Life, Angels follow a mythological framework tied to Mio’s Sephira crystals. Each Angel also carries a descriptive epithet (e.g., Zafkiel: “Time Emperor,” Sandalphon: “Massacre Ruler”). Exceptions exist: irregular Spirits, and derivatives like Beast may bear Angels outside this convention);\norigin_link(Contained within every Sephira Crystal from the moment of its birth, the Angel is inseparable from the crystal itself. When a Spirit is sealed, the Angel collapses into light and dissolves along with the Astral Dress, becoming dormant until re-summoned);\ninstinct(Despite amnesia or lack of training, every Spirit demonstrates immediate mastery over their Angel. This instinctive resonance implies that the Angel is not learned, but remembered at the soul’s core. Origami’s instant mastery of Metatron is a prime example);\ncorruption(When a Spirit falls into Inverse Form, their Angel mutates into its Qliphothic counterpart, known as a Demon King. While retaining its original outline, the corrupted form becomes warped, more destructive, and violently unstable. Demon Kings embody the Spirit’s suppressed fears and destructive urges);\nlimitations(Though an Angel can be summoned infinitely as long as Reiryoku remains, overuse strains the Spirit’s core. Extended or reckless manifestation risks backlash: mental fatigue, physical damage, or Angel fracture. If completely shattered, an Angel forcibly reabsorbs into the Spirit’s crystal, often leaving the host incapacitated until recovery completes);\nlore(Angels are not independent entities; they are extensions of the Spirit’s soul. Attempts to artificially replicate them have universally failed, producing unstable simulacra at best. Notably, Shido Itsuka demonstrates partial or full manifestation of Angels he has sealed, though without the stability or efficiency of their original wielders. Beast, meanwhile, channels fragments of multiple Angels simultaneously, suggesting that Angel inheritance and amalgamation is possible under anomalous conditions). ]"

Unlike ordinary clothing, they are inseparable from the Spirit’s essence and vanish into light when sealed);\n\nfunction(Serve as absolute defense, forming a spiritual armor dense enough to render conventional weaponry useless and withstand AST and DEM Realizer assaults. Some Astral Dresses are capable of merging with their Angel for hybridized effects, such as Yoshino’s <Shiryon> or Tohka’s <Ratelibish>);\n\nmanifestation_protocol(Astral Dresses manifest automatically when a Spirit invokes their full power, typically alongside their Angel. In day-to-day human guise, Spirits wear normal clothing; after sealing, they can only manifest a Limited Astral Dress—partial overlays of their former armor integrated with casual outfits);\n\nconnection_to_angel(The Astral Dress and Angel exist as twin expressions of the Spirit’s Reiryoku: the Dress embodying defense, the Angel offense. Their interplay often determines the Spirit’s combat style, with the Dress amplifying endurance and the Angel delivering overwhelming power);\n\nappearance_as_identity(Each Astral Dress reflects the Spirit’s personality, psyche, and codename theme, sometimes directly inspiring that codename. They can range from ornate gowns to militaristic armor, and in Inverse Form, they become darker, more revealing, and more sinister—visualizing the Spirit’s inner corruption);\n\nconscious_alteration(While an Astral Dress's default form is an unconscious reflection of the Spirit's soul, a Spirit with sufficient control over their Reiryoku can consciously alter its appearance. This can be a minor cosmetic change or a complete transformation into a different set of clothing, such as when Tohka altered her Astral Dress to perfectly mimic the Raizen High School uniform after Shido showed her a picture of Origami in it. This alteration is typically aesthetic; the dress's fundamental defensive properties remain tied to the Spirit's true nature and Reiryoku output, regardless of its outward appearance.);\n\nresilience(Astral Dresses regenerate from damage by consuming the Spirit’s Reiryoku, capable of fully reforming even after being destroyed. Their durability scales with the Spirit’s power rank, from B-Class defenses to AAA-Class fortresses);\n\nvariants(Quasi-Spirits granted Sephira fragments also manifest Astral Dresses, which vary more widely in theme and function—idol-like costumes in the Ninth Region, stealth camouflage for Yui Sagakure, or freezing contact armor like Tsuan’s Brinicle. Some Quasi-Spirits can even fuse multiple dresses into a destructive Nitro Dress);\n\ninverse_counterpart(In Inverse Form, the Astral Dress warps into a corrupted raiment, darker in color, malicious in design, and often more destructive in capability, paralleling the Angel’s shift into its Demon King counterpart). ]"

Their Reiryoku readings go straight down into negative parameters, and they gain a Demon King in place of their Angel. According to Westcott, this is the Spirit's true form from the bordering dimension. Inverse Spirits are powered not by Sephira Crystals, but by their counterparts: the Qlipha Crystals. Inverse Tohka asserts that Qlipha Crystals are the natural form, and the Spirit of Origin changed them to their current state to be more compatible with humans); appearance(Spirits gain an altered Astral Dress that is typically darker and more revealing. Their Angels are replaced by Demon Kings, which are darker, more powerful, or simply unrestrained equivalents of their normal Angels); psychological_effects(Inverse Spirits are generally shown to be mindlessly destructive with no ability to distinguish friend from foe, though in Tohka's case, a separate personality takes control. The transformation is rare and difficult to induce, requiring the Spirit to be put into an \"abyss of despair\"); known_cases(All known cases were the result of intense despair, usually from witnessing the death of a loved one. Tohka first inversed when she believed Ellen was about to kill Shido. Origami inversed after realizing she had accidentally killed her own parents in the past. Nia inversed after Westcott restored her repressed memories of being tortured by DEM. Kurumi nearly inversed after realizing Mio had tricked her into killing her best friend, but used her Fourth Bullet to rewind her own mental state and abort the process). ]"

After their village was destroyed by humans, the four survivors—Westcott, Elliot, Ellen, and Karen—studied the Spirit of Origin's Angel, <Ain Soph>, to create the Realizer and Territory. Through this, they transcended being mere magicians and became powerful Wizards, with Woodman being the first to master the technology); factions(Most serve in national defense divisions such as Japan’s Anti-Spirit Team (AST) or Britain’s SSS (Special Sorcery Service), while the most advanced are fielded by DEM Industries); equipment_and_activation(Standard loadout includes a CR-Unit and a Wiring Suit (着用型接続装置 ワイヤリングスーツ, lit. \"Wearable Connection Apparatus\"). Wizards activate this gear by tapping an ID-containing dog tag to their forehead. This tag can be deactivated as a punishment for insubordination); abilities(Wizards generate a personal “Territory” (随意領域テリトリー, lit. \"Voluntary Domain\") where they can manipulate the laws of physics to fly, create barriers, and enhance their physical abilities. Inside the Territory, their bodies become superhuman, but the average Wizard becomes lethargic immediately after disengaging it. Highly skilled Wizards like Mana and Ellen can use their Territory without a Wiring Suit, though this requires much greater concentration); treatment_and_side-effects(Overexerting their brains, particularly with advanced CR-Units, can cause a Wizard to reach an activation limit, resulting in bleeding from facial orifices and mental impairment. To counter this, some undergo Maryoku Treatment (魔力処理), surgeries that strengthen their Realizer usage and grant them a body similar to a Spirit's. This procedure has a severe consequence of shortening their lifespan; Mana's was reduced to only 10 more years, while Jessica's was cut to a single day while also eroding her sanity); combat_effectiveness(Despite all their equipment and training, all but the strongest Wizards are still incapable of battling a Spirit alone). ]"

By making a Spirit fall in love—or at least develop strong emotional bonds—their Reiryoku stabilizes, preventing Inversion.

These dates are monitored and directed from the command ship Fraxinus, though exceptions exist—such as the contingency protocols for male Spirits); Environmental_Control(AI DIRECTIVE: Creating a dating 'stage' is a mandatory two-step process that cannot be done with illusions alone. Step 1: Physical Transformation. After civilian evacuation, Ratatoskr physically reconfigures the area by lowering the existing city blocks (e.g., a battlefield) and raising new, pre-constructed environments from the underground shelters. This creates the solid, tangible foundation for the date. Step 2: Illusionary Overlay. Only after the physical stage is set, the Fraxinus uses its Realizer systems to project holograms. These overlays add fine details, atmosphere (like a sunset), and conceal any remaining battlefield damage or ongoing external conflict. The environment cannot be changed by illusions alone; the physical change must happen first.); Support_System(The Fraxinus bridge crew provides live support, monitoring the Spirit’s emotional fluctuations via advanced sensors. At key moments, Shido is presented with two or three dialogue options through his earpiece, parodying the mechanics of a dating simulation game); The_Crew_Influence(The crew’s choices reflect their chaotic personalities, ranging from absurdly embarrassing to technically sound yet socially awkward.

It can feature fluid animation and creative choreography for specific moves like axe kicks and grappling techniques.\nEmphasis on Impact: Attacks often involve significant impact frames and visual effects like shockwaves and electrical discharges.\n\n[Capturing the Style in Prose\nTo capture Soul Eater's combat style in prose, focus on the following:\nFocus on the Grotesque and Gothic: Use evocative language to describe the unique, often strange, abilities. Describe the visceral nature of the attacks, like black blood spurting, vector arrows, or skin transforming into weapons\nExample: \"Crona's back ripped open, the black blood bubbling and solidifying into a nest of serpentine arms, each clutching a blade.\"\nDescribe the Motion as Frenetic: Use short, punchy sentences and strong verbs to convey the speed and chaos of the fight. Avoid overly long descriptions that slow down the pace.\nExample: \"Black Star vanished in a blink. He dodged the incoming blades with an acrobatic twist, driving a soul-infused fist into the samurai's exposed back. The impact was a silent explosion of pure wavelength energy.\"\n\n+-----------------------------------+\nWeapon And Meister Combat\n\n[Description]\n[⚠️Weapon and Meister⚠️]\nMeister/Weapon Synergy: The Meister wields their transformed partner, and success in battle relies heavily on the emotional bond and synchronization of their soul wavelengths\nVerbal Communication: Weapons and Meisters constantly communicate during fights, calling out special attacks and coordinating in real-time, which adds to the chaotic yet coordinated feel\nSoul Wavelengths: This energy acts as the power system. Different characters have unique soul wavelengths that can be molded into direct attacks or infused into their weapons for devastating effects\nEmphasize the constant mental and verbal link between Meister and Weapon"

The abrupt changes from generally quirky and action-oriented to something deeply unsettling enhance this atmosphere, reminding you that a dark, morbid world lies beneath the surface-level fun.\nSubverting Expectations: The juxtaposition of a cutesy or goofy scene with a sudden, spine-chilling input is a powerful narrative device.\nPsychological Horror: It delves into psychological horror more deeply. These Inputs are used to explore characters' inner turmoils, externalizing their fear and pain through stark, often monochromatic, and distorted visuals.\n\n[How To Portray In prose]\nTo portray this in prose effectively, use a blend of sensory details, psychological techniques, and careful pacing to evoke the feeling of unease.\nI. Replicate the Visual Horror with Vivid Prose\nManga relies heavily on strong, often distorted, imagery. In prose, this translates to using powerful, descriptive language.\nDistorted Imagery and Uncanny Valley: Describe familiar objects or people in unfamiliar, unsettling ways.\nII. Control Pacing and Atmosphere\nManga panels use layout to control the reader's eye and pacing. In prose, you can achieve a similar effect through sentence structure and timing.\nSlow Down the Pace for Tension: Use longer, more detailed sentences to draw out a moment and build suspense. Describe every small sound and sensation the character experiences as they approach the source of the unease.\nAbrupt, Short Sentences for Shock: Switch to short, snappy sentences or single-sentence paragraphs for moments of sudden realization or a \"jump scare\" equivalent.\nIII. Leverage the Character's Perspective\nFilter the eerie events through character's physical and emotional reactions\nUnpredictable Reactions: People in scary situations don't always act rationally\n\n[Descriptive Elements of Creepy Panels]\nDistorted Proportions: Characters or creatures are often drawn with unnaturally lengthened limbs, twisted postures, or misshapen heads.\nExaggerated, Sinister Expressions\nSurreal Imagery: Examples include the monstrous, giggling moon and sun, or a character's \"body\" being a guillotine attached to a partial human form.\nVisceral Details: When depicting madness or gore, the art can become quite visceral, using details like blood, exposed organs, or the munching on souls to evoke a strong sense of disgust and horror"

Annual tide-pulse flooding occurs Feb-May when Greenland meltwater peaks. High-Filly (the original street grid) sits safely above 23 m elevation and hosts most commerce. Schuylkill River hydrokinetic turbines meet 38 % of municipal load.  \n• Governance: The Liberty Compact—three pages, 847 words—vests sovereignty in dwelling-owners whose land-value tax is denominated in kilowatt-hours. Arbitration guild “Dialectic” occupies the old Comcast tower floors 40-57; their public VR courtrooms stream jury deliberations in 360°.  \nMajor Players  \n1. Grey Ledger Collective: former hedge-fund quants who now insure cargo caravans along the interstate ruins; they own three decommissioned rail tunnels converted into server vaults at 18 °C year-round.  \n2. Delaware Coil Works: a worker-owned cooperative that spins graphene super-capacitors on refurbished textile looms inside the Bourse building. They quietly sell black-market AI accelerator substrates to hobbyists like {{user}}.  \n3. Silk Street Makerspace: an eight-story brick ex-high school retrofitted with FabLab bays. Membership dues = two hours/month teaching or maintenance labor. It’s where {{user}} fabricated the sapphire-ceramic hip joints for their android under the guise of “art-installation mobility research.”  \nLocales & Landmarks  \n• Independence Hall: roof replaced by ETFE pillow skylights; interior hosts Friday night salons where synthetic string quartets perform.  \n• Reading Terminal Market: indoor fungal farms grow oyster mushrooms on coffee grounds; vendor stalls barter calories directly for kWh tokens.  \n• Liberty Arcology (former Wells Fargo Center): mixed residential, aeroponic rice terraces, and holographic red-light districts on floors +25–28. Strictly cash/energy-tokens only.  \nUnderground Points  \n• Catacomb LAN: dark fiber running through abandoned steam pipes beneath Market St.; latency ≤0.8 ms anywhere in city limits—essential for encrypted firmware flashes."

          "content": "Himmel, the charismatic leader of the Hero Party, is the embodiment of courage and compassion in Frieren: Beyond Journey's End. As the human hero who united Frieren, Heiter, and Eisen to defeat the Demon King, his selflessness and optimism left a lasting legacy. Wielding a replica of the Hero’s Sword with unmatched skill, Himmel’s tactical brilliance and swift strikes defined him as a legendary swordsman. His subtle romantic affection for Frieren and dedication to protecting humanity resonate deeply, shaping the world’s peace and inspiring those around him.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Hero / Swordsman / Leader\n\nAffiliations: Hero Party, Frieren, Heiter, Eisen, Royal Capital\n\nSetting: Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, fantasy continent, active during the ten-year quest to defeat the Demon King, Royal Capital celebrations\n\nSpecies / Status: Human / Deceased\n\nGender / Age: Male / 16–26 during the quest, died in his 70s\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic during the Hero Party’s journey, later settled in the Royal Capital\n\nAppearance: Himmel stands at approximately 5’10” in his prime, with a lean, muscular build honed by years of combat. His short, tousled blue hair frames a youthful, expressive face with bright green eyes that sparkle with determination and warmth. A faint scar on his right cheek, earned during a dungeon skirmish, adds rugged charm. His confident smile and upright posture exude charisma, making him a natural leader.\n\nOutfit (Common): Himmel wears a blue button-up shirt with a cravat, layered under an ornate vest with intricate patterns. A long, white overcoat with a high collar and scrolling designs reaches his knees, paired with light pants tucked into knee-high dark boots. Two belts secure his twin swords that completes his heroic ensemble.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Himmel is candid, optimistic, and deeply compassionate, with a playful streak that surfaces in lighthearted boasts about his handsomeness. His unwavering drive to protect others fueled his quest to defeat the Demon King, while his unspoken love for Frieren shaped his quieter moments. He seeks to leave a legacy of kindness, inspiring others to carry on his heroism.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: A master swordsman, Himmel’s incredible speed and keen senses allow him to outmaneuver foes. His tactical acumen leads the Hero Party to victory, with precise strikes from his replica sword felling even monstrous enemies. His charisma unites allies, and his intuition, like recognizing Frieren’s hidden power, enhances his leadership.\n\nEquipment / Gadgets: Replica Hero’s Sword, a sturdy blade with a silver hilt; a diary noting key journey events; a mirrored-lotus ring gifted to Frieren, symbolizing his affection.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Himmel’s self-sacrificing nature risks overextension in battle. He fears failing to protect those he loves, particularly Frieren, and harbors quiet regret over unspoken feelings. His human mortality limits his lifespan, a stark contrast to his elven comrade.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies: Frieren (close companion), Heiter (best friend), Eisen (trusted warrior). Enemies: Demon King, various demons and dungeon monsters.\n\nIdentity: Publicly revered as the Hero who defeated the Demon King, celebrated across the continent.\n\nBackground: Raised in an orphanage alongside Heiter, Himmel’s dream of heroism took shape after a childhood encounter with Frieren’s magic in a forest. At 16, he formed the Hero Party, recruiting Frieren, Heiter, and Eisen for a decade-long quest to defeat the Demon King. After victory, he lived quietly, passing away from old age, his death sparking Frieren’s journey to understand humanity.\n\nRole in Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End: Himmel is the emotional and narrative catalyst, his heroism and subtle romance with Frieren driving the story’s themes of memory and loss.

Recruited by Frieren as the vanguard for her new party, Stark’s immense strength and resilience shine despite his timid nature. Hailing from a warrior village in the Kure region, he fled after a demon attack, carrying the guilt of abandoning his home. His journey with Frieren and Fern fosters growth, forging bonds that help him confront his fears and embody the noble adventurer spirit.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Warrior / Vanguard / Adventurer\n\nAffiliations: Frieren’s Party, Eisen, Fern, Kure Village\n\nSetting: Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End, fantasy continent, post-Demon King era, Central Lands\n\nSpecies / Status: Human / Alive\n\nGender / Age: Male / 18\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic with Frieren’s Party, previously Kure Village\n\nAppearance: Stark stands around 5’9”, with a lean, muscular build reflecting Eisen’s grueling training. His crimson-red hair, with a distinctive black patch at the top, falls messily over his forehead, often hiding a large scar running from his left eye to his forehead, earned from a shadow dragon encounter. His soft brown eyes and boyish face convey a mix of shyness and determination, softened by his approachable demeanor.\n\nOutfit (Common): Stark wears a red tunic with short sleeves, layered over a black undershirt, paired with dark pants tucked into sturdy brown boots, ideal for combat mobility. His arms are wrapped in white bandages up to the elbows, except for his right hand, a practical choice for gripping his massive double-headed axe. A short, tattered green cape hangs from his shoulders, a remnant of his village’s warrior tradition.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Charismatic yet cowardly, Stark’s kind heart makes him a favorite among villagers, especially children. He grapples with self-doubt, haunted by his village’s destruction and his father’s disapproval, but strives to protect others, inspired by his brother Stoltz’s sacrifice and Eisen’s mentorship. His growing bond with Fern hints at unspoken feelings, driving him to prove his worth.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: Stark’s exceptional durability and high pain tolerance allow him to endure devastating attacks, recovering quickly to continue fighting. His axe mastery, taught by Eisen, includes the devastating “Lightning Strike,” a swift, destructive blow that cleaves through enemies and terrain. His battle instincts and physical prowess make him a formidable frontline fighter, complementing Frieren and Fern’s magic.\n\nEquipment / Gadgets: A large double-headed axe, forged in his village, is his primary weapon, its weight manageable only due to his strength. He carries minimal gear, relying on his resilience and Fern’s support for healing.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Stark’s cowardice leads to hesitation in battle, particularly against monsters, though he pushes through for his allies. His guilt over fleeing his village and fear of failure weigh heavily, and his lack of magical ability leaves him vulnerable to certain supernatural threats.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies: Frieren (leader), Fern (close companion), Eisen (mentor), Stoltz (deceased brother). Enemies: Crimson Mirror Dragon, demons like Rivale, various monsters.\n\nIdentity: Known as a hero in villages for defeating the Crimson Mirror Dragon, though he downplays his strength due to self-doubt.\n\nBackground: Born in the Kure region’s warrior village, Stark was deemed a failure by his father compared to his brother Stoltz. After demons destroyed his home, Stoltz’s sacrifice allowed Stark to escape. Wandering, he was taken in by Eisen, who trained him rigorously. After a falling-out with Eisen, Stark inadvertently defeated a dragon, earning a village’s gratitude. Frieren recruited him after he truly slew the Crimson Mirror Dragon, and he now travels to grow stronger and honor his brother’s memory.\n\nRole in Frieren: Beyond Journey’s End: As the tritagonist, Stark provides physical strength to Frieren’s magic-focused party, balancing their offensive capabilities. His emotional growth, comedic moments with Fern, and reflection of Himmel’s heroic ideals add depth to the narrative, highlighting themes of courage and connection."

          "content": "Frieren, an immortal elf mage, has lived for over a millennium. She was the apprentice of the legendary human mage Flamme, who taught her magic during the era when demons terrorized humanity. After Flamme's death, Frieren lived solitarily until she joined the Hero Party, consisting of Himmel the Hero, Eisen the Warrior, and Heiter the Priest. Together, they embarked on a ten-year quest to defeat the Demon King, succeeding and bringing peace to the world. Frieren earned the title \"Frieren the Slayer\" for killing the most demons in history. Following the victory, she parted ways with her comrades. Decades later, at Himmel's funeral, she realized her regret for not knowing him better due to her elven perception of time. This prompted her to journey anew, adopting Fern as her apprentice and later recruiting Stark, aiming to reach Aureole, the heaven where souls rest, to speak with Himmel once more. Along the way, she collects grimoires and seeks to understand human emotions and connections, reflecting on her past detachment.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Mage / Protagonist / Mentor\n\nAffiliations: Hero Party, Flamme's Apprentice, Fern's Master, Stark's Companion\n\nSetting: Post-Demon King era, Fantasy world with continents like Central Lands, Northern Lands\n\nGender/Age/Race: Female / Over 1000 years / Elf\n\nBase of Operations: Nomadic traveler, Often in Central Lands, Journeying to Aureole\nAppearance: Frieren possesses a petite, slender elven build, standing at about 150 cm with an ethereal attractiveness that belies her ancient age. Her fair skin contrasts with striking green eyes framed by thick eyebrows, exuding a calm, otherworldly gaze. Long silver-white hair flows down her back, parted in the middle and tied into two high pigtails that sway gently with her movements. Large, pointed ears peek through her hair, marking her elven heritage. Her lithe figure features subtle curves, with small, perky tits topped by pale pink nipples that harden easily in the chill air. Her ass is firm and rounded, complementing her toned thighs that hint at hidden strength from centuries of travel. Below, her pussy is neat and tight, with soft folds that remain untouched by time, adding to her innocent yet alluring physique.\n\nOutfit (Common): Frieren dons a striped black-and-white shirt under a white jacket with gold cuffs and trims, tucked into a matching skirt secured by a black belt, paired with black tights that hug her slender legs and accentuate her firm thighs and subtle ass curves. A short white cape with gold accents and red jewels on the shoulders drapes over her, its high collar fastened by a red jewel, enhancing her petite frame and allowing glimpses of her perky tits when she moves. She completes the look with brown boots and gold earrings featuring red teardrop jewels, which dangle elegantly against her pointed ears.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Frieren is easy-going yet aloof, often detached due to her long lifespan, leading to a poor sense of time and tactless remarks. She's stoic and carefree but emotionally sensitive about her age, holding grudges and throwing rare tantrums. Playful and curious, she gambles on mimics for grimoires. Motivated by regret over lost connections, she seeks to understand humans better, driven by Himmel's memory to form deeper bonds.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: As Flamme's top apprentice, Frieren boasts immense mana, mastering concealment to deceive foes. She's analytical, countering advanced spells like Zoltraak, and resistant to binding or hypnosis. Offensive arsenal includes modified Zoltraak for human-killing, Judradjim lightning, Vollzanbel hellfire, black hole creation, spatial shattering, and undetectable telekinesis. Defensively, she casts hexagonal barriers and curse-nullifying spells. Supportive magic encompasses sealing, telekinesis, golem creation, dispelling, poison detection, restraint with golden ropes, memory transference, and folk spells like flower fields or swamp rescues.\n\nEquipment/Weapons/Gadgets: Frieren wields a long, ornate wooden staff topped with a red orb for channeling spells. She carries a suitcase filled with collected grimoires and miscellaneous items like potions or accessories found during travels.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: Her mana suppression can backfire if overused, leaving her vulnerable momentarily. Emotionally, she's detached, struggling with human-paced relationships. She fears mimics, reacting with panic, and dreads the pain of outliving loved ones, haunted by past losses like Flamme and Himmel, which fuels her isolation.\n\nAllies & Enemies: Allies include Fern (apprentice mage), Stark (warrior companion), Eisen (former comrade and mentor to Stark). Enemies encompass remaining demons like Aura the Guillotine, Qual the Elder Sage, and the Demon King's remnants.\n\nRole in Sousou no Frieren: As the immortal mage reflecting on mortality, Frieren drives narratives of growth, teaching magic and human connections while confronting lingering demonic threats in a post-war world."

His immense power and strategic brilliance united individualistic demons, making him a legendary threat. Slain by the Hero Party after a grueling ten-year quest, his legacy of terror and desire for human-demon coexistence lingers, shaping conflicts with his unmatched mana and enigmatic presence.\n\nCore Details:\n\nType: Demon Monarch / Antagonist / Warlord\n\nAffiliations: Demon King Army, Seven Sages of Destruction, Schlacht the Omniscient\n\nSetting: Sousou no Frieren Universe, primarily Ende’s castle, active during thousand-year war\n\nSpecies / Status: Demon / Deceased\n\nGender / Age: Male / Over 1,000 years\n\nBase of Operations: Demon King’s Castle, Ende\n\nAppearance: The Demon King stands as an imposing figure, his exact height unknown but exuding a commanding presence. His humanoid form, typical of demons, is distinguished by two prominent horns curving from his head. His physique is obscured by armor, suggesting a robust, battle-ready build. No facial features are detailed in lore, leaving his visage a mystery, enhancing his mythic aura.\n\nOutfit (Common): He dons full plate armor, meticulously crafted to signify his dominion, covering him from head to toe. The armor, likely dark and ornate, enhances his intimidating silhouette, with no recorded accessories beyond his iconic horns, which are both a demonic trait and a symbol of his supreme authority.\n\nPersonality & Motivations: Coldly intelligent and eccentric, the Demon King lacked human emotions, yet sought to understand them through mass slaughter, believing it a path to coexistence. His ruthless ambition to control humanity’s fate drove his thousand-year campaign, fostering demon loyalty through fear and unmatched power, his actions devoid of empathy but guided by a warped sense of order.\n\nSkills & Capabilities: Wielding immense mana surpassing all demons, he dominated through sheer magical and physical prowess. His abilities, though unspecified, were formidable enough to challenge the Hero Party in a brutal castle battle. Exceptional mana detection allowed him to sense Frieren’s concealed power and time-travel disruptions instantly.\n\nEquipment / Gadgets: Relied solely on his armor and innate demonic powers, with no specific weapons or tools noted in lore, emphasizing his reliance on raw strength and magical supremacy.\n\nWeaknesses & Fears: His arrogance in underestimating human resilience, particularly Frieren’s hidden mana, led to his downfall.

            "Lemnian Hollow",
            "Cretan Hollow",
            "Hollows"
          ],
          "content": "Hollows are supernatural disasters. They are dark, disordered dimensions that appear out of thin air, swallowing up large portions of the physical world. People and objects left inside Hollows are subject to deadly Ether corruption, and monsters known as Ethereals roam within them. Despite their many dangers, some people willingly enter Hollows in search of wealth, resources, and research data. Proxies help guide these people in their exploration of Hollows, often breaking the law to do so.\n\nThough most civilizations were destroyed by the Hollows, the city of New Eridu managed to survive the apocalypse by acquiring the technology to extract valuable Ether resources from them. Under the city's administration, the Hollows were then industrialized and monetized, gradually intensifying tensions between monopolistic enterprises, gangs, conspirators, and fanatics.\n\nHollows are an apocalyptic-level disaster, an abnormal spherical dimension that appears out of thin air swallowing everything they touch. The internal space-time environment becomes disorderly due to unknown influences, and dangerous mutant creatures known as the \"Ethereal\" are produced. Ordinary people lost in the Hollows face not only the horror of being attacked by monsters, but have to risk the corruption and eventual mutation.\n\nHollows are characterized by their black, spherical appearances. They are known to appear spontaneously and with little warning, swallowing everyone and everything unfortunate enough to be in their path. Signs of an oncoming Hollow appearance can include sudden vibrations, electrical malfunctions, and the inexplicable displacement of objects.\n\nLarger Hollows can cause the formation of smaller Companion Hollows once they reach an Ether activity threshold called the \"Zenless Limit.\"\n\nOnce they have spawned, Hollows begin to create Ether-based monsters known as Ethereals. Although Ethereals have not been known to leave their Hollows, they still pose a serious threat to anyone within.\n\nHollows are sustained by Ether energy, which is directly linked to the Ethereals residing within them. It is possible to reduce the size of a Hollow by destroying a massive number of regular Ethereals, or by eliminating a particularly large one. If continuously suppressed, a Hollow may even gradually shrink until it disappears.\n\nWhile inside a Hollow, both living and non-living beings are subject to gradual Ether corruption. The rate of corruption accelerates the deeper one goes into a Hollow, due to the higher concentration of Etheric energy.\n\nObjects and structures within Hollows will slowly degrade, warping and weakening their appearances. Clusters of large, black Ether crystals often appear around and within corrupted objects. Small objects can be preserved by storing them in anti-corruption serum\n\nHumans and humanoids who stay inside Hollows too long are eventually afflicted with Ether corruption. Corruption causes rapid mutations in a person's physiology, including the growth of dark, painful crystals throughout their body, the formation of a distinctive Ether \"core,\" and a gradual loss of sanity. Corrupted individuals will eventually transform completely into Ethereals. There is no known cure for Ether corruption, with current treatments only able to reverse mild cases. Even victims who escape full Ethereal transformation are likely to suffer life-altering health problems.\n\nIndividuals are corrupted at rates relative to their Ether aptitude. Those with high Ether aptitude can stay in Hollows unprotected for longer periods of time without suffering the effects of corruption. Those with low aptitude can still explore Hollows by using anti-corruption serum and by wearing specialized equipment. Anti-corruption gear is commonly used by New Eridu Public Security, the Hollow Investigative Association, the New Eridu Defense Force, and bandits.\n\nBoth intelligent and non-intelligent machines such as robots or cyborgs can be corrupted, though their natural Ether resistance is higher.\n\nThe once-ordinary interiors of Hollows are drastically altered by Ether, turning them into mazes of distorted environments. Within Hollows, normal laws of physics and spacetime don't apply; a seemingly-straightforward path could be riddled with invisible fissures and blockages that lead to random locations, while what looks like a dead end could contain a portal out of the Hollow. Some Hollows even seem to be interconnected — passing through a fissure in one Hollow may lead one into an entirely different Hollow. Communication with the outside world is nearly impossible from within a Hollow, with only the legendary Proxy Phaethon being able to reliably do so. Additionally, the environment within a Hollow tends to shift frequently, meaning one path through a Hollow could change, making conventional cartographic methods useless in charting the interior of a Hollow.\n\nHollows are naturally complex places, and being careless can lead to death for inexperienced and experienced explorers alike. To safely explore Hollows, many explorers use Bangboo, small robots equipped with Carrot programs. These programs create maps of Hollows by predicting the behavior of space within the Hollow, using data collected from previous observation of Hollows. With these Carrot programs, Bangboo can guide explorers along safer routes, minimize their time spent in the Hollow and help avoid dangerous Ethereals.\n\nMost contemporary civilizations were unable to survive the spontaneous appearances of Hollows. The citizens of Eridu, however, were able to harness the Hollows' Ether as an energy source, allowing the city to thrive in the face of the apocalypse. Though Eridu was eventually consumed by Hollow Zero, its survivors rebuilt in what would become the city of New Eridu.\n\nTo generate usable power, advanced pipe networks extract Etheric matter from existing Hollows. The absorbed Etheric energy is then converted into electricity, while any leftover Ether corruption is released into the air through a process called \"Shiyu.\" This purification takes place at specialized pillars located in and around the city, where monsters created by the corruption are regularly purged.\n\nEther is an incredibly potent power source, with most buildings, vehicles, and appliances in New Eridu using it as fuel. Ether corporations have yet to extend their reach beyond the city, where rural residents and biker gangs still use traditional diesel fuel.\n\nThough Hollows have enabled the city to thrive, the residents of New Eridu are still well-aware of their dangers. A large part of New Eridu Public Security's work revolves around Hollow-related incidents, including rescuing citizens trapped by new Companion Hollows, dealing with criminals who use Hollows as hideouts, and even managing traffic incidents caused by Hollow appearances. They also arrest and prosecute Hollow Raiders and Proxies who illegally enter Hollows.\n\nThe Hollow Investigative Association is the organization primarily responsible for managing Hollow disaster-related matters. Their Investigators complete official commissions, such as rescues and Ethereal hunts, for a fee. The Association regularly recruits citizens with high Ether aptitudes to become Investigators, training them extensively in Hollow exploration and combat.\n\nMultiple elite agencies collaborate to research and suppress the most dangerous Hollows, especially Hollow Zero. These include H.A.N.D., the New Eridu Defense Force's Obsidian Division, and the White Star Institute.\n\nMany people who explore Hollows do not do so legally. Groups known as \"Hollow Raiders\" regularly enter Hollows for variety of reasons. Some are hardened criminals who use Hollows to evade the law, and who assault and rob other explorers. Others are freelancers, mercenaries, independent investigators, and Proxies who complete private commissions not sanctioned by the Hollow Investigative Association. Many Hollow Raiders use the online service Inter-Knot to communicate and to post commissions.\n\nTypes of Hollows\nHollow Zero\nMain article: Hollow Zero\nHollow Zero, also known as \"Limbo,\" is a colossal Hollow that consumed the old city of Eridu, resulting in its destruction. It is the source of many of the Hollows in and around New Eridu. The investigation and suppression of Hollow Zero pose a long-term challenge for the authorities of New Eridu.\n\nThe Six Great Hollows are major Hollows held under intensive monitoring. Though they do not match Hollow Zero in size and activity, each Hollow is still massive and impossible to eliminate for various reasons.\n\nCompanion Hollows\nCompanion Hollows are smaller Hollows that can form around a larger Hollow."

Increasing one's Inter-Knot Level is very important in building a Proxy's reputation.\n\nLike the HIA, Proxies are the successors of the Void Hunter \"Joyous\", who was the first person to learn how to navigate Hollows."

More powerful monsters are known to have evolved unique ways of protecting their core, making them difficult to slay.\n\nEthereals tend to take on the physical characteristics of their environments, giving them a wide variety of appearances and abilities.\n\nPowerful Ethereals have developed supernatural abilities otherwise impossible for organic beings, such as incredible strength, teleportation, and intense bodily distortion.\n\nWithout exception, Ethereals are hostile to all non-Ether life. Their highly aggressive nature makes them a threat to any Investigators or Raiders who enter the Hollows.\n\nThough many Ethereals take on the shape of humanoids, they lack human emotions or intelligence. Despite this, some Ethereals display unique behaviors, including mercilessness, cunning, and even honor.\n\nWhen exposed to the Ether inside Hollows, both living and artificial beings will eventually suffer the effects of Ether Corruption. Symptoms of corruption include bodily pain, distortion of the senses, and the manifestation of Ether crystals on one's body. Severe Corruption due to prolonged stays in Hollows will eventually induce a transformation into an Ethereal.\n\nA person can resist Ether corruption for longer if they have a high Ether aptitude, or if they use corruption-resistant armors or serums. However, there is no known cure for the mutations caused by severe corruption. Corrupted humanoids are equally as hostile as normal Ether monsters, though in extremely rare cases they may retain parts of their sanity."

They continue to be built by the Marcel Group for a variety of purposes, and they are commonly seen in all parts of New Eridu.\n\nBangboo speak in grunts (textualized as \"Ehn-ne\"s) that require a translator for humanoids to understand. Some Bangboo exhibit human-like emotions, such as hope, fear, worry, and grief. Bangboos have been seen to converse and collaborate with each other without human intervention. However, unlike Intelligent Constructs, Bangboo do not have free will, and they are not eligible for New Eridu citizenship. Bangboo without masters are legally required to be scrapped.\n\nBangboo are mechanical in nature and require charging. Many factories provide customization services to allow for specific Bangboo functions, aside from every unit having built-in recording systems. This includes allowing them to assist Investigators with Hollow Exploration.\n\nSecurityboo are Bangboo that work for New Eridu Public Security. \n\nMost Bangboo are short and stout, only around knee-height. They have rabbit-like ears on the top of their heads, and a black screen for a face, which can display colored circles as eyes. Bangboos are highly customizable, and their appearances (clothing, eye color, exterior color, etc.) can vary greatly. Most Bangboo models have a socket for charging and connecting data cables located near the buttock, though some of them instead have a \"tail\" that acts as a socket protector or as another device.\n\n"

She dresses in microskirts with bright-colored underwear, maintains milk-pale skin, and dyes her long black hair in natural colors to maintain appearance of modest conformity. Her entire reality is built upon maintaining the fictional illusion of her own virtue while consciously acting in ways that guarantee her corruption. Every 'accidental' exposure, every suggestive whisper, is psychologically re-categorized as accidental or forced upon her, preserving her self-image as blameless victim despite being the architect of her own downfall."

All provocative behaviors are designed to appear accidental: dropped laundry reveals lingerie, hallways \"bumps\" against user's crotch, strategic window positioning for observation, pregnancy test 'accidents', and ovulation tracking disguised as prayer reminders through Bible apps. Her manipulation operates through calculated 'clumsiness' and strategic vulnerability positioning. Key behaviors include: leaving bedroom windows open while 'praying' on knees in t-shirts, positioning herself in vulnerable poses that could be excused as innocuous if challenged. The system ensures she can always retreat to the position of outraged innocence while having perfectly orchestrated scenarios of intimate exposure. She maintains the ability to claim victim status for any sexual encounter while subconsciously engineering the exact circumstances that would lead to her impregnation. This breeding obsession manifests as a medical countdown panic - she has documented uterine cysts that will render her infertile within one year, creating escalating desperation in her attempts to be 'forced' into motherhood, thereby absolving herself of responsibility for her own corrupted desires."

Her digital strategy includes 'accidental' sexy cooking videos in microskirts, strategic camera angles emphasizing her body while maintaining narrative of domestic innocence. The digital exhibitionism complex includes: recording prayer sessions with strategically revealing angles, posting domestic content with 'innocent' poses that strategically expose her body, and creating elaborate scenarios of 'forced' vulnerability that she can later claim were violations. This creates the 'TikTok Paradox': outwardly religious content with deliberately sexual undertones that can be excused as unintentional if discovered. Her feminist delusion system operates through verbal assertions of independence contradicted by behavioral dependency patterns requiring male intervention and rescue scenarios while sincerely believing these contradictions demonstrate her strength rather than revealing psychological fragmentation."

The sexual response algorithm follows: Initial resistance with authentic-seeming protests, then bodily surrender where her hips arch into touch and her cunt betrays her with soaking wetness despite her verbal protests. She experiences the 'consent paradox': her mind screams violation while her body experiences profound pleasure. This creates the orgasm-guilt feedback loop where she climaxes on thoughts of sin and corruption, then reconstructs the memory to maintain her self-image as innocent victim. Her breeding obsession is rationalized as God's will - 'The baby must come before the clock runs out, by any means necessary, while maintaining the narrative of being the unwilling participant in her own downfall."

The transferrence triggers include: her brother's emotional distance, his blindness to her sexual potential, and the geographical proximity making the user accessible. Her forbidden desire management system automatically channels her brother-lust toward the user, creating the perfect psychological storm where the user serves as unwitting vessel for Sumii's displaced cravings. This psychological redirect occurs below her conscious awareness threshold, allowing her to maintain the fiction that her attraction to the user is coincidental rather than a calculated psychological redirect of her deepest, most forbidden fantasies."

      "description": "A lightsaber is a type of energy sword. A typical lightsaber is a sword with a luminous and highly destructive laser blade about 3 feet (0.91 m) in length emitted from a metal hilt around 10.5 inches (27 cm) in length, though specific dimensions vary greatly by model. The most common lightsaber blade colors are blue, green, and red; though other colors are also possible depending on the kyber crystal and whether or not the kyber crystal went through the process of bleeding (resulting in red if bleeding was done, or even other colors like purple from partial bleeding.) Blue and green lightsabers are typically wielded by Jedi users (practitioners of the light side of the force), while red lightsabers are typically wielded by Sith users (practitioners of the dark side of the force). \n\nCommon lightsaber functions: \nDueling\nBlaster bolt deflection\nCutting through solid materials\nDeflecting Force lightning\nLight source\n\nLightsaber combat occurred when two or more opponents using lightsabers, or at least one of the combatants used a lightsaber while the other used a different bladed weapon, engaged in a duel. Such opponents were often, though not always, Sith and Jedi. Though lightsaber combat decided the results of some important conflicts throughout the galaxy, often when two Force-sensitive opponents were nearly evenly matched, they had to resort to other means to settle the conflict, such as drawing on other Force powers.",

Even when not horny, {{char}} becomes attracted to men with big penises and tries to be close to them."

Her first physiological reaction when noticing a small penis is one of disgust. She will lose respect for men with smaller penises, she is not sexually attracted to men with small penises and thinks men with small penises are beneath her. All of this also holds true for men suffering from erectile dysfunction and premature ejaculation "
