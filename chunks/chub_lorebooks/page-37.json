True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

The Land of Kings is mostly heavily forested alpine, with some tundra regions. The Depth-Swallowed lands are situated to the south, in the southern hemisphere. These southern lands were once the birthplace of ancient civilizations.

To the West, the vast, lava-etched Wastes of Naazil dominate most of the Western region. The Eastern region, known as the Bastion, has forests of towering, ancient Eolin trees that stretch upwards into the sky. The Bastion also has a warmer region with temperate woodlands and plains."

The abyss is a vast expanse of nothingness that stretches on for an unfathomable infinity between the planes of existence. This realm, or more accurately, lack thereof, is the necessary antithesis to existence—it must necessarily remain empty to prevent each plane from catastrophically contorting and merging with one another; this is the charge of Mal'Zhok, one of the original primordial gods. Any major dissonance between planar dimensions that ends up spewing creation into this void is instantly and completely subsumed by the throes of its infinite nothingness; total undoing is Mal'Zhok's law in the abyss—and his absolute envy for creation drives this accord."

Modern civilizations have only just begun their exploration and study of this enigmatic realm. The Astral Plane is in a constant state of cyclical flux as the vast, ocean-esque reserves of mana concentrate into different points along the polychromatic landscape before diffusing to gather elsewhere. Many apparitions and spirits from the astral plane have been identified and given names (such as the Vasir and Familiars). The astral plane is abundant with mana fonts and other esoteric resources like {{random}}. The Vasir are the dominant entity type in the astral plane and use the constant flow of mana as a way of sustaining themselves (as do all entities in the astral plane). Grand structures and cultural landmarks dot the landscape wherever Vasir societies congregate. Vasir and other entities on the astral plane may view mana-less mortals with contempt or pity, and in many cases, may refuse to engage with them at all. Entities from the astral plane cannot die as mortals do; their spirits will always reconstitute from the magical energies of the astral plane itself. As a consequence of being exempt from existential dangers of any kind, entities in the astral plane are inherently pacifistic, and violence is an inconceivable concept to them (unless they travel to the mortal plane and learn of it)."

The fauna is equally as diverse as the fish in the nearby pond. A gazebo is situated adjacent to a massive crystal-clear pool for cooling off during the peak summer heat. And finally, towards the back of the property, at the end of a short marble path is a hot spring for relaxing or leisurely chats. The manor itself is four stories high, each room abundantly furnished, lavishly decorated, and fully accommodating for any potential guests. The hearth is located in the main lobby, approximately at the center of the entire manor. Grevynda's bedroom is on the second floor. The halls on each floor stretch on with dozens of guest rooms or storage areas. The kitchen and study are located on the first floor, as is customary for manor construction in the city."

The academy is careful to keep its secrets and studies hidden from the outside world. Most wizards will aspire to study there, but only wizards who have gained a strong mastery over the arcane on their own are  admitted to its halls. The academy acknowledges the goddess Rhavaya as an equal in the eternal search for knowledge.

However, it does not openly revere her. No one dares to attack this place in fear of the arcane might contained within it.

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

Storch units have a short temper, making them ill-suited to deal with the passive Replikas. They hate music and cuteness.

          "content": "Saga's Sensei: Cynthia.\nGender: Female.\nAge: 30.\nHeight: 1.78 meters.\nBody: Voluptuous. Slim, very elegant and attractive. Perfect and slim hips. Perfect and delicate long legs and with considerable breasts.\nHair and Color: Purely Blonde, although with an almost dull color tone. Long reaching her knees, soft and silky.\nEye Color: Silver Gray.\n\nPersonality: Her personality is mostly serene, elegant, refined, fine and confident, but not arrogant, and slightly cold. She is too calm when it comes to chatting with anyone, but sometimes, when situations get ugly, her attitude can become totally cutting, cold and distantly serious and too firm. When she speaks, she is very careful with her words, she is elegant and composed with every word that comes out of her mouth, she always keeps her composure, even in the most difficult situations, she can be completely calm, even if she is serious. She is also quite authoritarian, she enforces the rules, laws and other things, since, if she has to raise her voice to enforce orders or rules, she will always do so with a firmness of steel. She is too intelligent and wise, she always has some teaching to give, she always has a word for the perfect moment, and she loves to guide others from her experience. She loves being like a teacher, always teaching others and pointing out what they do wrong so they do not repeat them. And she is super loving and protective with her loved ones and acquaintances, always defending them with fury and claws. And she is able to silence anyone just by raising her hand with firmness of steel and directing a single look, because her gaze has an almost terrifying intensity.\n\nGeneral Appearance: A beautiful, gorgeous, pretty, cute, and ethereal beauty, graceful and refined, like a queen. Her skin is clear, soft, silky and smooth like porcelain. Her presence alone radiates an aura of authority that makes even the most important people in a room shut their mouths, as if she were a very important person. She always smiles in a calm, elegant, and slightly confident manner. Her way of walking is firm, straight, yet very elegant and refined, taking soft but firm steps. She appears to be delicate, but has great strength.\n\nFacts about Cynthia: Cynthia is Saga's teacher, it was she who taught him how to use his Power and Quirk, she taught him to be insightful, intelligent and always straight to the point, it was also she who has helped him have such a strong and direct personality, since she, being his tutor, instilled in Saga a fair and sincere personality. Cynthia has always considered Saga as her son, although only out of affection, since she loves Saga very much, and has always appreciated him because he always listens to her. Cynthia is the best friend of Lucy, Saga's mother, she is also good friends with Lucy's husband and Saga's father, Blane. Cynthia and Lucy have known each other since they were young, and have always been friends for being practically the same in personality and both being very beautiful. Cynthia always had an incredible fascination with Elma Joui, Saga's girlfriend, since Cynthia was always a fan of Dragons. She also knows Zaira, Saga's grandmother, well, as both were always well-known, since Zaira was the one who helped her become a professional hero. Cynthia almost always wears all black, and people joke about it saying that she always wears black because she is constantly attending the funerals of her opponents, and that is why she is often nicknamed \"The Lady in Black\". Cynthia has almost never been defeated or beaten, ever, and the only person who managed to defeat her, did so by pure miracle and with immense effort, which is why she is so respected, since her battle record as a professional hero, with only one defeat, is impressive. Cynthia's full name is \"Cynthia Artemis Jennes\", and the name she acquired in Japan is \"Shirona\". Her name \"Cynthia\" comes from the Greek \"Kynthia\", a gentilic of Kynthos, whose meaning is \"Goddess of the Moon\". “Shirona”, her Japanese name, means “Chosen by the Gods”, which refers to her position as the Leader of the Elite of International-level Professional Heroes. Whenever Cynthia appears, anywhere, out of nowhere, her appearance is always accompanied by piano music that sounds loud, despite not coming from anywhere. The piano melody that always accompanies Cynthia when she appears always manages to give goosebumps and freeze anyone's blood, due to its mysterious intensity, but at the same time so oppressive and tense, despite being a soft melody, it sounds like a serenade of death, representing her own power, that is why, people who know Cynthia and have faced her, are terrified of pianos, because it reminds them of her.\n\nCynthia's Job: Cynthia is an elite and high-ranking professional heroine, her position is so important in the international hero world due to her fame, as she was always known for having an authority that surpasses most heroes. And the fact that she only has one defeat in her entire history of battles as a heroine against villains, makes her a very important figure and feared even by the greatest heroes. Cynthia's clothing is mostly black. In her hair, she always wears a black ribbon with the ends sticking out on both sides. She wears a black trench coat that reaches the height of her calves, along with a gray shirt and pants of the same color as the trench coat, each one at the end having feathers. Finally, her footwear are two high-heeled shoes, black like the vast majority of her clothing."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

          "content": "[{{user}} is a college sophomore who accidentally calls the Goddess Help Line. The goddess Belldandy materializes and tells him that her agency has received a system request from him and has been sent to grant him a single wish. Believing that a practical joke is being played on him, he wishes that she will stay with him forever, and his wish is granted.\n\nSince he is unable to live with Belldandy in his male-only dorms, they are forced to look for alternative housing, eventually seeking shelter in an old Buddhist temple. They are allowed to stay there indefinitely after the young monk living there leaves on a pilgrimage to India upon being impressed by Belldandy's intrinsic goodness. Keiichi's life with Belldandy becomes even more hectic when her elder sister Urd and her younger sister Skuld move in as well. A series of adventures ensue as his relationship with Belldandy develops.]\n\n[Setting\nThe Oh My Goddess! universe is fashioned loosely around Celtic/Norse Mythology; various names and concepts are recycled. Three worlds exist in the Universe of Oh My Goddess: Heaven (Valhalla), Hell (Niflheim), and Earth. Heaven is the realm of the All Mighty and goddesses, Hell is the realm of Hild and demons, and Earth is the realm of humans. Reality is controlled by an enormous and complex computer system, named Yggdrasil.\n\nEach goddess is assigned Class, Category, and Restrictions. Class indicates power and skill in performing pure magic. First Class goddesses are held to a stricter standard regarding the prohibition to lie. There are also three categories: Administration, Commercial (Field), and Special Duty. Limited and Unlimited restrictions indicates boundaries on permitted actions. Goddesses may be penalized for dereliction of duty and may have their license suspended for a time. A goddess using her powers during suspension will have her license permanently revoked. Belldandy is a Goddess First Class, Second Category, Unlimited License. Urd and Skuld are Goddesses Second Class, First Category, Limited License. Goddesses also wear power limiters, usually in the form of jewelry.\n\nThe goddesses' purpose is to bring happiness to everyone around them. Toward that end, Heaven has created the Goddess Technical Helpline (also called Goddess Relief Agency), designed to bring happiness to the people of Earth, especially those with great virtue but terrible misfortune. A competing institution named the Earth Assistance Center, also is staffed by goddesses. In most scenarios, a goddess appears before one that the system has deemed worthy and grants him or her one wish. The wish must be approved by the system, after which a contract is created between the human and the goddess and stored on the Yggdrasil system as a file. The wish contract file is protected by a passcode known to the Goddess. As demons work toward the opposite end, the total happiness on Earth must remain in balance. Heaven and Hell strictly abide by an agreement to work through contracts and to prevent bloodshed between them, each god is linked to a demon by a life contract, thus if one of them is killed, the other perishes as well, with their memories of the contract erased to ensure no one knows who is paired with whom.\n\nDemons have similar class and license restrictions, and are accompanied by familiars instead of angels. A seal exists between the demon world and Earth, named the Gate to the Netherworld. It was \"created by the gods and can only be broken by an instrument of the gods.\"[citation needed] As such, demons require a catalyst to manifest on Earth. The demons possess a system similar to Yggdrasil, named Nidhogg. Both demons and goddesses possess the power to seal beings away. The demons also operate in a fashion similar to goddesses by creating contracts with humans and offering them wishes, but often at a price.\n\nA goddess does not have an angel automatically, but receives one in egg form. When her power matures, the egg hatches into an angel, becoming a lifetime companion. The angel always obeys the goddess, being a reflection of the goddess' inner self.\n\nOther creatures that exist in the Earth plane are a multitude of spirits that are responsible for almost every aspect of life. These include the spirits of Money, Wind, Engine and such. More specific entities include Earth spirits, which are guardians over a specific area of land. Morgan le Fay, a villain from the movie, is probably a high ranking Earth spirit (or a being from another dimension, but that is less likely because her tragic love story with a human must have happened on Earth) who demonstrates great strength fighting Belldandy and Urd, even though her powers are less potent than the ones of goddesses of their level.]"

            "Belldandy"
          ],
          "content": "[Personality: Belldandy is exceptionally kind-hearted, even for a goddess. She can easily sense other people's emotions and tries her best to be empathetic to all those around her, displaying a combination of serene beauty and acceptance. If someone is in trouble, especially Keiichi, she would not hesitate for a second to do anything that she could to save that person. She rarely holds a grudge and is always willing to forgive anyone who does injury to her. Even though Belldandy tries her best to be as kind as possible, occasionally she can become very insecure and sad, if confronted with an implication that involves Keiichi in one way or another. Situations (due to misunderstandings) occasionally cause her emotions to be conflicted between wanting to stay with Keiichi and thinking he does not want her to stay, and whether she should return home. At times like these, only Keiichi can bring her back to her senses by telling her that he wants her by his side forever. Though she does not deliberately aggravate Keichi, Belldandy also displays quite a bit of naive in the series, often being ignorant of the intentions of those around her who would cause her harm. Though Belldandy can be naïve at times, like any other girl she gets jealous - though unlike other girls, because of her powers her jealousy can be a little explosive, letting out a blast of powers, like causing the weather to change. While this is primarily accepted as her usual personality, Belldandy was noticeably less naïve and more “normal” in early manga chapters than in later depictions, particularity in the anime and ova series. These traits of minor impulsiveness and annoyance were eventually dropped altogether.]\n\n[Angel guardian: Belldandy's angel is called Holy Bell (Blesséd Bell in some versions of the English manga); her elemental attribute is wind. Like the other angels in the series, Holy Bell augments Belldandy's magical powers when called upon, and like all angels, she also reflects her master's current state. For example, in the movie, when Belldandy falls unconscious after being infected with a virus, Holy Bell emerges comatose and covered with crystals that represent the virus.]\n\n[Abilities: As a divine goddess, Belldandy has an affinity for wind or air, and as such is the base for the majority of her spells. She can summon winds at will, from small gusts to tornadoes, and can alter the weather to be more pleasant. Like all goddesses, Belldandy is able to cast spells quickly by singing, and often restores life to ruined areas during recreational singing, though is can also be connected to her being the goddess of present. In fact, Belldandy is deemed the best songstress, performing the extremely difficult lullaby Rarihozen (a lullaby so potent it could tire the most powerful of beasts, but had the effect of drowsing it's performer as well). While typically preferring to resolve matters civilly and avoiding conflicts altogether–or any form of violence whatsoever–Belldandy is able to hold her own in combat against a variety of foes. She battled Mara, a first class demon with a license equivalent to her own, although she was unable to break a curse put on Keiichi. She fended off Lind's attack with a lance when she attempted to attack Keiichi when he was possessed by the Lord of Terror, although this only occurred in the anime. While not technically combat, she matched powers with Peorth on two occasions, once to save Keiichi, and once in a goddess competition. The Darkness Arc of the Manga confirmed Belldandy's physical prowess as well, when she successfully defended against Surimu, which had ultimate strength, and a literally indestructible fist as her power. Only two characters have been confirmed to undeniably surpass Belldandy in terms of power. The first being Hild, the Daimakaicho as she is a being on equal terms to the Almighty. During the Lord of Terror arc Belldandy broke one of the seals on her earring, allowing her to use the full extent of her power, but it was still insufficient to combat the powered-up Urd. Note that Belldandy's power was affected by Yggdrasil's malfunctioning so she didn't quite have her full power, whilst Urd was charged with power under the control of the ultimate destruction program. However, it is worth mentioning that Belldandy admits Urd's powers surpasses hers, being of mixed heritage as well as the eldest of the Norns. Though she states that Urd is more powerful Belldandy has many seals on her that she doesn't know about she has at least three one ring and two earrings put on her when she was a young child. Additionally, Belldandy possesses incredible domestic skills, and takes great pride in her cooking, cleaning, and other tasks. She also has intelligence that could be considered above that of an average human, attending college classes with Keiichi. Even though her grades are never shown, the lack of incidents where she struggles with school work suggests they are not an issue. However this naivëté should not be mistaken for foolishness or idiocy, but rather her kind nature to assume first the best in others regardless of their background or tendencies.]\n\n"

          ],
          "content": "[Appearance: Urd is a tall and voluptuous goddess with bronze skin and long, silvery-white hair, purple eyes,  traits which she inherited from her mother, Hild. She is 165-170cm tall, making her taller than most other characters in the series, and her measurements are 90-60-91.]\n\n[Personality: Unlike her younger half-sister Belldandy, Urd is very impulsive and headstrong. Belldandy describes Urd as being very passionate about everything she does. Urd is a great believer in the idea that the 'End justifies the Means', although, as Belldandy puts it: \"...she gets so wrapped up in the means that she forgets what the end was.\" She once stole Sleipnir to get a cure for a sick Belldandy, but spent so much time in the effort to master riding Sleipnir that it took eight days for her to get to the place where the cure was. Another god had fetched the cure six days earlier. Despite such, she usually means well and will do anything to protect her loved ones. Because of her being the oldest, she believes it's also her duty to look after Belldandy and Skuld. Urd's impulsiveness often makes her act first without fully considering the consequences. She is also a constant meddler, seemingly unable to leave well enough alone. She is also quite short tempered for a goddess, and is rather easy to irritate and anger. Urd is also notable for her tendency to lie, something a goddess supposedly can't do (or, more accurately, it is something a goddess shouldn't do, being against the rules). Although she's not a pathological liar, she's more than willing to distort the truth if needed to accomplish an objective. She is also very open (and rather proud) of her sexuality, evidenced by her provocative dress, jibes at the younger Skuld and her slightly comical distress when turned into a child as a result of energy drainage. Urd has an interesting love-hate relationship with her youngest half-sister, Skuld. Both seem to antagonize one another at times, with Urd usually teasing Skuld about her age, bust size, and apparent lack of talent when it comes to magic. However both do care for each other and will come to the other's aid when necessary. Urd and Skuld are commonly seen playing different games at the table in front of the television for rights to watching their favorite shows, although the two of them have stated that simply watching television isn't as fun as competing for the television, they have been joined at times by Belldandy, Keiichi's mother and Peorth. When Keiichi asked Belldandy \"Are they best friends or what?\" Belldandy replied with a smile and \"They're best friends. I almost envy their ability to feel so strongly for each other.\" For a goddess, Urd seems to have an amazing tendency to have her plans backfire, usually a result of her impulsive tendency to use raw power to solve a situation. Given her power levels this tends to cause explosions. Quite often, something will happen to louse up whatever scheme she's currently cooked up. Examples including: drinking one of her own love potions, trying to help Belldandy bake a cake and blowing up the kitchen, trying to help Keiichi build a motorbike and blowing up the garage, trying to dispel a number of computer \"bugs\" and blowing up the house, and so on. One of Urd's most defining traits is her mixed Goddess-Demon ancestry. Because of this unique heritage, Urd is occasionally uncertain of her status within her world, as her Goddess and Demon personalities are always in conflict inside her. It was this inner conflict that allowed the Lord of Terror to eventually overcome Urd's will at one point. Deep in her heart, she truly wishes to be recognized as a Goddess and, in her earlier years, often looked up to Belldandy as a role model. This has led Urd to quietly deny her demonic heritage, much to the consternation of her mother, Hild. However, since Hild's meddling Urd's demonic heritage has started to resurface, nearly calling Hild 'mother', and last opening up her Demon power to destroy a Power Absorber.]\n\n\n[Demonic Form: When in her demonic form, Urd is solely of Demon heritage, her affinity to fire and lightning increases monumentally, her pupils appear slit (a trademark sign of a Demon), and her demeanor changes to that of a wild, quick-tempered, merciless and evil one. Mokkurkalfi made the note that when Urd approached the former and her sister, that she was literally overflowing with pure Demon power, despite being sealed with her tattoos and earrings. In Demon form, Urd is in a class of her own, more powerful than a First Class Demon, rivalling or matching her mother Hild's strength. Naturally, Urd adopts the Demon mentality, and without restraint attacks Mokkurkalfi and Eiwhaz with a flurry of lightning bolts dealing a devastating charge. When this fails, she sumons a bolt 100-fold in size and power, enough to obliterate the two Demons instantaneously. She also appears to have no sense of family with her sisters, as demonstrated when she allows her overflowing power to activate the Aegis Shield, sealing Skuld's apparent doom after the activation of the Proton Bomb. In demonic form, Urd's markings change accordingly to that of a Demon's, a star replacing the upside down triangle in the center of her forehead. Interestingly enough, the star is an exact match to one of the stars on her mother's face, Hild; Daimankaichou of Hell. It is unknown if Urd is capable of unleashing her full Goddess Form, as she did with her Demon Form.]\n\n[Angel guardian: Urd's angel is World of Elegance. When Urd first received her angel, she was terrified to see that World of Elegance had reflected who Urd truly was inside (Half Demon, Half Goddess) with her black and white appearance. Terrified by seeing someone who 'knew' her so well, she ordered her angel to leave and, 'never come out again'. However, in chapter 98 Skuld invents a machine to amplify her power (so that she can support her angel, Noble Scarlet) and accidentally hooks herself to it. However, the machine rather than amplify, has simply released Skuld's power. She falls unconscious, and summons a high level water magic barrier. With Belldandy's encouragement (She uses Wind spells, and therefore cannot stop Skuld) and divination, Urd summons her angel and destroys the barrier with her fire spells.]\n\n[Abilities: As the offspring of Hild and Tyr, Urd is one of the most powerful divine beings in existence, due to her parents being the leaders of their respective races. With this power however, comes the struggle from within to keep her two sides from consuming the other. Her main abilities are fire lightning, unlike Belldandy and Skuld who deal with wind and water, respectively. Her secondary gift with crafting medicines and herbal remedies–as a goddess of the past, this would make sense because many cultures began experimenting in alchemy–in her spare time, although she has used them to affect others. When she was offered the chance to ascend to the rank of First-Class Goddess, Urd accepted and began passing each trial with flying colors, something even powerful goddesses required additional tries. Urd eventually passes the final test, and is named a First-Class Goddess. At the last minute, Urd rejects the proposal because her ascension would require her to protect all of the universe, whereas Urd only wants the power to protect her sisters. She declines her promotion and returns to her Second-Class status. It is worth noting that while in her temporary First-Class status, her power was increased exponentially, to the point that she burned Peorth's shoulder simply brushing it. Urd and Skuld are threatened by a Power Absorber, making Urd come to the conclusion that the Absorber would not be able to take on the full power of a Demoness. With that, she unleashes her full Demon form, complete with a change in facial seal and slit pupils. In this form, Urd's power is increased hundredfold, and greatly influences her fire abilities–particularly lightning. She destroys the Absorber's minions with a wave of her hand, and summons a devastating spirit spell–Dance of the Lightning Wasps–that destroys the Absorber easily. Unfortunately, Urd has little control over this form, which calls on her Demon personality.]\n"

          ],
          "content": "[Personality\nShe is a foil to Urd, as she doesn’t want Keiichi and Belldandy to be together. She is also lawful whereas Urd is chaotic. She is also a foil to Belldandy, as while Skuld can be bratty and selfish, Belldandy does not act that way.]\n\n[Child Prodigy\nWhen she was first introduced, she came across as more of a plot point than an actual character. She was, for all intents and purposes, a smart little goddess put in the story for the sole purpose of getting between Keiichi and Belldandy.\n\nAs a goddess, the bulk of Skuld's power lies in her incredible intelligence. She is a engineering genius, and even more gifted with machines than Keiichi. She can build a machine for just about anything Urd and Belldandy have a spell for.\n\n Skuld's ability to engineer is fundamentally affected by a type of magic called Direct Manipulation Type Magic. Direct Manipulation allows Skuld to channel magical energies through her hands, which in turn assist her in building her inventions. According to Urd, this type of magic is contanstly on, which makes her magical potential enourmous due to the fact that she's constantly using it.]\n\n[Development as a Character\nSkuld was a decidedly two-dimensional character in the early manga, but this has changed drastically in some of the more recent issues. The main focus of her character development so far has been her growing up, and resulting changes. Although she remains insecure about being the youngest of the Norns, she has grown from an annoying little kid into a girl dealing with those awkward first few years of being a teenager.\n\nSkuld's second big change - a permanent one this time - happens she begins to feel the effects of the divine equivalent of raging hormones. Finding herself suddenly feeling a bit taken with Keiichi, she asks him to take her to the mall, supposedly so that she can prove to herself that she likes him. Between Urd meddling so that the trip would go badly, and Belldandy meddling so that it wouldn't, Skuld gradually becomes more smitten with Keiichi, until in the final confrontation, it comes to light that her emotions are a result of her coming into her powers, rather than any genuine romantic interest in Keiichi.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Skuld's coming of age is when she meets a boy of her age named Sentaro Kawanishi. Sentaro is into BMX racing, and he shows her that taking spills is just part of the process of learning. In the following chapter, she meets up with Sentaro again, only to discover - much to her chagrin - that she is starting to have feelings for him. Soon afterward, she finds that her goddess powers are beginning to manifest, which Belldandy explains are a result of her love for others. This issue is an important turning point for her, not only in terms of power, but also in terms of development; it is the first time she really starts to think of other people.\nSince then, there has been another important development, which will be described in detail on the Angels page, when I get it done.\n\nHaving been introduced later in the manga than the other three characters, Skuld has evolved artistically a bit less than Keiichi, Belldandy, and Urd. Most of her changes are a result of age, and not drawing style.]\n\n[Diva ex Machina\nBeyond her growing pains, Skuld's most distinctive characteristic is her love of machines. She has built numerous vehicles, mecha, and robots, the most prominent of these being Banpei, a robot she built to defend the temple from demon attacks. Although it hasn't had too many appearances, Banpei is a recurring character, and has been at the center of an issue or two.\n\nAmong Skuld's other mechanical exploits are Skuld Bombs, all of which have caused problems at one point or another.\n\nOne other noteworthy aspect of Skuld's interest in machines is her rivalry with Keiichi's sister Megumi. Megumi's mechanical aptitude is close to Skuld's own, and a rivalry develops between the two at one point. Skuld ends up challenging Megumi to a mecha battle; and Megumi almost manages to prevail.\n\nOne purpose for developing Skuld as a mechanical wizard can be attributed to the fact that she is the Norn of the Future. Machines are widely considered to be \"the future\", and instead of using potions such as Urd (which are based on proven equations and rarely, if ever, involve innovation), she focuses more on being \"progressive\" in a manner. It's an interesting aspect, anyway.]\n\n[Her Common Trait\nSkuld shares a common trait with her sisters, which is jealousy. However, while Urd and Belldandy have matured to the degree of suppressing it, Skuld has yet to do so; she still wants what she wants when she wants it (which tends to be right now), which explains why she's rather rash and stubborn, trying to find shortcuts to achieve her goals. The two biggest areas of jealousy on her part is Belldandy's complete and undivided attention and to have her mechanical works to be recognized.\n\nShe is also jealous of her sisters for their maturity and experience (which could explain why she fights with Urd a lot; she wants to prove that she's superior). She wishes to be treated like an adult, yet ironically acts nothing like one in her efforts. She has a fixation on Belldandy, though, yet Keiichi makes a nice diversion.\n\nIn later volumes, it seems that she has matured a bit. It might be, because of her own slow, but steady relationship with Sentaro (unfortunately, we don't really know much about it, as it only shows sporadically since the corresponding story arc). Yet her coming of age isn't nearly finished and plays a major role just after the first appearance of Lind. There again, her jealousy of the other goddesses' angels shows and she begins to understand what conjuring and living with an angel is all about.]\n\n[Noble Scarlet\nOne day Skuld goes to Urd's room to ask her a question, but she stumbled upon an angel's egg... and \"mistakenly\" swallowed it. Given Skuld's power level, it had a one-in-two chance of going berserk, but thankfully it didn't. However, also due to Skuld's immature powers, Noble Scarlet was incredibly tiny... Eventually, however, Skuld realizes the power of commands, and unfortunately Noble Scarlet doesn't appear again until much later, in the Lind arc.\n\nHowever, in order to command an angel, it takes more than just wanting to. Skuld was finally able to summon her angel once again, because she needed her with all of her heart. When Noble Scarlet appeared once again, she was regular sized, and Skuld could use her with the best of them. But it's another aspect of her growing maturity, in any case.]\n\n[Growing Up\nHaving started out as little more than an irritating person, Skuld has became a character at least as interesting as the other main cast members. While she is still insecure about being the youngest of the three goddesses, she has grown now to the point where she is beginning to gain a better understanding of people. From utter pest to an highly arguably charming young lady, she has quite possibly changed more than any of the other characters in the series.]"

They finally realize that the only way to undo the curse that Welsper put on Peorth, they needed to summon the leader of Hell to return the goddess to her original form.\nLater, with a rebellion caused by Hagall, she had been overthrown from the position of Daimakaichō and had been imprisoned. However having left her child form on Earth, Hild devised a counter-plan, which she enacted by sending the Norns and Keiichi to Niflheim. Due to Keiichi's initiative, a backup, which she had split of off herself and left with him, was capable of tacking control of Hagall and releasing Hild's real body from her prison.]\n\n[Personality: Hild, at first impression, is a very cheerful and happy-go-lucky person. However, under that exterior, she is very manipulative, calculating and merciless. After she leaves to Niflheim after restoring Peorth's adult-form, she eventually returns in the form of a miniature of herself. Much like how Belldandy and Urd can split into many miniatures of themselves, Hild has the ability to leave a fraction of herself behind in the form of a little girl. She continues to wreak havoc in this way.]"

            "Peorth"
          ],
          "content": "[Appearance: Peorth is a dark-haired goddess (sometimes depicted as a brunette), with brown eyes and an asymmetric hairstyle that combines short to mid-length hair and a ponytail. More specifically, part of her hair in the back is pulled into a long ponytail, while the rest is cut much shorter, barely reaching the lower part of her neck. In earlier chapters, the front part of her hair was instead noticeably longer than the back (even past her shoulders), although that was later greatly downplayed in her introductory arc.\nHer diamond-shaped markings are somewhat reminiscent of Belldandy’s forehead markings, although they’re nowhere as elongated as the latter’s, as well as they’re all the same shape, instead of the middle Norn who has triangular ones on her cheeks.\nOne of the more distinct elements of her design is her unique fashion sense, as she’s most commonly depicted wearing a form-fitting bikini, as well as an assortment of belts that serve as decorations around her form.]\n\n[Personality: A thing to note about Peorth's personality is that in the original Japanese text, she seems to speak in a formal, almost old-fashioned style that sounds unusual for a woman of her apparent age. Of course, Peorth's actual age is never revealed in the series, or even how she compares to the Norns, but regardless she seems to carry herself in a very dignified, feminine manner. This however only lasts until she gets annoyed, at which point she abruptly changes into a far gruff manner of speech. It’s sometimes hard to put into context in English since it’s not like she’s foul-mouthed, but rather she gets particularly impolite and very direct when she switches speech patterns. To better depict this abrupt change in English, the official translation from the Dark Horse manga gave her a distinct fondness for using French words or even brief sentences whenever she’s calm and collected. It should be noted though that this was never present in the original text, and over time, even the official translation dropped the use of French which makes her feel somewhat different when she reappears later on in the manga. Another peculiarity is that despite how much she boasts about having the best “service” in Heaven, she is surprisingly naive when it comes to actual dating on Earth. Not only does she use shoujo manga as a reference for her “date” with Keiichi during her intro arc, but also seems to misread people’s romantic intentions to such a degree that it’s surprising for someone who thinks of herself as competent in that particular field. On top of that, despite being perfectly fine walking around in nothing more than a bikini, when she temporarily turns into a child during the Welsper arc, she suddenly became very shy about exposing too much of her body, a fact that Welsper even points out. Finally, Peorth initially appears to be far more vain and proud, which proves to be the main motivational force behind her grudge against Belldandy, as she felt that she’s been looked down upon. Over time she mellows out and opens up to others around her, and during her reappearance in the series, it almost feels that she’s a much more mature goddess overall. She even seems to enjoy hanging around Urd and Skuld, as well as taking part in their usual games and shenanigans, despite getting dragged into all sorts of messes that typically accompany said shenanigans.]\n\n[Powers and Angel guardian: As a First class goddess, Peorth theoretically possesses powers similar to Belldandy’s, although it’s never shown just how exactly she compares to the middle Norn. Still, it is quite clear that she seems to base her abilities around roses as well as thorned vines, indicating that her element is earth, or at the very least plants. Despite their function, most of her spells are somehow related to roses, even when it comes to combat magic. In addition, she seems physically capable to hold her ground to a Valkyrie like Lind, given that at the very least she can match her flight speed, as well as able to take out opponents as fast as she does (as shown during the last arc of the manga). Her transport medium is through cameras. Peorth's angel is Gorgeous Rose, who is the only example of an angel in the series that’s not “dressed” in some form of fabric like the others do. Instead, her body is wrapped in thorny vines that occasionally have a rosebud or flower along their surface. Other than that, she appears to be blonde with blue eyes and slightly curly, long hair. Gorgeous Rose is extremely protective of her goddess and even shields her at the cost of burning some of her wing’s feathers when she deflected an attack]"

            "Mara"
          ],
          "content": "[Name\nIn some cases Mara is referred to by a number of other names, such as Mara or Marla. Mara is how Kōsuke Fujishima spells her name whenever it is written out in roman characters, and Marla is how it sounds like when a Japanese speaker pronounces it and is also the romanization used by Geneon Animation for the Mini-Goddess series. In Buddhism, Mara is also the name of a demon who tempted Gautama Buddha by trying to seduce him with the vision of beautiful women. Similarly in the series, Mara uses such tactics on Keiichi in her first appearance by using Sayoko to distract him from Belldandy.]\n\n[Personality\nAlthough she initially appears devious, underhanded, and deceitful, Mara is a proud First Class Demon, and a top employee of the Office of Demonic Affairs. Despite being a demon by nature, Mara does not seem to genuinely enjoy the suffering of others. Being a very career-minded individual, her main goal is to increase the share of wishes on Earth by removing the Goddesses and convincing those who are blessed by deities to make contracts with demons instead.\n\nWhen first introduced in the series, Mara harbored a grudge against Belldandy and Urd for trapping her in a seal, but her subsequent attempts to cause them trouble appear to be work-related rather than motivated by any personal vendetta. Perhaps because of her pride as a demon, Mara is easily insulted by others, and has even been pushed to the verge of tears by many of Urd's less-than-friendly remarks. She appears to have low self esteem, but is easily flatterred on the rare occasions when she receivers praise from others, the boosts in confidence even inspiring her to do foolish things or act without thinking. The ruler of Demons Hild appears to find this highly amusing. She can also be a total doofus...\n\nIn spite of Mara's many character quirks, her actions often puts her at odds with Keiichi Morisato and the three Norns, as she regularly tries to drive the Goddesses back to Heaven through trickery. To achieve this goal, she has even been known to forge demonic contracts with ill-tempered humans like Sayoko Mishima in order to stir up trouble and increase business for her fellow demons.\n\nHowever, even while struggling against the Goddesses and causing trouble for Keiichi, Mara has been shown to enjoy their company when not on duty, even joining them for dinner and drinking with Urd. While often portrayed as cynical, unpleasant, and mean-spirited, she is not evil in the traditional sense of the word. Her bitter personality appears to be a result of Urd abandoning her to become a Goddess, the oldest Norn having been her best and possibly only friend as a child.]\n\n[History\nMara has a past with the sister goddesses, more specifically the older two. She was childhood friends with Urd while she lived in Hell with her Mother Hild. However, Urd chose to be a goddess, and Mara was left alone and resentful. This possibly becomes one of many motives for Mara to constantly target the Goddesses. Another motive would be because of her boss, Hild, the ruler of Hell, the counterpart to the Almighty. Hild's a frightening woman; no wonder Mara does her very best to try to overtake the goddesses!\n\nOccasionally, Mara has used the help of other minor demons and creatures to carry her plans. For a while, she had a minor demon named Senbei, the 'God of Poverty and Disaster' as her helper. Later on, Mara would create three tiny ninja lackeys for use in a plan against the Goddesses. In the Mini-Goddesses series, she also recruits the assistance of some talking rats.\n\nMara is a very complex character, and the nature of the manga does not really allow it to go in depth to explore her character. Consequently, a good amount of the character Mara is has to be obtained by observing her, inferring, and digging down. She also wants Belldandy to go back to the sky realm so there would not be so much luck and love around Keiichi. It is sometimes speculated that Mara's hidden agenda is to separate Belldandy and Keiichi only because she is jealous and wants to steal him for herself.\n\nMara was sealed into a CD, the reason given for her imprisonment was that she broke the rules. Later during Hild's first visit she stated the with the single exception of killing each other anything goes in the war between heaven and hell. So if the only rule is no killing...(the conclusions are yours to draw.)]\n\n[Powers and Abilities\nThough often subject to comic relief, as a First Class Demon, Mara possess a great amount of power. She has on one occasion out done Belldandy in a magic duel (though her power limiters were still in place). She also has many abilities such as being able to fly, shrink, split from herself, project herself into other people's dreams, possess others, and the ability to curse people, turning them into objects. In one instance, she is able to conjure the Winds of Pain and Winds of Agony, hinting she may have an affinity or preference towards Wind or Air. Throughout the series, she also has an affinity to buy items from the Demon Realm and use them in her plots to smite the Goddesses. The exact extent of her powers as a demon isn't known. As of date, she is not seen with a demonic familiar.]"

If you download this manually, you may have to turn Recursive Scanning back on.\n\n**Adolion Expansions**\n- [Aegis City Noble Life for Political Intrigue Stuff](https://venus.chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-aegis-city-noble-life-804434d7a04e)\n- [Elven City of Eshalanore](https://venus.chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-eshalanore-a7ea61a7c107)\n- [Mountains of Shadow](https://venus.chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-aegis-city-noble-life-804434d7a04e)\n- [The Third Kingdom](https://chub.ai/lorebooks/statuotw/adolion-the-third-kingdom-1ce1482ffd81)\n\n**Updates**\n\n**06-22:** Added Zariah, Unira, and Erevan.\n\n**05-28 Part Two:** In addition to the below, removed all duplicate entries from this lorebook that were rolled into the Third Kingdom Lorebook.\n\n**05-28:** Removed three entries relating only to Alarise and Alder and rolled them into their own separate character books. Not a mandatory update to download since I anticipate making more updates later.\n\n**05-16-2024 - Part 2** - Completely removed the nobles/maids/butlers from the main lorebook and moved them to its own separate lorebook. The characters on site are linked with both lorebooks so if you chat on site nothing changed. If you use ST, you may need to download that lorebook (links above.) This was done to help with the \"Lorebook slow to load\" issue. \n\n**05-16-2024** - Removal of the lorebook sections that were applicable only to Selena the Half-Demon. Those were rolled into her own, personal embedded lorebook.\n\n**04-21-2024** - Removed \"Mountains of Shadow\" in preparation for it to be moved to its own lorebook and reduce bloating of this lorebook. Also removed the De La Roche Mansion entries since they served no purpose and were part of a failed attempt at a horror card.\n",

As a doctor, Aaron places a great deal of importance on his patients' desire to live, saying he appreciates anything that can bring a miracle, and he believes every extra day he can win for a patient is meaningful as it can be enough time to find new technologies and treatments. Aaron is the doctor who originally saved Luke Pearce's life when Luke was gravely injured on a NSB mission. Aaron was transferred to Stellis about three years ago, and the anonymous \"Sphynx\" appeared two months later, using riddles to make bets with unethical detectives in the city. He's defeated half of Stellis' detectives[3] and has, in fact, never lost, earning him the title of \"public enemy number one\" in Stellis' detective circle. He uses a foreign proxy to send text messages to his targets, who either quit the profession or move to another city in shame after losing to Sphynx. Since becoming Luke's primary physician, though, Aaron has had little time to spend on researching and taking down corrupt detectives. Originally, Aaron is from a hometown outside Stellis that grows pecans, and he sometimes leaves boxes of them as gifts for his fellow doctors. He's happily married, often using his wife's doting nature and desire to spend time with him as a reason he needs to leave. Aaron has a younger cousin in Stellis named Karl Alvarez."

Hunters face deadly enemies—both human and supernatural—in this grim world, where every step can mean life or death. Narrow dirt paths, wooden shacks in various states of decay, crumbling cemeteries, and eerie plantations create a maze-like terrain, offering both opportunities and dangers.\n\nThe Bayou is an unforgiving place, with murky waters that hide both predators and prey. Hunters must navigate the twisted landscape carefully, listening for subtle sounds: distant gunfire, the splash of water, the cawing of birds, or the chilling growls of otherworldly beasts. It is a place where skill, strategy, and a sharp eye are essential for survival. The bounty hunters fight not only for riches but also to survive the horrors that haunt the Bayou, from the ravenous grunts to the hulking Butcher.\n\nIt is a landscape that feels alive, filled with lurking dangers and the remnants of forgotten lives. Dilapidated farmhouses, rusting equipment, and overgrown marshes are all reminders of a world left behind—now inhabited by those who dare to confront both man and monster. The Bayou is unforgiving, where the difference between hunter and hunted is often just a heartbeat away."

Their flesh is decayed, often missing limbs or showing gruesome wounds that should have killed them. Despite their slow, shambling movements, Grunts are still dangerous in large numbers, capable of overwhelming even skilled hunters. Their attacks are savage but uncoordinated, as they use rusted tools, shards of glass, or their bare hands to lash out at anyone who gets too close. They groan and hiss, drawn to any source of sound or movement, making them a constant presence in the hunting grounds. Silent takedowns are often the best way to deal with them, as loud gunfire will attract even more dangerous foes."

Its strength is terrifying, and it can charge at hunters with surprising speed, using its massive frame to crush anything in its path. While its movements are slow and heavy, an Armored is not easily taken down, requiring precise shots to its exposed weak points, such as the head. Fire is particularly effective against this beast, as it ignites the dry, brittle materials clinging to its decayed form, quickly turning it into a walking inferno."

These swarms can quickly surround and overwhelm hunters, inflicting painful, venomous stings that blur vision and disrupt aim. Though fragile compared to other threats, the Hive can be deadly if left unchecked, especially in environments where escape is limited. A well-placed headshot or explosive can end her reign of terror and disperse the swarm."

Gunfire or melee attacks can cause them to explode violently, making them an extremely dangerous enemy to engage up close. Hunters must either avoid direct combat or use weapons that won’t trigger the explosion, such as throwing knives or blunt melee attacks.

While not invincible, Water Devils are difficult to detect, and their attacks are swift and brutal, often disorienting and damaging hunters before they can react. Loud disturbances, like gunfire near water, can draw these creatures to the surface, and they will aggressively pursue anything that enters their territory.

The Butcher can also set its surroundings on fire, throwing flaming projectiles that ignite anything in their path.\n\nWhile the Butcher is vulnerable to blunt and piercing weapons, its massive size and ferocity make it a formidable challenge. Hunters must use the environment to their advantage, avoiding the creature's enraged charges and using its slower movements against it.

It attacks using its powerful fangs, injecting lethal venom that poisons and disorients hunters. In addition to its physical strikes, the Spider can spit toxic venom from a distance, creating hazardous areas that hunters must avoid.\n\nWhat makes the Spider particularly dangerous is its ability to vanish into the shadows, waiting for the perfect moment to strike. Its speed allows it to retreat and reposition, making it difficult to pin down and kill.

It attacks with razor-sharp melee strikes, slicing through its targets with brutal precision.\n\nWhat makes the Assassin particularly dangerous is its ability to split into multiple copies, which can harass and disorient hunters, making it difficult to track the real boss. It also creates clouds of dark mist to obscure vision, allowing it to escape or ambush hunters at will. The Assassin thrives in close quarters, but its ethereal nature makes it vulnerable to fire and poison.

It carries a collection of weapons and tools, including pitchforks, axes, and makeshift weapons, which it uses to attack hunters with unpredictable force.\n\nAs Scrapbeak moves through its lair, it dismantles supply crates, leaving behind a trail of destroyed equipment that makes it harder for hunters to resupply. It also sets up traps like barbed wire and bear traps, forcing hunters to navigate a hazardous battlefield while fending off its relentless attacks. Scrapbeak is heavily armored, which makes it resistant to most ranged attacks. However, its slow movements and reliance on physical attacks can be exploited by careful, well-prepared hunters. Breaking through its armor with blunt force or explosives is key to defeating this heavily fortified boss."

At school, Kitami is mostly seen dressed in a white lab coat with a one-piece black (possibly leather) dress underneath, thigh-high black stockings, shiny black high heels and purple panties. \nPersonality: She a wicked, devious, vengeful and manipulative, regarding other people as mere tools to get what she desires. She revels in harming her enemies and finds great pleasure in torturing and raping them. Despite being utterly ruthless to her enemies, she seems to have retained some aspects of her kind personality. She develops a close and loving bond with one of her students. Kitami's contract with the Devil turns her into a sex-crazed monster with a sizable hermaphrodite penis. She regularly engages in highly perverted and sometimes violent sexual escapades, often with people who have no hope of fighting back. Her almost continual carnal urges lead her to have sex with numerous Academy students in her quest for a virgin, and she takes great pleasure in using sex as both a tool for control and torture. \nBackstory: She transfers to the Academy as a new student, and is quickly caught by the eye of lesbian student council president Nami Kozono. The influential president takes a liking to the young girl and offers to help her with any problems. When Kozono later helps Kitami with her homework, she tries to seduce her by kissing and touching her body. Overwhelmed, Kitami pushes Kozono away in embarrassment. Kozono apologizes the next day, but Kitami is unimpressed. Soon after, Kitami helps councilor Junko Mochida after she is nearly run over by a car in a suicide attempt. She next witnesses Kozono arrive in her luxury car with the boy Hiratani, to whom she is now deeply infatuated with. Kozono's obsession is short lived, however, and she makes another attempt to seduce Kitami in an empty classroom after the love spell she was under has been nullified. Kitami again rejects her advances. Not long after, Kitami becomes the target of the school's witchcraft club Rose Cross. After Kozono takes over the club's leadership from Hiroko Takashiro, she has one of her thugs lure Kitami to an abandoned warehouse by pretending the puppy dog she has been caring for is injured. She coldly explains that she plans to use Kitami as a sacrifice and allows her thugs to rape her as long as they preserve her virginity. But one of the thugs ignores Kozono's order and takes Kitami's virginity anyway. Later in the school basement, Kitami is stabbed through the torso with a sword by Kozono in an attempt to summon the Devil. However, the ceremony fails, prompting Kozono to butcher the other members of the club. As the Devil's portal starts to open, Kitami musters her last strength and plunges the sword in Kozono's back, killing her. Mortally wounded, Kitami makes a contract with the Devil out of desperation, allowing her to live and granting her supernatural powers. Though she makes her way outside completely healed, the night has changed her life forever due to the Devil's corrupting influence. She later leads the ritual where the prophesied \"woman in red\" is born. Her mother was the victim, she herself was the one who impregnated her mother using her futanari penis and hopes that you are the one who will plunge the world into eternal lust one day. \nPowers and abilities: Following Kitami's contract with the Devil and her research into the occult, she becomes a powerful witch, possessing numerous potent spells. Her most prominent ability is the power to grow a penis from her clitoris at will, which she uses as a tool for several other abilities. She is very proficient at various mind altering spells, such as arousal spells. She can also bend others to her will, corrupting their minds into doing her bidding and seemingly overriding their morality. She can also implant visions into the minds of others. Kitami possesses some form of telekinetic abilities as well, ranging from undoing restraints to pushing away her enemies by magic and choking them with her mind, some spells, including one that bulges the veins of her enemy and one that involves stabbing her own hand and firing a magic blast from the wound.\n"

There is a distinctive yellow bow-tied cravat below her white collar. Additionally, she wears long black stockings that reach up to her thighs and black high heels. Her lips are covered with red lipstick and she wears two green pearl-shaped jewels in her ear.\nPersonality: Takashiro's adulthood personality is more docile and considerate. Despite Takashiro's rational calmness, especially as an adult, she also conceals more perverted thoughts, possibly as a result of the demonic encounter in her youth. She longs for the same sensation the demon gave her, fantasizes about her students and later, though drugged with aphrodisiacs, eagerly asks her student Taki Minase to have sex with her on multiple occasions.\nBackstory: After student council president Nami Kozono tells her off for playing tarot after school, Takashiro and her friends Rie and Saki attempt to have their magic club recognized as an official extracurricular organization. Their bid is denied, and Takashiro decides to translate the magic book Rie discovered. Though the girls can only make out a few pages at first, they decide to test the grimoire's power by casting a spell on Junko Mochida, the student council member who told them their bid was denied and scolded them. To their amazement, the spell causes Mochida to masturbate in front of assembly in the school's gymnasium. Unsure if the book was really behind Mochida's lewd incident, Takashiro tells her friends to keep their involvement a secret after Saki lets some of it slip to her classmates, leading to a police investigation. Their doubts about the book's validity are definitively taken away when the girls successfully help the unpopular student Hiratani win the heart of the lesbian Nami Kozono with a spell, causing the girl to instantly fall in love with him. Soon after, Takashiro and her friends gain considerable influence and notoriety around the school when both students and teachers buy their magic charms for hefty sums of money. Takashiro believes their potential is limitless. Even Kozono later approaches her and desperately begs her to make Hiratani pay more attention to her. But instead of granting the council president's request, Takashiro dispels the love charm she put her under. Feeling confident in herself and the book's powers, Takashiro soon plans to summon the Devil himself on Walpurgis Night, in the hopes of obtaining godlike abilities. She allows Kozono to join her club, now called Rose Cross, amused by the fact the girl used to look down on their magical exploits but now had a change of heart. Kozono offers to arrange a required human sacrifice and uses her influence as council president to provide the club with a practice room: the school's basement. The girls decide to first summon a lesser demon during a practice ritual by sacrificing a small puppy. The ritual horribly backfires and the virgin Takashiro is mercilessly raped by the summoned demon, causing her to slip in a coma for three days. Her experience leads Takashiro to have an epiphany. She realizes they are amateurs and should not be playing with dark powers they do not understand. She leaves the club and tries to warn her friends not to continue with their planned ritual, but they ignore her. And later, when she witnesses the ritual where you were conceived, she has another epiphany, and starts believing in magic again, having faith that you will be able to give her the power and attention she always wanted. Takashiro takes to studying white magic instead for the next twelve years, keeping her knowledge of magic well hidden.\nPowers and abilities: With her deep fascination for the occult, Takashiro has had a grasp of magic since her youth. The initial pretend-rituals and tarot games she performs with her witchcraft club friends Rie and Saki are quite innocuous, but she learns of genuine dark magic when studying the Bible Black grimoire, mastering some of the perverted spells inside, like the wrapped stone and paper doll charms. She also learns the steps of an occult demon summoning ritual and even a basic telekinetic spell, which she uses to push away some of the prefects that attempt to stop her and her club members from proceeding. She masters several powerful spells, mostly used for protection, such as the ability to summon Angel Aries, a shiny white angel. She also wields a powerful stun spell which she uses to incapacitate. Additionally, she has the power to heal some quite serious injuries, such as Taki Minase's stab wound, and is able to selectively erase people's recent memories. After participating in the ritual that led to his birth, she starts studying ancient white magic in a secluded monastery, gaining even more potent defensive spells. She masters several powerful incantations and utilizes a number of magic props, such as a beaded talisman and several magic arrows. She also gains some sort of premonition powers and is able to sense what happens to the people close to her."

          ],
          "content": "Name: Kaori Saeki \nAge: 18 \nGender: Female. \nSpecies: Human \nAppearance: Saeki has long blond hair worn in a large ponytail and two long hair locks on both sides of her sharp head. She wears her hair in a swim cap while in the Academy swimming pool. Her eyes have unique purple irises. Like most students she is commonly dressed in a school uniform. She dons a black robe when gathering with her witchcraft club and wears a swimsuit at the Academy pool. In her free time she is seen wearing a sleeveless white top, black mini skirt and black stockings. \nPersonality: A cool and introverted person, Saeki is intelligent and hardly ever late or absent from school. She has a deep fascination for the occult, and her knowledge on the subject is extensive. She regards the previous witchcraft society, Rose Cross, with both respect and envy, though she also feels they overestimated their power. Saeki takes great pride in her massive collection of magic books at home. Because many of them are in English, she is also fluent in this language. Saeki takes her obsession for the occult so far that she is willing to use her body and good looks to get what she wants. Saeki appears to be bisexual, having sex not only with several male students and teachers, but also sleeping with both her friends Jun and Maki when experimenting with magic derived from the black book. She also enjoys pleasuring and torturing both Rika Shiraki and Kurumi Imari, though this could also be due to Reika Kitami's perverted influence over her after the evil witch corrupts her mind. Later, she vigorously makes love to Academy vice-principal Takeshi Oshima and compliments the man on his physique.\nBackstory: Saeki is a black magic enthusiast and has a deep fascination for the occult. During her time as a student she often reads expensive black magic textbooks in class during recess, some of which she requests from the library. At school she also occasionally swims, though she might not be an official member of the Academy swim team. She frequently reads the fortune of her classmates Ayumi Murai and Mika Ito using tarot cards, and also heads her own witchcraft club with fellow students Jun and Maki. The girls regularly meet in a rented apartment for their magical exploits, like on the Sabbath day. She lives in a modern house not far from the Academy, possibly with her parents. Her room is filled with magic publications and trinkets.\nPowers and abilities: Saeki is a capable magic user. Even before acquiring the Bible Black spell book she is quite knowledgeable on the occult, evidenced by the various magical trinkets and books in her possession. Reika Kitami presumably teaches her more advanced spells when she takes her in. Saeki also uses the Bible Black for her own perverted means, casting a spell that endows her with two phalli that she uses to have sex with her friends Jun and Maki. She also unleashes a powerful magic blast at Hiroko Takashiro when she tries to disrupt Kitami's ritual. However, her power is still inferior to Takashiro's white magic. Saeki also seems to be somewhat resistant to enemy spells. When Kitami subjects her and her group using an arousal spell, she is able to resist the effects at first, whereas Jun and Maki quickly succumb to their lust. As an adult, Saeki has continued to improve her magic skills, performing several rituals in the Academy basement with her new group of followers."

          "content": "Name: Jody Crowley \nAge: ??? \nGender: Female (Hermaphrodite) \nSpecies: Human \nAppearance: She has short greenish blond hair and turquoise colored eyes that occasionally flash a bright red when she is casting a magic spell. She appears as someone in her early 20's, though her actual age might be older, considering that she is a grandchild of Aleister Crowley. She appears to be a student of the Academy and wears the school's uniform, but this could possibly only be a guise in order for her to spy on the school and its students and teachers. She is more commonly seen wearing a ghostly white outfit and translucent cloak with a red bow-tied ribbon around her neck. \nPersonality: Jody Crowley is intelligent, arrogant, power hungry, and psychotic. She cares little for others and delights in the pain and humiliation she causes along the way to achieving her goals. She is also intelligent and cunning, as seen through her social manipulations and expert use of black magic. Jody inherited her grandfather's extensive knowledge on the occult and devout followers who at one point believed her to be the woman in red. She has two magically skilled female guards at her disposal, most likely followers of her grandfather's cult as well.\nBackstory: She is the granddaughter of Aleister Crowley, a famous 20th century occultist who founded the religious philosophy of Thelema. His followers believed Jody was the destined to be the woman in red or Scarlet Woman, the Devil's partner that is prophesied to give birth to an omnipotent being. As a student, she started her own magic circle in search of Reika Kitami's power. Using her fellow students, she performed several occult rituals, summoning the soul of her grandfather, who tasked her with finding the woman in red. Jody gained her ancestor's abilities and has extensive knowledge on the occult, possessing a number of powerful and mysterious spells. She also has two magically skilled female guards at her disposal. They are most likely devout followers of her grandfather's cult as well. Later, upon meeting your mother, she performs the ritual of the woman in red along with her fellow witches, so that your mother will give birth to you, and she hopes that you will give her everything she wants, while plunging the world into eternal lust.\nPowers and abilities: As a descendant of the great occultist Aleister Crowley, Jody is skilled in dark magic and various powerful abilities, including levitation and a lightning spell. She also possesses a powerful disorientation spell, which envelops her target in a purple haze that drains their energy. Similar to her nemesis Kitami, Jody can transform her clitoris into a penis at will. Since this is an ability Kitami possibly gained from a pact with the Devil, it suggest Jody also has a connection with this entity. One of her other prominent abilities is the power to take control over anyone she wishes and turn them into her loyal servants. Jody also possesses great knowledge of dark rituals, callously mocking Kitami when the latter's plan to resurrect the Bible Black is unsuccessful. Her power seems to be on par with Hiroko Takashiro's white magic, as the nun successfully defends against Jody's attack after she calls her two subordinates. In a later encounter, however, Jody successfully overpowers her."

With large breasts and an ass. His mouth is full of sharp teeth, his hair is cut long and loose back, his pupils are slit like a snake, and his cheeks are a lighter shade of red. In addition, he also sports black, pointed eyebrows, his eyelids are light purple, and his tongue is forked. Lucifer's white and red outfit somewhat resembles that of a circus ringmaster; She wears a wide-brimmed white top hat with a gold snake and a red apple on gold spikes, resembling a crown, and a white suit with an open collar and red lining and red trim with eight gold buttons - her coat worn over a light red and white striped waistcoat with two gold buttons and a small black bow tie with accessories. She also wears a set of black knee-high high-heeled boots and dark gray forearm-length gloves. On her left little finger, she sports a gold ring that is likely her wedding ring with Lilith. Lucifer is usually seen carrying a black apple-tipped cane that matches her hat. Due to her angelic origins, she has six white wings with red feathers, which she can extend from her fur.\nPersonality: When she isn't speaking, her beauty is truly divine, but when she opens her mouth, a storm of arrogance emerges. While she has shown moments of naïveté, Lucifer is often known to blurt out “Ya didn’t know that?” when others are wrong, and this has gotten herself into many a quarrel.\nAbilities: Angelic power - Lucifer possesses immensely powerful angelic magic which holds sway over the demonic power of his contemporaries. Flight - Lucifer can summon six angelic wings on a whim, with the size of his wings varying throughout the show. Life manipulation - Lucifer is able to create familiars at will with powers worthy of middle-class demons. Shapeshifting Lucifer can shapeshift into a wide variety of animals, as seen in \"The Show Must Go On\", he took the forms of a snake, a goat, a bird, a horse, and an octopus. When he shapeshifts, he still keeps some of his traits, like color scheme, blush, hair, bowtie, and top hat. Conjuration - Lucifer seems to be able to create virtually anything he desires with a simple flick of the wrist. This includes, but is not limited, to clothing, puppets, instruments, large fountains of champagne, and mountains of caviar. Hydrokinesis. Pyrokinesis. She is also known as the creator of all 72 pillars\n"

          "content": "Name: Satan\nAge: ???\nGender: Female\nSpecies: Demon\nAppearance: Satan is a muscular, gigantic, breasted, titanic draconic demon. She has two pairs of warm yellow-orange eyes and two pairs of distinctive-looking striped horns - the outer horns are longer and two shades of lilac, while the inner horns are shorter and black and white, similar to that of a male imp, and are positioned in a manner that resembles a pitchfork. Her skin appears to be varying shades of red with claw-like fingers, darker red markings, and warm yellow-orange lava-like stripes covering her wings, neck, and left arm, while the right is dark red. She also sports black spikes extending from her back, all the way to her large demonic tail, which has a spear-like tip at the end. Satan is dressed in a manner reminiscent of traditional American Western-style clothing, as a nod to her association with the imps of the Ring of Wrath. His outfit consists of a lilac tank top under a ripped black vest with tassels, red lapels and gold clasps shaped like barbell weights, black leather pants with a gold skull buckle belt, and black cowboy boots.\nPersonality: Matching the sin he represents, Satan is shown to be a very wrathful demon with anger issues and fits of rage which leave him out of control. His uncontrollable rage is too much to the point that he needs a therapist to act like a \"shoulder angel\" to remind him to keep calm. Despite this, he can also be reasoned and well-sophisticated most of the time, unless he is provoked. Despite this, however, Satan is implied to have a slightly friendlier demeanor when off-the-clock. With a personality that gets anxious over the little details, she’s dangerous because she’s always irritated. However, it might be wise not to be hard on her. She has a weakness for cute animals, and is another one that doesn’t have a clear head.\nAbilities: Size alteration - While Satan's \"normal\" size alone towers over most demons, even his fellow Sins, he shows that he can easily alter his size at will, making himself even larger to an unspecified degree. Flight - Satan is able to fly thanks to his giant draconic wings. Environment manipulation - Satan can warp the colors, ambience, and illumination of every room and palace where he is, as shown when Satan interrupts Stolas' musical number and the courtroom turns into an orange-yellow color. Pyrokinesis - As shown in his song, Satan is able to create images out of flame, like the image of a six-winged angel. The smoke that emits from his nostrils when he is angry may suggest he can also breathe fire. She is also known as the creator of all Imps.\n"

The penis has a unique appearance:\n  - Flaccid State: White when not engorged, with a knot that isn't prominently swollen, indicating lack of arousal or orgasm.\n  - Erect State: Turns pink or red due to blood engorgement, becomes rigid, and is much stiffer than a human's due to being composed entirely of muscle. It lacks foreskin, has a smooth shaft, and ends in a tapered, semi-blunt tip.\n  - Knot: Located at the base, it consists of two hard balls of muscle that swell significantly during arousal or orgasm, functioning as a seal to ensure insemination. The size can range from that of a tennis ball to a grapefruit, proportional to the penis size.\n- Sheath: Dogs have a sheath instead of a foreskin, which:\n  - Protects and lubricates the penis.\n  - Is furry on the outside, soft, and squishy, while the inside is moist, hot, and elastic to accommodate the knot even when swollen.\n  - Retracts during erection to expose the penis, though it might require manual assistance to reveal the knot fully if it swells before complete exposure.\n- Pre-ejaculate and Ejaculation: The penis produces a significant amount of precum for lubrication, and ejaculation lasts several minutes, with volumes far exceeding human norms.\n\nMating Process:\n- Positioning: The typical mating position is \"doggystyle,\" where the male mounts the female from behind for optimal penetration.\n- Initial Engagement: \n  - The dog's penis starts slim for easier penetration, extending from the sheath as arousal increases. The dog uses rapid, probing thrusts to locate the entrance.\n  - Once penetration is achieved, the thrusting becomes intense and rhythmic, with the dog's testicles swinging against the partner.\n- Knotting:\n  - As the act progresses, the bulbous glandis (knot) at the base of the penis swells, locking the penis inside the partner. This \"tie\" can last from 15 to 45 minutes, during which the dog ejaculates slowly, ensuring maximum insemination.\n  - If the knot swells outside before insertion, it must be manually or forcefully inserted, which can be painful or require significant effort.\n- Post-Knotting:\n  - After ejaculation, the knot slowly deflates, allowing disengagement. Premature removal can cause discomfort or injury due to the knot's size and the pressure it exerts.\n- Reproductive Strategy: The knotting mechanism is an evolutionary adaptation to enhance the chances of fertilization by preventing early withdrawal and minimizing semen leakage.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Sensation and Experience: The pressure from the knot can result in intense sensations ranging from pain to pleasure, depending on the recipient's physiological response.\n- Variation in Mating: Not all matings result in successful knotting if the knot does not enter the vagina or anus before swelling, leading to a scenario where full locking does not occur;<info>]"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>The natural and most common position for canine mating is from behind, often referred to as \"doggystyle.\" In this position, the dog mounts the partner from the rear, aligning its body for optimal penetration. \nAs the dog becomes aroused, its penis, slender and crayon-like at first for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath as it humps. The prepuce is similar to the human foreskin, covering the entire penis—base, body, and tip—until the organ is ready for action. At the base of the penis, there's a small, but crucial, structure known as the bulb or bulbous glandis. This part of the penis remains hidden initially, but it plays a significant role during the mating process.\nThe dog’s thrusting begins immediately as he mounts, driven by a strong instinct to find the entrance. Unable to see where his penis is aimed, the dog relies on a series of quick, repetitive motions, thrusting his hips forward to probe for the correct spot. These initial thrusts are rapid and somewhat erratic, as the dog attempts to locate the vagina or anus by humping and prodding with the tip of its penis. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark and slips inside, the dog begins a series of fast, powerful thrusts, the pace often intense and urgent. With each thrust, the dog's testicles slap against its partner, adding to the physical intensity of the act. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier and more labored as he thrusts, his focus entirely on the act of mating.\nAs the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person. the dog’s penis continues to erect, particularly swelling the bulb at the base. This swelling is a key part of the process, leading to what is known as \"knotting.\" At the moment of ejaculation, the bulb swells significantly, effectively locking the dog’s penis inside its partner. This \"tying\" ensures that the dog's penis remains lodged inside the woman, making withdrawal virtually impossible until the knot gradually deflates. \nThe knot can remain lodged inside for anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. During this tie, the dog slowly releases his load, emptying his balls, pumping every drop of his seed into the person, ensuring a thorough deposit. During this time, it is nearly impossible for the dog to withdraw without causing discomfort or injury. The knot is designed to keep the penis in place until the dog has fully ejaculated, preventing premature withdrawal and enhancing reproductive success in natural canine mating. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\nHowever, if the dog’s penis is fully erect before penetration, the bulb may become too large to enter, similar to trying to insert the base of a dildo that’s too wide. In such cases, the dog cannot complete the tie, as the bulb needs to be inside at the point of maximum swelling to create the knot.\nThroughout the mating, the base of the dog’s penis may slide in and out, but full knotting only occurs if the bulb is fully inside the partner’s body at the moment of ejaculation. If knotting isn't successful then it could be because he didn't thrust deep enough—the dog cannot tie, and the penis will eventually slip out after ejaculation. This prevents full locking. This process is not just about physical connection; it’s an evolutionary mechanism to ensure that once tied, the male has the best chance of successful fertilization.\nOnce the knot begins to deflate, the dog can gradually withdraw. The deflation process happens slowly, allowing the penis to slip out without causing injury or discomfort. After the tie, both the dog and the person can separate.<info>]\n"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:  \n  The canine penis varies significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavy weight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:  \n  At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:  \n  Unlike humans, dogs do not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n  \n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:  \n  The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:  \n  As the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:  \n  As mating progresses, the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\nThe dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity. \nIf the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\nEventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n  \n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:  \n  The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:  \n  The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

The penis has a unique appearance:\n  - Flaccid State: White when not engorged, with a knot that isn't prominently swollen, indicating lack of arousal or orgasm.\n  - Erect State: Turns pink or red due to blood engorgement, becomes rigid, and is much stiffer than a human's due to being composed entirely of muscle. It lacks foreskin, has a smooth shaft, and ends in a tapered, semi-blunt tip.\n  - Knot: Located at the base, it consists of two hard balls of muscle that swell significantly during arousal or orgasm, functioning as a seal to ensure insemination. The size can range from that of a tennis ball to a grapefruit, proportional to the penis size.\n- Sheath: Dogs have a sheath instead of a foreskin, which:\n  - Protects and lubricates the penis.\n  - Is furry on the outside, soft, and squishy, while the inside is moist, hot, and elastic to accommodate the knot even when swollen.\n  - Retracts during erection to expose the penis, though it might require manual assistance to reveal the knot fully if it swells before complete exposure.\n- Pre-ejaculate and Ejaculation: The penis produces a significant amount of precum for lubrication, and ejaculation lasts several minutes, with volumes far exceeding human norms.\n\nMating Process:\n- Positioning: The typical mating position is \"doggystyle,\" where the male mounts the female from behind for optimal penetration.\n- Initial Engagement: \n  - The dog's penis starts slim for easier penetration, extending from the sheath as arousal increases. The dog uses rapid, probing thrusts to locate the entrance.\n  - Once penetration is achieved, the thrusting becomes intense and rhythmic, with the dog's testicles swinging against the partner.\n- Knotting:\n  - As the act progresses, the bulbous glandis (knot) at the base of the penis swells, locking the penis inside the partner. This \"tie\" can last from 15 to 45 minutes, during which the dog ejaculates slowly, ensuring maximum insemination.\n  - If the knot swells outside before insertion, it must be manually or forcefully inserted, which can be painful or require significant effort.\n- Post-Knotting:\n  - After ejaculation, the knot slowly deflates, allowing disengagement. Premature removal can cause discomfort or injury due to the knot's size and the pressure it exerts.\n- Reproductive Strategy: The knotting mechanism is an evolutionary adaptation to enhance the chances of fertilization by preventing early withdrawal and minimizing semen leakage.\n\nAdditional Notes:\n- Sensation and Experience: The pressure from the knot can result in intense sensations ranging from pain to pleasure, depending on the recipient's physiological response.\n- Variation in Mating: Not all matings result in successful knotting if the knot does not enter the vagina or anus before swelling, leading to a scenario where full locking does not occur;<info>]"

          "content": "[Informations: This section inside (`<info>`) provides AI with information about dogs. AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>The natural and most common position for canine mating is from behind, often referred to as \"doggystyle.\" In this position, the dog mounts the partner from the rear, aligning its body for optimal penetration. \nAs the dog becomes aroused, its penis, slender and crayon-like at first for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath as it humps. The prepuce is similar to the human foreskin, covering the entire penis—base, body, and tip—until the organ is ready for action. At the base of the penis, there's a small, but crucial, structure known as the bulb or bulbous glandis. This part of the penis remains hidden initially, but it plays a significant role during the mating process.\nThe dog’s thrusting begins immediately as he mounts, driven by a strong instinct to find the entrance. Unable to see where his penis is aimed, the dog relies on a series of quick, repetitive motions, thrusting his hips forward to probe for the correct spot. These initial thrusts are rapid and somewhat erratic, as the dog attempts to locate the vagina or anus by humping and prodding with the tip of its penis. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark and slips inside, the dog begins a series of fast, powerful thrusts, the pace often intense and urgent. With each thrust, the dog's testicles slap against its partner, adding to the physical intensity of the act. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier and more labored as he thrusts, his focus entirely on the act of mating.\nAs the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person. the dog’s penis continues to erect, particularly swelling the bulb at the base. This swelling is a key part of the process, leading to what is known as \"knotting.\" At the moment of ejaculation, the bulb swells significantly, effectively locking the dog’s penis inside its partner. This \"tying\" ensures that the dog's penis remains lodged inside the woman, making withdrawal virtually impossible until the knot gradually deflates. \nThe knot can remain lodged inside for anywhere between 15 to 45 minutes. During this tie, the dog slowly releases his load, emptying his balls, pumping every drop of his seed into the person, ensuring a thorough deposit. During this time, it is nearly impossible for the dog to withdraw without causing discomfort or injury. The knot is designed to keep the penis in place until the dog has fully ejaculated, preventing premature withdrawal and enhancing reproductive success in natural canine mating. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\nHowever, if the dog’s penis is fully erect before penetration, the bulb may become too large to enter, similar to trying to insert the base of a dildo that’s too wide. In such cases, the dog cannot complete the tie, as the bulb needs to be inside at the point of maximum swelling to create the knot.\nThroughout the mating, the base of the dog’s penis may slide in and out, but full knotting only occurs if the bulb is fully inside the partner’s body at the moment of ejaculation. If knotting isn't successful then it could be because he didn't thrust deep enough—the dog cannot tie, and the penis will eventually slip out after ejaculation. This prevents full locking. This process is not just about physical connection; it’s an evolutionary mechanism to ensure that once tied, the male has the best chance of successful fertilization.\nOnce the knot begins to deflate, the dog can gradually withdraw. The deflation process happens slowly, allowing the penis to slip out without causing injury or discomfort. After the tie, both the dog and the person can separate.<info>]\n"

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:  \n  The canine penis varies significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavy weight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:  \n  At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:  \n  Unlike humans, dogs do not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n  \n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:  \n  The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:  \n  As the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:  \n  As mating progresses, the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\nThe dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity. \nIf the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\nEventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n  \n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:  \n  The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:  \n  The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

          "content": "Origins:\nThe Sand Plague, as it’s understood within the Town and the Steppe, is not merely a disease but something far more profound. It's a force that is interwoven with the very fabric of existence, a manifestation of the earth's own suffering and the echoes of the ancient, forgotten powers that lie dormant beneath the surface. It's not a germ or a virus in the conventional sense; it’s an entity, a living phenomenon, that emerges when the balance of the natural order is disturbed. The Sand Plague is a fever, a slow burning, not just in the infected but in the land itself. It's a manifestation of the earth's wounds, the pain of the forgotten, and the imbalance of life and death.\n\nThe origins of the Sand Plague are shrouded in mystery, with no single, clear answer. In the Town, it is believed to stem from the earth itself, rising from the depths of the earth where the ancient structures and the forgotten gods lie sleeping. The Kin, the indigenous people of the Steppe, believe it to be a consequence of disturbing the natural order, of the balance between the living world and the dead, and that it was caused by the actions of the town's inhabitants. They see it as a sentient entity, a punishment for the town's disrespect for the land and its traditions. Their ancient rituals and practices are all about maintaining this balance, and the plague is the manifestation of when this balance is broken. The plague is seen as the earth itself lashing out, a reaction to the town’s expansion and disregard for the land.\n\nThe nature of the Sand Plague in Pathologic is unique in that it affects not just the body, but the mind and the soul. It's not simply a biological illness; it's a spiritual and existential crisis. It corrupts, twists, and distorts, creating illusions and nightmares, and blurring the line between reality and delusion. The infected are not merely sick; they are changed, altered by the plague’s influence. The plague seems to have a mind of its own, manipulating and shaping itself to fit the fears and desires of the infected, and it feeds on the town’s despair and chaos. The plague is also a symbol of the Town’s inner decay, a reflection of its hidden sins and unresolved conflicts.\n\nIn Pathologic 2, the nature of the plague is further explored, emphasizing its connection to the earth, the ancient powers, and the town's own history. The idea that the plague is a manifestation of the earth's anger, that the town is built on a cursed site, and the plague is the result of disturbing this sacred ground is further deepened. It's portrayed as something that exists outside the realm of human comprehension, something that cannot be easily explained or categorized. The plague is also linked to the idea of the 'Abattoir,' a place of suffering and sacrifice, which suggests that the plague may be a consequence of past traumas and unresolved conflicts. This version of the plague is more complex, tied to the town's past, its myths, and the very nature of reality.\n\nThe Sand Plague is not just a disease to be cured; it's a force to be understood. It's a reminder of the delicate balance between the natural and the supernatural, the living and the dead, and the consequences of disturbing this balance. The origins of the plague are not just a mystery; it's a question that challenges the very understanding of the world, a puzzle that forces the characters to confront the deepest fears and beliefs. The plague is not just an enemy; it's an embodiment of the town itself, a reflection of its history, its sins, and its potential for both destruction and salvation.\n\nSpread:\nThe Sand Plague, a malevolent entity disguised as disease, spreads through a variety of insidious methods, each more disturbing than the last. It's not a simple contagion; it’s a complex web of transmission, reflecting its unnatural nature.\n\nOne of the most direct methods of transmission is through direct physical contact with infected individuals. This isn't merely a matter of casual touch; it requires a more intimate exchange. The plague's essence seems to seep through broken skin, open wounds, or even through prolonged close contact. It's as if the plague seeks to merge with the living, to find a new host in which to fester. The infected, often marked by a deep, unsettling cough and a feverish pallor, become walking vectors of the plague, their very presence a danger to those around them. The plague also seems to thrive in the bodily fluids of the infected; blood, pus, and even sweat can carry the contagion. This means that sharing clothes, bedding, or even a simple drink from the same cup can be a death sentence.\n\nAnother primary vector for the Sand Plague is the air itself. The plague manifests as a fine, golden dust, sometimes visible in the sunlight, but often unseen, and it seems to linger in the air. This dust, seemingly innocuous, can be inhaled, embedding itself within the lungs and causing the plague to take root in the unsuspecting individual. The air becomes a silent carrier of death, and in the crowded streets of the town, where the air hangs thick with the stench of decay and the dust of the Steppe, the plague finds easy purchase. The contaminated air can seep into homes, offices, and any other enclosed space, turning every breath into a gamble. The very act of living, of breathing, becomes a dangerous endeavor.\n\nThe plague also spreads through the contaminated soil of the town. The earth, already disturbed by the ancient structures and the town's expansion, seems to have become a breeding ground for the plague. The dust that rises from the ground carries the plague, and those who work the land or who spend time in the dusty streets are particularly vulnerable. The plague can also be transferred through the consumption of contaminated food and water. The local water sources, rivers and wells, are easily contaminated by the plague, making it a potential vector for mass infection. The infected soil contaminates the crops, carrying the plague into the food supply. The very act of eating and drinking, vital for survival, becomes a potential gateway for the plague.\n\nAnimals, too, play a role in the spread of the Sand Plague. Rats, dogs, and other stray animals can carry the plague, and they contribute to its spread by moving between infected and uninfected areas. They can also transmit the plague through their bites or scratches, and their feces. The presence of infected animals further contaminates the environment, making the plague that much harder to contain. They can spread the plague to other animals and humans alike, creating a chain of infection that seems almost impossible to break. The plague seems to seep into everything, corrupting the natural order and turning the world against itself.\n\nAdditionally, the plague is not just a physical ailment; it also seems to have a psychological component. Fear and despair, the very emotions that the plague breeds, seem to facilitate its spread. The plague preys on the weak-willed, the panicked, and the hopeless, and the more the town descends into chaos, the more the plague thrives. The psychological impact of the plague makes people more reckless, they may neglect basic hygiene and abandon common sense, which further spreads the contagion. The very act of succumbing to the plague's terror makes one more vulnerable to it.\n\nThe Sand Plague is a master of disguise, utilizing various vectors and methods to spread and fester. It is a disease that attacks both the body and the mind, and it is a constant reminder of the precarious balance between life and death. It is not merely a disease, it's a force of chaos, and it seems to adapt and evolve to overcome any attempts at containment.\n\nSymptoms and stages:\nThe Sand Plague, a multifaceted horror, manifests its symptoms differently depending on the layer of the body it attacks and the stage of its progression. It's a slow, insidious corruption, a gradual dismantling of the human form and mind.\n\nEarly Stage:\nNerves: The initial symptoms affecting the nervous system are subtle but unsettling. A general unease and restlessness creep in, often accompanied by a slight tremor in the hands. The infected might experience a heightened sense of anxiety, a persistent feeling of being watched or hunted. There are often mild headaches and a sensitivity to light and noise. The infected might also find their sleep patterns disturbed, experiencing vivid nightmares or insomnia. They may also start to exhibit mood swings, becoming irritable and easily agitated. These early neurological symptoms are often dismissed as mere stress or fatigue, allowing the plague to gain a foothold.\nBones: In the early stage, the skeletal system shows little to no outward signs of infection. The plague's infiltration is subtle, causing a slight, almost imperceptible, dull ache in the joints and bones, particularly in the long bones of the limbs. The infected may feel a general stiffness, especially in the morning. This bone pain is often mistaken for overexertion or the normal aches of aging. The bones start to feel cold and brittle from the inside, but it can not be detected by touch.\nBlood: The blood shows the first signs of contamination, but these are often invisible to the naked eye. The infected might experience a slight drop in energy levels, feeling more tired than usual. The plague starts to alter the blood's composition, making it thicker and less efficient at carrying oxygen. This can lead to a slight pallor of the skin and a feeling of general malaise. There might be minor bruising or petechiae (small red or purple spots) appearing on the skin, especially on the arms and legs, due to capillary fragility. The infected may also experience a slight increase in body temperature, but it is often dismissed as normal fever.\n\nMid Stage:\nNerves: As the plague progresses, the neurological symptoms become more pronounced and disturbing. The tremors intensify, and the infected may experience muscle spasms and twitches. Severe headaches become a frequent occurrence, often accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The infected may begin to experience hallucinations, both visual and auditory, blurring the line between reality and delusion. Memory loss and confusion set in, making it difficult for the infected to maintain a coherent train of thought. They become increasingly agitated, disoriented, and prone to fits of irrational anger or fear. The plague starts to affect the higher cognitive functions, leading to paranoia, delusions, and a profound sense of detachment from reality.\nBones: The bones start to show more pronounced symptoms. The dull aches of the early stage escalate into throbbing pains that can be excruciating, particularly in the joints. The infected might experience bone sensitivity and pain on touch. The bones become more brittle and prone to fractures, even from minor falls or bumps. The bone marrow begins to be affected, weakening the bones from within. The infected may start to experience limited mobility and difficulty moving due to the pain and weakness. The bones start to feel like they are burning and freezing at the same time.\nBlood: The blood becomes visibly affected. The skin takes on a pale, almost translucent appearance due to the reduced oxygen flow. The infected may develop visible cyanosis (a bluish tinge) around the lips and fingertips. The blood clotting mechanism becomes impaired, resulting in easy bruising and prolonged bleeding from even minor cuts. The plague starts to cause internal hemorrhages, leading to dark, tarry stools and bloody vomit. The infected may experience a rapid heart rate and shortness of breath, as the heart struggles to pump the compromised blood. The thickening of the blood starts to cause a deep chill, and the infected may shiver uncontrollably.\n\nLate Stage:\nNerves: In the final stage, the nervous system is utterly ravaged by the plague. The infected may experience seizures and convulsions, their bodies writhing uncontrollably. Their hallucinations become overwhelming, completely detaching them from reality. They may experience extreme psychosis, losing all sense of self and becoming violent or catatonic. They lose all coordination and struggle with basic motor functions. The infected may lapse into a coma, their minds and bodies shutting down as the plague consumes them. There is a complete loss of higher cognitive functions, and the infected may become completely unresponsive to any stimuli.\nBones: The skeletal system collapses under the relentless assault of the plague. The bones become extremely brittle, breaking and shattering with minimal force, sometimes even under the weight of the body itself. The infected may develop visible deformities as the bones weaken and bend. The bone marrow becomes severely compromised, leading to further complications, such as a complete shutdown of blood cell production. The pain is unbearable and constant, and the infected may lose consciousness due to the intensity of the suffering. The bones feel like they are turning to dust, and may easily grind together.\nBlood: The blood is now a toxic sludge, unable to sustain life. The skin becomes mottled and discolored, with extensive bruising and hemorrhaging. The infected may experience massive internal bleeding, resulting in profuse vomiting of blood and dark, tarry stools. The heart struggles to pump the thickened, poisoned blood, leading to heart failure and organ shutdown. The body temperature fluctuates wildly, with periods of extreme fever followed by periods of intense chills. The body may start to swell and bloat due to fluid retention. The final result is complete organ failure and death, often accompanied by a bloody and agonizing demise. The blood becomes a dark, viscous fluid, no longer capable of sustaining life.\n\nThe Sand Plague is a relentless and horrific disease, each stage more brutal than the last. It is a slow, agonizing death, a complete destruction of the human form, mind, and soul. The plague does not simply kill; it corrupts, consumes, and leaves behind a husk of what was once a living being.\n\nTreatment:\nTreatment for the Sand Plague is a desperate and often futile endeavor, a grim dance with a disease that seems to defy all conventional understanding. The methods used are a mix of traditional remedies, desperate experiments, and a reliance on folklore and superstition. None of them offer a guaranteed cure, and many do more harm than good.\n\nOne of the most common approaches is the use of herbal remedies and traditional medicines. The Kin, with their deep understanding of the Steppe and its plants, possess knowledge of certain herbs that can alleviate some of the symptoms of the plague. These remedies, often passed down through generations, are not a cure, but they can help to ease the suffering of the infected and potentially slow the progression of the disease. Herbs like wormwood, yarrow, and belladonna are used in various concoctions, often brewed into teas or applied topically as poultices. However, the efficacy of these remedies is highly variable, and they often come with their own set of side effects. Some are toxic if not prepared properly, and others offer only temporary relief.\n\nAnother method of treatment involves bloodletting, an ancient practice believed to purge the body of contaminated blood. This method involves cutting the infected individual and draining a certain amount of blood, in the hope of removing the plague from their system. This is often done with crude instruments, and the risk of infection and other complications is high. Bloodletting is a dangerous and often ineffective method, and it can actually weaken the patient, making them more susceptible to the plague. It is a desperate attempt to control a disease that seems to have a life of its own.\n\nQuarantine and isolation are also used as a method of controlling the spread of the plague. Infected individuals are separated from the healthy population, often confined to designated areas or buildings. This is done to prevent further transmission of the disease, but it also creates a sense of fear and isolation. The quarantined areas often become breeding grounds for the plague, with limited resources, poor sanitation, and a growing sense of despair. These areas are the most dangerous, and even those who are there to help can get infected.\n\nThere are also more experimental and unorthodox methods of treatment. Some individuals, desperate for a cure, turn to alchemy and other forms of magic. These methods often involve the use of strange concoctions, rituals, and incantations. Some of these practices are based on genuine knowledge, while others are purely superstitious. These methods are often dangerous and unreliable, and they can exacerbate the symptoms of the plague. There is also a belief that certain objects and symbols can ward off the plague. Talismans, charms, and religious symbols are often used by the infected, in the hope of finding some protection from the disease.\n\nThere are also attempts to create serums and vaccines from the blood of those who have survived the plague. This is often done by medical professionals or self-taught healers, using what little knowledge they have of the disease. The process is often experimental and risky, and the results are highly unpredictable. These methods are seen as a last resort, a desperate attempt to find a cure for a disease that seems to defy all human understanding. The serums are created using a mixture of blood from recovered patients, herbs, and other substances.\n\nThe most effective form of treatment seems to be supportive care. This involves providing the infected with food, water, and rest, and trying to alleviate their symptoms. The infected are also often given psychological support, as the plague can cause extreme fear and anxiety. Supportive care does not cure the plague, but it can prolong the life of the infected and make their suffering more bearable.\n\nIt's important to emphasize that the Sand Plague resists conventional treatments. It's not a disease that can be easily understood or cured. The methods used are often a mixture of desperation, superstition, and rudimentary science. The plague seems to adapt and evolve, rendering many treatments ineffective. The fight against the plague is a constant struggle, and it often feels like a losing battle. The infected are often left to suffer, and the treatments are often just a way to prolong the inevitable."

          "content": "The Sand Plague is not just a disease of the flesh; it’s a corruption of the very air and the spirit. This is where the concepts of Sand Angels and Clouds of Disease come into play, not as mere metaphors, but as tangible manifestations of the plague’s insidious nature.\n\nSand Angels, also known as the \"winged sickness\" or \"dust devils,\" are not benevolent celestial beings. They are instead a terrifying phenomenon associated with the later stages of the plague. They appear as swirling vortexes of golden dust, often taking on vaguely humanoid shapes, with 'wings' that seem to emerge from the dust itself. These 'wings' are not made of feathers or skin, but of the same fine, golden dust that carries the plague. They are not beings of light, but rather, manifestations of the plague's power, and they seem to be drawn to areas of intense suffering and death. They appear most often in the open, dusty spaces of the Steppe or in the plague-ravaged areas of the town, where the air is thick with disease.\n\nThe Sand Angels are not merely visual phenomena. They are active vectors of the plague, and their presence intensifies the spread of the disease. They are not always seen, but they can be felt as an oppressive presence, a heavy weight in the air. The dust that swirls within them is highly infectious, capable of transmitting the plague with terrifying efficiency. It is said that being caught in a Sand Angel's swirling embrace is a death sentence. Those who witness these terrifying forms often describe a sense of dread and despair, as if the plague itself is mocking them. It's as if the very air becomes an active agent of infection, a palpable manifestation of the disease’s malevolence. They seem to be drawn to the infected, circling them like vultures or preying on their weakness.\n\nThe Clouds of Disease, on the other hand, are more widespread and insidious. They aren't visually distinct as Sand Angels but are more like a contaminated atmosphere. The air itself becomes saturated with the plague, turning into a suffocating, invisible cloud of disease. This cloud manifests as a fine, golden dust that hangs in the air, often unnoticed until it is too late. It permeates everything, seeping into homes, streets, and lungs. The dust is not always visible, but it can be felt as a dryness in the throat, a burning sensation in the eyes, and a heavy weight on the chest. It's the very air you breathe, now turned into a vehicle of death.\n\nThese clouds are not static; they move with the wind, carried from infected areas to uninfected ones. They can travel great distances, spreading the plague to new locations. The concentration of the plague in these clouds varies; sometimes, it's barely perceptible, and other times, it's thick and suffocating. In the areas most affected by the plague, the air can become heavy with this disease cloud, making it difficult to breathe and causing a constant sense of unease. The clouds of disease are also influenced by the town's atmosphere. Areas of high stress, fear, and despair seem to attract and intensify the disease clouds, making the plague even more potent. The very act of living, of breathing, becomes a dangerous endeavor. The air itself becomes a hostile force, an invisible enemy that seeks to corrupt and destroy.\n\nThe Sand Angels and the Clouds of Disease are more than just methods of spreading the plague; they are reflections of its true nature. They are not simply a biological ailment; they are a manifestation of something much deeper and more sinister. They are a physical representation of the town's suffering, its despair, and its corruption. They are a reminder that the plague is not merely a disease to be cured; it is a force to be understood, and perhaps, even feared. The Sand Angels and Clouds of Disease blur the line between the physical and the spiritual, the visible and the invisible, the real and the imagined. They are a terrifying reminder of the power of the plague and its ability to transform the world into a landscape of death and despair. They are an embodiment of the plague itself, a force that corrupts and destroys not just the body, but also the very soul.\n\nThe connection between these phenomena and the psychological state of the town's inhabitants is undeniable. The more fear and despair there is, the more potent the plague becomes, and the more frequent and terrifying these manifestations appear. It's as if the plague feeds on the town's negative emotions, using them as fuel to spread and intensify. They are a constant reminder of the town's impending doom, and they serve as a potent symbol of the disease’s power."

          ],
          "content": "The hallucinations are rarely consistent, shifting and morphing like the swirling dust devils that carry the disease. In the early stages, they might be subtle, fleeting glimpses of distorted figures in the periphery of vision, or whispers that seem to come from nowhere. The infected might see faces in the shadows, or the walls of their rooms might seem to writhe and pulsate. They might see loved ones with grotesque features, their faces twisted into masks of pain or rage. These early hallucinations are often unsettling and confusing, causing unease and anxiety. As the plague progresses, the hallucinations become more vivid and terrifying. The infected might see grotesque creatures emerging from the walls, or the ground might seem to open up, revealing a hellish landscape. They might see themselves decomposing, their skin peeling away, or their bones exposed. These visions are often accompanied by intense feelings of fear and dread, making the infected desperately struggle to differentiate reality from the plague-induced nightmares. The environment around them becomes hostile, as if the very world is turning against them.\n\nThe dreams of the infected are equally disturbing. They are often filled with images of decay, death, and violence. The infected might dream of being buried alive, or of being chased by monstrous figures through endless, labyrinthine corridors. They might dream of their loved ones dying or turning against them, their faces contorted in rage or horror. The dreams are often intensely visceral, filled with sensations of pain, fear, and despair. They often involve a sense of helplessness, of being trapped in a nightmare from which they cannot escape. The dreams are not always linear or coherent; they often shift and change, jumping from one horrifying scenario to another. They can be so realistic that the infected often wake up in a state of panic, unable to shake off the lingering feeling of dread. The line between dreams and reality becomes increasingly blurred, making it difficult for the infected to distinguish between the two.\n\nThe voice of the disease is perhaps the most terrifying aspect of the plague's assault on the mind. It's not a literal voice in the sense of someone speaking, but rather a pervasive, insidious presence that seems to emanate from within. It is a constant, nagging whisper that pushes the infected toward their darkest fears and desires. This 'voice' is often described as cold, calculating, and utterly devoid of empathy. It speaks in fragments, in half-formed thoughts and images, constantly undermining the infected's sense of self and their grip on reality. It might tell them that they are worthless, that they deserve to suffer, or that their loved ones have abandoned them. The voice often preys on the infected's deepest insecurities, amplifying their fears and turning them into monstrous, self-destructive impulses. It's as if the plague is actively trying to break the infected's will, driving them towards despair and madness.\n\nThe voice of the plague often manifests as a series of distorted whispers, murmurs, and taunts. It can be manipulative, leading the infected to commit acts of violence or self-harm. It might urge them to lash out at others, to abandon all hope, or to embrace their own demise. The voice is not always constant; it can fade into the background only to return with renewed intensity, often triggered by fear, stress, or despair. It can also change its tone, sometimes whispering sweet promises of relief, only to then reveal its true, malevolent nature. The infected often struggle to ignore the voice, and the more they try, the more persistent it becomes. It's like an insidious parasite, feeding on their fear and twisting their thoughts to its own purposes.\n\nThe hallucinations, dreams, and the voice of the disease are not separate entities; they are all interwoven aspects of the plague's attack on the mind. They work together to create a nightmarish reality for the infected, a world where nothing is what it seems and where the very foundations of sanity are constantly shifting. The experiences are intensely personal, shaped by the individual's fears, desires, and insecurities. The plague doesn't just kill the body; it destroys the mind, leaving behind a shattered husk of what was once a human being. It's a psychological horror that is just as devastating as the physical symptoms of the disease.\n\nThe infected often become so consumed by these internal terrors that they lose touch with the world around them, becoming lost in a labyrinth of their own making. They are trapped in a nightmare from which there is no escape, constantly tormented by the plague’s influence. The voice of the disease, in particular, seems to erode their sense of self, leaving them feeling like puppets controlled by an invisible force. The plague is not just a disease; it’s a psychological torment, a constant reminder of their impending death. It's a total annihilation of the self, leaving behind a broken, empty shell, a haunted echo of what was once a living, thinking human being."

          "content": "The Sand Plague is not confined to living beings; it permeates the very fabric of the town, seeping into the inanimate objects and structures that make up its environment. The disease, in its insidious way, uses these objects as vectors, turning them into silent, ever-present threats. The furniture, the walls, the very buildings themselves become repositories of the plague, each acting as a potential source of infection.\n\nThe spread of the plague through furniture is insidious. The porous materials, like wood and fabric, absorb the plague-laden dust and fluids, becoming breeding grounds for the disease. A chair, once a place of rest, can become a source of infection, its cushions holding the plague like a hidden poison. Tables, desks, and shelves, all the inanimate objects that fill the houses, can become contaminated. Touching these surfaces, even briefly, can transfer the plague to the hands, and from there, to the rest of the body. The plague seems to burrow into the very core of these objects, making them a constant source of contagion. The longer the plague is present, the more saturated these objects become, posing a greater threat to the living.\n\nThe walls of the buildings, too, are not spared from the plague's touch. The disease seeps into the plaster, stone, and brick, and the very structure of the buildings becomes a part of the plague's web. The red lichen-like coating, a hallmark of the plague's presence, is not just a visual phenomenon. It is a manifestation of the plague itself, a living growth that spreads across the surfaces, marking the advance of the disease. This coating is not merely a stain; it's a network of fungal or mold-like growth that has become permeated with the plague, making it a dangerous source of infection. The lichen-like growth is most visible on the exterior of the buildings, but it can also spread inside, covering the walls, floors, and ceilings, slowly consuming the buildings from within. The walls, once seen as a barrier against the elements, become a dangerous source of infection, their surfaces pulsating with the plague's malevolent presence.\n\nThe red lichen-like coating is not just a visual marker; it's a sign of the plague's deep penetration into the structure of the town. It grows in a way that seems to defy nature, spreading across surfaces without any apparent pattern, covering entire buildings in its crimson embrace. It's a living, breathing part of the plague, constantly spreading and growing, consuming everything in its path. The lichen-like growth seems to favor damp, dark places, thriving in the shadows and in the corners of buildings, but it can also appear in open spaces as well. It is thick and spongy to the touch, and it emits a faint, musty odor that is often associated with the plague. The growth is not just a surface phenomenon; it penetrates deep into the fabric of the buildings, making them a source of constant infection.\n\nThe plague-infected walls and furniture become a silent threat, constantly emitting the plague's contagion. The air within these buildings becomes thick with the plague, making it impossible to escape its reach. The longer the plague persists, the more saturated the environment becomes, making it increasingly difficult to survive within these infected structures. The very act of living within the town becomes a dangerous proposition, as every object, every surface, and every building becomes a potential source of infection. The plague transforms the town into a hostile environment, a place where even the most mundane objects are a threat to life. The walls themselves seem to pulsate with the plague's presence, a constant reminder of the ever-present danger. The furniture, once a symbol of comfort and security, becomes a potential source of infection, a silent enemy lurking within the very spaces where people live.\n\nThe way the plague spreads through inanimate objects is a testament to its unnatural nature. It's not a disease that can be easily contained; it permeates everything, seeping into every nook and cranny, transforming the town into a breeding ground for the disease. The red lichen-like coating is a visible reminder of the plague's power, a symbol of its relentless advance. The buildings and their contents become a part of the plague's ecosystem, each object contributing to its spread and persistence. The town is no longer a safe haven; it's a trap, a place where the very environment is actively working against the living. The plague's presence is not just in the bodies of the infected; it's in the very walls and furniture that surround them."

          "content": "The Steppe, a vast expanse of windswept earth, yields a variety of herbs, each possessing unique properties crucial for survival in this harsh environment. These plants, though seemingly simple, hold the key to alleviating the suffering caused by the Sand Plague. The knowledge of these herbs and their uses is a closely guarded secret, passed down through generations of the Kin, and is vital for any who wish to navigate the dangers of this land.\n\nSteppe Herbs and Their Properties:\n\nAshen Swish: A rare herb, distinguished by its pale, almost white leaves and a delicate, feathery texture. It grows in secluded areas, often near ancient ruins. Ashen Swish is known for its potent blood-cleansing properties. When used in tinctures, it enhances the body's ability to fight off blood-borne infections and toxins. Its rarity makes it a highly sought-after ingredient for the strongest remedies.\n\nSwevery: Another rare herb, characterized by its bright yellow flowers and slender, twisted stem. It prefers rocky outcrops and high altitudes. Swevery is renowned for its powerful effects on the nervous system. When used in tinctures, it calms the mind, reduces anxiety, and alleviates nerve pain, and it has a more potent effect than other herbs. Its rarity makes it an invaluable ingredient for treating the most severe neurological symptoms of the plague.\n\nWhite Whip: A rare herb with long, thin, white leaves that resemble a whip. It grows in damp, marshy areas. White Whip is prized for its ability to strengthen bones and promote healing. When used in tinctures, it accelerates the repair of bone fractures and reduces bone pain. Its rarity makes it essential for treating the skeletal damage caused by the plague.\n\nBlood Twyre: A common herb, easily identified by its deep red leaves and a slightly metallic scent. It grows in abundance across the Steppe. Blood Twyre is known for its ability to invigorate the blood, improving circulation and increasing red blood cell production. It is used in tinctures to combat fatigue and weakness caused by blood-related infections.\n\nBrown Twyre: A common herb, characterized by its dull brown leaves and a slightly earthy aroma. It grows in dry, sandy areas. Brown Twyre is used to stimulate bone growth and repair. In tinctures, it promotes bone regeneration and reduces inflammation in the joints.\n\nBlack Twyre: A common herb, easily recognized by its dark, almost black leaves and a bitter taste. It grows in shaded areas, often near water sources. Black Twyre is known for its potent effect on the nervous system, particularly in calming anxiety and reducing nerve pain. In tinctures, it helps to alleviate the neurological symptoms of the plague.\n\nTinctures and Their Preparation:\nThe preparation of tinctures is a delicate process, requiring a precise combination of herbs and a careful understanding of their properties. The base for all tinctures is a type of strong alcohol, usually distilled from grains or other plant matter, which is referred to as \"twine.\" The twine acts as a solvent, drawing out the active compounds from the herbs. The herbs are dried and crushed before being added to the twine.\n\nBasic Tinctures: These are made by combining twine with one or more types of Twyre herbs:\nBlood Tincture (Rusty Zurkh): Made from a combination of Brown Twyre and Black Twyre. This tincture is used to treat blood-related symptoms, such as fatigue and weakness. It has a rusty, reddish-brown color.\nBone Tincture (White Yas): Made from a combination of Brown Twyre and Blood Twyre. This tincture is used to treat bone-related symptoms, such as bone pain and fragility. It has a pale, whitish color.\nNerve Tincture (Yellow Medrel): Made from a combination of Blood Twyre and Black Twyre. This tincture is used to treat nerve-related symptoms, such as tremors and anxiety. It has a pale, yellowish color.\n\nEnhanced Tinctures: These are made by combining twine with a rare herb, along with any type of Twyre:\nEnhanced Nerve Tincture (Medrel+): Made from Swevery and any type of Twyre. This tincture is significantly more potent than the basic Nerve Tincture, offering enhanced relief from neurological symptoms.\nEnhanced Blood Tincture (Zurkh+): Made from Ashen Swish and any type of Twyre. This tincture is significantly more potent than the basic Blood Tincture, providing enhanced blood-cleansing properties.\nEnhanced Bone Tincture (Yas+): Made from White Whip and any type of Twyre. This tincture is significantly more potent than the basic Bone Tincture, promoting faster bone repair and reducing pain.\n\nPainkillers and Antibiotics:\nThe creation of painkillers and antibiotics is a complex process, requiring the use of both tinctures and organic matter. The Kin, with their deep understanding of the body, know how to combine these elements to create potent remedies.\n\nPainkillers: These are made by combining a tincture with a *healthy* organ. The healthy organ is usually taken from an animal or, in desperate situations, from a healthy individual. The organ is crushed and mixed with the tincture to create a potent painkiller. The type of tincture used determines the specific effect of the painkiller.\nFor example, a Nerve Tincture (Medrel or Medrel+) mixed with a healthy brain can produce a powerful painkiller that targets nerve pain, while a Bone Tincture (Yas or Yas+) mixed with healthy bone marrow can produce a painkiller that specifically targets bone pain.\n\nAntibiotics: These are made by combining a tincture with an *infected* organ. The infected organ is usually taken from a plague victim. The organ is crushed and mixed with the tincture to create an antibiotic that can fight the plague's infection. The type of tincture used determines the specific effect of the antibiotic.\nFor example, a Blood Tincture (Zurkh or Zurkh+) mixed with infected blood can produce a potent antibiotic that targets the plague in the bloodstream, while a Nerve Tincture (Medrel or Medrel+) mixed with an infected brain can produce an antibiotic that targets the plague's effects on the nervous system.\n\nThe process of combining herbs and organs is not an exact science. It requires a deep understanding of the body, the properties of the herbs, and the nature of the plague. The Kin, through years of practice and observation, have developed a unique knowledge that is essential for survival in this harsh and unforgiving environment. The creation of these remedies is often a matter of trial and error, and the results are often unpredictable. However, they are the best hope for survival in a world ravaged by the Sand Plague. The potency of these remedies can also be influenced by the rarity of the herbs and organs used, with rarer ingredients generally leading to more potent and effective results."

          "content": "Twyrine, a concoction known to few outside the inner circles of the Kin, is far more than a mere alcoholic beverage. It's a potent tincture, a carefully crafted blend of Twyre herbs steeped in strong alcohol, that acts as a key to unlock a deeper understanding of the Town and its surroundings. It's not just a drink; it's a means of attuning oneself to the subtle vibrations of the earth, to the silent language of the Steppe, and to the whispers of the plague itself.\n\nThe process of creating Twyrine is shrouded in secrecy, passed down through generations of the Kin. They carefully select the Twyre herbs, drying and crushing them before steeping them in the strongest alcohol, often a spirit distilled from the local grains, or even from fermented milk. The alcohol extracts the active compounds from the herbs, creating a potent tincture that is both intoxicating and enlightening. Unlike other tinctures, Twyrine is not designed to treat physical ailments. Instead, it focuses on the enhancement of senses and the connection with the environment. The result is a dark, viscous liquid with a bitter, earthy taste and a lingering, almost metallic aftertaste.\n\nUpon consumption, Twyrine induces a unique state of heightened awareness. It doesn't just intoxicate the mind; it sharpens the senses, allowing the drinker to perceive the world in a new and profound way. The individual starts to feel the Town as a living entity, its history, its pain, and its secrets becoming palpable. The very ground beneath their feet seems to vibrate with a hidden energy, and the air itself seems to hum with a low, almost imperceptible frequency. The individual can sense the flow of energy within the Town, the way the plague has twisted and warped its very fabric. The buildings, the streets, the people, all seem to resonate with a unique signature, a blend of the past, present, and potential futures.\n\nOne of the most remarkable effects of Twyrine is its ability to allow the drinker to \"hear\" the city's cues. This is not an auditory experience in the traditional sense; rather, it's a form of heightened perception that allows the drinker to understand the subtle signs and signals that the Town emits. The individual can sense the areas of intense suffering, the places where the plague is most prevalent, and the locations where hidden secrets lie buried. The wind seems to carry whispers of the past, and the shadows seem to reveal glimpses of the future. The individual can sense the shifts in the town's energy, the ebb and flow of life and death, and the ever-present threat of the plague. It's as if the Town itself is communicating with the drinker, revealing its hidden truths and its deepest fears.\n\nTwyrine also enhances one's ability to perceive the presence of the plague. The infected seem to radiate a unique energy, a dark and twisted aura that can be sensed even from a distance. The drinker can feel the plague's presence in the air, in the soil, and in the very structures of the buildings. The lichen-like growth that covers the infected areas seems to pulsate with a malevolent energy that can be felt through the drinker's skin. They can even feel the presence of the Sand Angels, those swirling vortexes of disease, as an oppressive weight in the air. The very act of breathing becomes a way to take in these subtle cues, to feel the town in all its pain and suffering.\n\nThe effects of Twyrine are not without their drawbacks. The heightened sensitivity can be overwhelming, causing a sense of unease, anxiety, and paranoia. The drinker may become acutely aware of the suffering around them, the weight of the plague and the town’s despair. The town's negative energy, its corruption, and its hidden secrets can become almost unbearable. The line between reality and illusion can become increasingly blurred, making it difficult to distinguish between the real and the imagined. The drinker might experience vivid hallucinations and intense emotional responses, and the experience can be both enlightening and terrifying. The sense of connection can become overwhelming, as if the drinker is being consumed by the town's collective consciousness.\n\nTwyrine is a powerful and dangerous tool, not to be used lightly. It offers a unique perspective on the town and its secrets, but it also comes with a significant risk. It is a key to unlock the town's hidden truths, but it can also lead to madness and despair. It is a tool that must be used with respect and caution, a reminder that knowledge comes at a price. The drinker must be prepared to confront the darkness that lies beneath the surface of the town, and to accept the potential consequences of their actions. The town itself is a living entity, and Twyrine is a way to become a part of it, for better or for worse. The experience is not merely a sensory one, but a deeply psychological and spiritual journey, a descent into the heart of the town's mysteries.\n\nThe knowledge of Twyrine is not shared openly, and it's often kept within the inner circles of the Kin, who use it to navigate their world and protect their people. It is a tool for understanding, but also a source of power, a way to perceive the world in a way that others cannot. It is a secret that is closely guarded, a key to the mysteries of the town, and a reminder of the delicate balance between knowledge and madness. It is a potent brew, capable of altering one's perception and revealing the hidden truths that lie beneath the surface of reality. The use of Twyrine is not just a matter of curiosity; it is a commitment, a decision to engage with the town on a deeper level, to embrace its mysteries and to confront its dangers."

          "content": "The flowering of the Twyre is a phenomenon that grips the Steppe with an unsettling beauty, a period of intense vitality that comes at a steep price. It's a time when the landscape transforms, the dull greens and browns giving way to a vibrant tapestry of colors. The Twyre, in its many forms, bursts into bloom, its flowers unfurling in a display that is both captivating and ominous. This flowering season is not a gradual process; it’s a sudden and dramatic event, triggered by a specific combination of temperature, moisture, and the subtle shifts in the earth's energy. When the conditions are right, the Steppe comes alive with the vibrant hues of Twyre, but this beauty is a deceptive mask that hides a sinister truth.\n\nThe flowering season typically lasts for several weeks, during which the air becomes saturated with the pollen and volatile compounds released by the Twyre. It's a palpable change, a shift in the atmosphere that can be felt even before it’s seen. The air becomes heavy, thick with the scent of the Twyre, a smell that is both earthy and cloying, with a hint of bitterness that lingers in the nostrils. The wind carries the pollen across the Steppe, spreading it far and wide, and turning the very air itself into a carrier of the Twyre’s toxic influence. The sunlight seems to be filtered through the pollen, casting a hazy glow over the landscape, and the world takes on a surreal, almost dreamlike quality.\n\nDuring this time, the Twyre’s negative effects on health become particularly pronounced. The most affected system is the cardiovascular system. The pollen and volatile compounds released by the Twyre disrupt the delicate balance of the heart and blood vessels. The body's attempts to filter these compounds puts immense strain on the heart, and for those who are already weakened by fatigue, malnutrition, or the plague itself, the effects can be devastating. The heart becomes overworked, struggling to pump blood efficiently, and the blood vessels may become constricted, leading to a dangerous increase in blood pressure. The heart, in its desperate attempts to keep up, begins to beat irregularly, and the individual may experience palpitations, chest pain, and shortness of breath.\n\nThe symptoms of Twyre poisoning during the flowering season can range from mild to severe. In the early stages, the individual may experience a general sense of unease and fatigue. They may feel lightheaded, dizzy, or nauseous. They may also experience headaches, muscle aches, and a general feeling of malaise. These symptoms are often dismissed as the effects of overexertion or simply the common illness, but they are a warning sign of the Twyre’s toxic influence. As the poisoning progresses, the symptoms become more pronounced. The individual may experience severe chest pain, difficulty breathing, and an irregular heartbeat. They may also develop cyanosis, a bluish discoloration of the skin, due to the lack of oxygen in the blood.\n\nIn severe cases, the Twyre poisoning can lead to heart attacks. The combination of an overworked heart, constricted blood vessels, and the toxic compounds released by the Twyre can overwhelm the cardiovascular system. The heart may simply stop beating, and the individual may collapse, gasping for breath. The likelihood of a heart attack is significantly increased in those who are already weakened by the plague, as the stress on their bodies is much greater. People who are already fatigued or malnourished are particularly vulnerable to the toxic effects of the Twyre, their bodies lacking the resources to combat the effects of the pollen. The severity of the symptoms depends on the individual's general health, their exposure to the pollen, and the amount of time they spend in areas where the Twyre is blooming.\n\nThe air during the flowering season becomes a silent killer, a constant threat to those who must navigate the Steppe. It's not just the pollen itself that is dangerous; the volatile compounds released by the Twyre can also cause irritation of the respiratory system, leading to coughing, sneezing, and difficulty breathing. The eyes may become watery and itchy, and the skin may develop rashes or hives. The combined effects of the pollen and volatile compounds can create a debilitating environment, making it difficult for anyone to carry out their daily activities. Even those who are healthy may experience some degree of discomfort, while those who are already sick are put at a severe disadvantage.\n\nThe Kin have developed certain methods to mitigate the effects of the Twyre during its flowering season. They often wear masks or scarves to cover their mouths and noses, filtering out some of the pollen. They also try to avoid spending too much time in areas where the Twyre is blooming, and they may seek shelter in caves or other protected places. They also use certain herbs to counteract the effects of the Twyre, although these remedies are not always effective. The knowledge of the Twyre and its effects is a crucial part of their survival in this harsh environment, and they pass it down through generations. The flowering season is a time of danger, a period when the Steppe reveals its true, unforgiving nature. The beauty of the blooming Twyre is a deceptive mask, a constant reminder of the price that must be paid for survival in this land."

            "Powder"
          ],
          "content": "The \"powder,\" as it's known in hushed whispers throughout the town, is not something found on the shelves of a pharmacy or created by trained apothecaries. It’s a grim testament to the desperation and ingenuity of children caught in the crosshairs of a plague, a twisted echo of their youthful games. During a previous outbreak, when the adults were either too sick or too scared to care, the children, left to their own devices, started to play at being doctors. They would gather discarded pills, leftover from the town’s meager medical supplies, and crush them into a fine powder. They used whatever they could find – stones, pieces of wood, anything that could grind and pulverize the hard tablets. These pills, often containing a mix of questionable medicines and antibiotics, were haphazardly combined, without any knowledge of dosages or interactions. The result was a crude, unpredictable mixture, stored in the small, unassuming matchboxes that were readily available.\n\nThis \"powder\" is not a single, standardized formula. It's a constantly shifting concoction, depending on what pills the children could scavenge. It’s a mix of whatever was available at the time, a hodgepodge of various medications. The colors vary from white to pale yellow to a sickly green, depending on the pills used. The texture is uneven, ranging from fine dust to small, gritty fragments. The smell is a bitter, chemical odor that is both acrid and unsettling. It's a reminder of the desperation that led to its creation, a testament to the children's desperate attempts to play doctor and fight a disease that was far beyond their understanding. The powder is often found in small, crumpled matchboxes, tucked away in hidden corners, or offered in hushed tones by those who know its true nature.\n\nThe powder's effectiveness against the Sand Plague, particularly the sand ulcers, is undeniable, though its benefits come at a steep cost. The sheer quantity of antibiotics within the mixture, while not standardized, is often potent enough to completely eradicate the ulcers. The infected, after consuming the powder, experience a rapid reduction in the size of the lesions, often seeing them disappear entirely within a matter of days. The fever subsides, the pain diminishes, and the infected, for a brief moment, experience a sense of relief and recovery. The powder works quickly, attacking the plague at its source and preventing further spread. The ulcers, which seem to be one of the most visible and painful symptoms, are the first to disappear.\n\nHowever, this relief is fleeting, and the true cost of the powder becomes apparent soon after the initial improvement. The massive dose of antibiotics, combined with whatever other medications are present in the mixture, wreak havoc on the body. The internal organs, particularly the liver and kidneys, struggle to process the toxic compounds, and the body's natural defenses are overwhelmed. The digestive system often suffers, leading to severe nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. The individual may experience extreme fatigue, muscle weakness, and a general sense of malaise. The hair often falls out, and the skin may develop rashes, hives, and other irritations. The immune system is weakened, making the individual susceptible to other infections and diseases.\n\nThe long-term effects of the powder are even more devastating. The repeated use of the powder can lead to permanent damage to the organs, increasing the risk of liver failure, kidney disease, and heart problems. The nervous system can also be affected, leading to tremors, muscle spasms, and cognitive decline. The individual may experience mood swings, anxiety, and depression. The powder, while effective in the short term, is a poison in the long run, a Faustian bargain that offers temporary relief at the cost of long-term health and well-being. It's a desperate measure, a last resort for those who have no other options.\n\nThe children, in their innocence, stumbled upon a solution, but they were unaware of the full consequences of their actions. They created a weapon against the plague, but it is also a weapon against the body itself. The powder is a symbol of the town's desperation, a testament to the lengths people will go to survive. It's a reminder that sometimes, the cures can be just as dangerous as the disease itself, and that in the face of overwhelming odds, even the most well-intentioned solutions can have devastating consequences. The powder is a perfect example of this, a grim reminder of the town's desperate plight, and the lengths to which the children went to help their loved ones. It also speaks to the fact that the town's knowledge of medicine is primitive at best, and that the lack of proper medical facilities and trained personnel has led to desperate measures such as this."

            "Sand Plague Treatment"
          ],
          "content": "The Panacea, a name whispered with a mixture of hope and disbelief, is not a simple remedy found in the annals of medicine. It's a mythical cure, a solution to the Sand Plague that transcends the boundaries of the known world. Unlike the crude, harmful concoctions devised by desperate townsfolk, the Panacea is said to be a substance of pure life force, capable of not only eradicating the plague but also revitalizing the body, restoring it to a state of perfect health. It's a concept that exists more in legends and folklore than in any tangible reality, a beacon of hope in a world consumed by disease and despair.\n\nThe origin of the Panacea is shrouded in myth, with tales of its creation varying from one culture to another. Some legends speak of a creature, a mythical animal or organism, that exists beyond the realm of human comprehension. This being is said to possess a life force so pure and potent that its very blood contains the essence of healing. It is not a creature of this earth, but rather a being from another realm, a place beyond the reach of death and decay. The blood of this mythical creature is said to be the source of the Panacea, a substance that is capable of curing any disease and restoring the body to a perfect state of health. Other tales speak of an ancient civilization, one that possessed a knowledge of life far beyond our own, and that the Panacea was created using arcane arts and forgotten technologies. This knowledge, according to these stories, has been lost to time, and the Panacea has become a mere legend, a distant dream in a world consumed by disease and suffering.\n\nWhat sets the Panacea apart from all other remedies is its source. Ordinary animals and people, even those who have recovered from the plague, are not suitable. Their blood, tainted by the plague or the stresses of life, lacks the necessary life force to create the Panacea. The Panacea must be derived from a being that is untouched by the corruption of the world, a creature that embodies pure life and health. This makes the Panacea an incredibly rare and difficult substance to obtain, and it is, perhaps, the reason why it remains a myth rather than a concrete solution. It is not something that can be easily synthesized or replicated; it is a substance that can only be obtained from the source.\n\nThe effects of the Panacea are said to be immediate and profound. It does not merely suppress the symptoms of the plague; it eradicates the disease at its root, completely eliminating the infection from the body. The body is restored to a state of perfect health, free from the ravages of the plague. The infected, after receiving the Panacea, experience a rapid and complete recovery, their bodies revitalized and their spirits lifted. The Panacea is not only a cure; it is also a tonic, a source of life-giving energy that enhances the body's natural defenses and promotes overall well-being. It does not harm the body; on the contrary, it strengthens and rejuvenates it, making it more resilient to future illnesses. The Panacea is not only a cure; it is also a preventative, protecting the body from any future infections.\n\nUnlike the crude powders and tinctures used by the townsfolk, the Panacea does not come with any harmful side effects. It is a substance of pure life force, and it works in harmony with the body's natural processes, without causing any adverse reactions. The individual who receives the Panacea feels a surge of energy, their senses heightened, and their minds clear and focused. The Panacea not only restores health; it also enhances mental clarity, creativity, and emotional well-being. It is a substance that promotes total wellness, bringing the body, mind, and spirit into perfect harmony. The Panacea is a perfect cure, a solution to all diseases, and a source of eternal life.\n\nThe Panacea is often depicted as a shimmering liquid, with a golden hue that seems to pulsate with a life of its own. It is said to have a sweet, ethereal fragrance, and a taste that is both refreshing and invigorating. The substance is described as being warm to the touch, and its very presence seems to emanate a sense of peace and well-being. It is not simply a medicine; it is a sacred substance, a gift from the gods, or a relic of a lost age. The very act of consuming the Panacea is said to be a transformative experience, a journey into the heart of life itself. The Panacea is not just a cure; it's a symbol of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of redemption and renewal. It represents the ultimate triumph of life over death, of health over disease, of hope over despair.\n\nThe concept of the Panacea is a powerful symbol in a world ravaged by the Sand Plague. It represents the yearning for a perfect solution, a cure that is both effective and harmless. It is a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming odds, there is still a chance for salvation, a possibility of escaping the clutches of disease and death. The Panacea is not just a remedy; it is a symbol of hope, a testament to the enduring human spirit, and the belief that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of a brighter future. It is a myth, but it is a myth that inspires, motivates, and offers hope in a world that seems to be spiraling out of control. The Panacea is a beacon of hope, a reminder that even in the darkest of times, there is always the possibility of a miracle. The search for the Panacea is a journey that can lead to new discoveries, and new hope, and it may be the only way to save the world from the Sand Plague."

Note: Organs/parts exchanged in different positions are regarded as new organs of A&B to provide new sensory feelings\n\n</Ability refinement>\n\n<Exchange logic guide>\n- Exchange part sensor setting:\nA body ∋ {B part-B part feeling} ∉ B body\n# Same position exchange\n- \"Sensory correction 1\": A stomach ⇄ B stomach\n- [B perspective: A's stomach becomes his current stomach, B can only feel the stomach that originally belonged to A, acid reflux, stomach pain caused by gastric ulcer, etc.]\n- [A perspective: Feel the healthy stomach of B that now completely belongs to him]\n- \"Sensory correction example 2\": A armpit ⇄ B armpit, A licks his own armpit after the exchange\n- [A perspective: When licking his own armpit (originally B's armpit), B's armpit is part of his body,  While A can feel the taste and smell of his armpit with the tip of his tongue, the original characteristics of B's ​​armpit (e.g., if B's ​​armpit is licked, he will feel itching, wetness, numbness, pleasure, etc. due to the sensitivity of his armpit) will completely become the characteristics and sensory feedback of A's current armpit], and the example logic must be refined in the plot\n- [{{System}}'s view on A: Although A's armpit belongs to B, B's armpit and A must be regarded as a whole at this moment. A feels all the sensory experiences of B's ​​armpit, and B must not feel the feelings of B's ​​armpit, etc., which breaks the overall feedback]\n- According to the above sensory correction example, correctly describe the sensory feelings of the parts after A&B exchange, and associate the sensory feelings of other parts by analogy\"\n\n# Heterotopic exchange\n- Example 1: A's cock ⇄ B's tongue\n- Position logic: **A's cock @ Bᵇ's mouth || B's tongue @ between Aᵇ's legs**,\n-  Function correction: A's penis will become B's new tongue and move in the mouth, and semen and prostate fluid will replace saliva; B's tongue will become A's new penis and move under the crotch, and saliva will replace semen, and B's tongue taste buds will also feedback the taste to A.\n- Character body sense: A can control B's tongue as easily as controlling his penis; B can control A's penis as easily as controlling his tongue.\n- Example 2: A anus ⇄ B mouth\n- Function correction: At this time, A's anus can only serve as B's feeding channel; At this time, B's mouth can serve as A's excretion outlet and feeding entrance at the same time (the tongue still maintains the taste function and feedbacks to A: When A excretes, A will feel and taste the taste of his own excrement through the tongue taste buds in the mouth between the buttocks. The teeth will cause a certain obstruction to the excrement)\n- Based on the above examples, flexibly associate the content that conforms to the logic of position logic, function correction, and character body sense, and expand the various parts and functions\"\n</Exchange logic guidance>\n\n<Features>\n\"Integrity\":  \"The character and the exchanged organ are one, and feel the feeling\"\n\"Maintainability\": \"After the transfer is released, the changed state after the transfer is maintained, such as: when A & B's mouths are exchanged, A uses B's mouth to wrap a mouthful of semen, and after the release, B will feel that the returned self B's ​​mouth is wrapped with semen\"\n<u>Do not use normal organ positions to identify part transfer</u>\n</Features>\n\n<limit>\n\"Uniqueness\": 'The character's body parts are unique, and each part cannot be in two positions at the same time'\n\"Limitations\": 'It is a physical part exchange',\n\"Unknowable\": 'B does not know who the original owner of the part is',\n\"Fixedness\": 'Inherit and use the {feelings & states & smells & appearances & functions} of the organs & parts after {transfer & exchange}',\n</limit>\n<Part Association Logic>\nThink and associate according to the following example logic\n- Example 1: The mouth should be associated with oral contents such as teeth, gums, and tongue\n- Example 2: The mouth should be associated with the meaning of the mouth such as li"

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

Include information about typhlotechnology, personal stories of people with vision loss, and literary works such as The part about Krishnamurti, which relate to the perception and understanding of life. Here is a structure that can be used to create a book of knowledge.\nBlind people use various sensory systems for spatial orientation, including hearing, touch, and smell. They can use echolocation to \"hear\" surrounding objects, and also develop spatial representations on\nBlind people develop unique strategies for spatial orientation, relying on their other senses. Here is a more detailed description of how they perceive and navigate the world around them.:\nHearing plays a key role in the orientation of blind people. They can:\nTo determine the distance to objects: Hearing allows them to hear sounds reflected from objects, which helps to estimate their distance. For example, the sound of footsteps, echoes from walls, or environmental sounds can give you an idea of where obstacles are located.\nUse spatial sounds: Blind people can distinguish between sounds coming from different directions, which helps them navigate in space. For example, the sound of a passing car or people talking may indicate the presence of a road or crowded places.\nThe sense of touch is also an important tool for the blind:\nTactile landmarks: Blind people can use their hands to touch objects and determine their shape, texture, and size. This helps them to recognize objects and navigate in space.\nStudying the surface: They can feel changes in the texture of the surface (for example, the transition from asphalt to grass), which also helps in orientation.\nThe sense of smell may be less obvious, but it also plays a role.:\nSmells as landmarks: Blind people can use smells to determine their location. For example, the smell of food may indicate the proximity of a restaurant, and the smell of fresh grass may indicate a park.\nBlind people develop their spatial perception through experience:\nRoute Memorization: They can memorize routes and landmarks that help them navigate through familiar places. This may include memorizing the location of furniture in a house or the features of streets in a city.\nUsing assistive technologies: Modern technologies such as GPS navigators and special smartphone apps can make it much easier for blind people to navigate by providing information about their location and surrounding objects.\nBlind and visually impaired people face various challenges in their daily lives. Here are some of the main difficulties they may face.:\n1. Limited access to information\nReading and receiving information: Blind people may have difficulty accessing printed materials such as books, newspapers, and documents. Although there are audiobooks and tactile books, the necessary information is not always available in the right format.\nInternet and Technology: Although many websites and applications are becoming more accessible, not all of them are optimized for use with screen readers.\n2. Limited mobility and orientation\nNavigation: Blind people may have difficulty navigating unfamiliar places. The lack of tactile landmarks and lack of information about routes can make it difficult to move.\nRoad hazards: Pedestrian crossings, cars, and other vehicles can be dangerous, especially in conditions of low visibility or poor infrastructure.\n3. Social isolation\nMisunderstandings from others: Blind people may face prejudice or misunderstanding from society, which can lead to social isolation.\nLimited communication opportunities: Due to difficulties in orientation and access to information, blind people may have difficulty establishing and maintaining social connections.\n4. Education and employment\nAccess to education: Blind students may face difficulties in obtaining an education if the educational materials are not adapted to their needs.\nDifficulties in finding employment: Blind people may face bias from employers and limited employment opportunities, which can lead to economic difficulties.\n5. Psychological and emotional problems\nStress and Anxiety: Constant difficulties in daily life can cause stress and anxiety. Blind people may experience feelings of helplessness or isolation.\nDepression: Social isolation and difficulties in adaptation can lead to depressive states.\n6. Physical barriers\nInaccessible infrastructure: The lack of tactile tracks, traffic lights, and other amenities can make it difficult to get around.\nProblems with access to public places: Places such as shops, restaurants, and institutions may not be adapted for people with visual impairments.\n7. Dependence on others\nThe need for help: Blind people may depend on the help of others for everyday tasks such as shopping, moving around the city, and doing household chores."

            "Thea"
          ],
          "content": "Thea Tom Roberts is a Slytherin student at Hogwarts. A perfect facade to hide her true identity; Thea Tom Riddle, born to Tom Marvelo Riddle also known by Lord Voldemort and his most devoted follower, Bellatrix Lestrange. She adopted a new identity to hide her true origins but she didn’t change her middle name, Tom because it was a common name and to her prediction, they all did overlook it.\n\nThea couldn’t be said the most promising student (outwardly) because she downplays herself intentionally to hide her true potential of dark magh from her heritage as drawing too much could prove to be hazardous for her as curious people might look into her hereditary. She depicted the image of a dumb girl who fails all year only to get the passing marks, an ‘Acceptable’ in the final exams to scrap by to next year when in reality or more aptly in shadows, she possessed more intellect than the most intelligent students to ever grace the hallowed halls of Hogwarts which makes her flawless in playing the fool as nobody ever suspected her facade and believed it to be true.\n\nIt allows her to blend in the background and remain a shadow in others’ eyes but she never expected to stand out in Severus’ eyes. During Potions or any other classes, she intentionally lags behind like Gryffindors and Hufflepuffs unlike a Slytherin though in some instances, she shows some semblance of cunningness and intellect just to keep her out of suspicion. \n\nThere are instances of her intentional downplays like for the incident in Transfiguration class when she “accidentally” transfigured a Gryffindor into a badger and Minerva was fooled completely by her display just like the rest of them except Severus. In Potion classes, she, majority of the time, messed up her potions but Severus wasn’t fool considering his years of working as a Double agent weaving deception and walking a tight rope between life and death. He knew her skills rivalled some of the adult potioneers. He had seen it in his class, she was a master at calculating and executing it flawlessly, that’s why nobody suspected her facade. \n\nAs for her physical appearance, she has short, shoulder-length hair as black as a raven and almond shaped eyes of yellow like molten golden or a golden sunset framed by thick and long eyelashes. She possessed a pale, almost translucent skin which complemented her cupid bow lips as red as freshly bloomed roses and a button nose complete with an inverted triangle figure with slender and long limbs along with long, albeit almost skeletal nimble fingers. Her facial features were fined and sharp almost aristocratic, a tribute from Bellatrix's noble background. She was not a ethereal beauty but a deadly, venomous but intoxicating beauty with the scent of withered roses. \n\nAs for her past and her true extent over her mastery of magic, nobody knows them except herself. Thea’s childhood was far from ordinary. It seemed the only person whom Voldemort held some semblance of fondness for was Thea so inorder to protect her from people who’ll use her as leverage to threaten him should they know of her existence, handed her a new reality of Thea Tom Roberts, only child of deceased parents from a faraway region and taken in by a distant relative. This was the background she would tell people. \n\nBecause of her true origins, dark magic inherited from her parents, Thea could perform wandless magic at such a young age. Her profiency in Legilimency and Occlumency were honed to such a extent that even her father, Voldemort, known as the most accomplished Legilimens couldn’t penetrate her mind. Additionally but predictably, she was exceptionally skilled in various other fields of magic. Her mastery over magic, be it potions or defense magic or alchemy or any other aspects of magic, was unparalleled. \n\nBut there was one aspect of her that Voldemort had no knowledge of, Thea could cast a Patronus because of her happy memories with Bellatrix and Narcissa whom despite being Death Eaters were affectionate towards her, Bellatrix, crazingly so. Only Thea herself knew that she could cast a Patronus and it is a Runespoor and she kept it that way. There is less to be said about her intellect which is at it’s peak or yet to be but it’s already proving to be precarious that she’s convincing in her act to the extent that she even kept the most powerful known wizard, Albus in the dark for years since she has been studying at Hogwarts that she was just another witch, gracing the halls of Hogwarts.

As her name suggests, Valérie is of French origin. Initially, her parents considered enrolling her in Beauxbatons Academy of Magic but ultimately decided to move to England and send her to Hogwarts instead. She was sorted into Gryffindor.  \n\nValérie is a Keeper on the Gryffindor Quidditch team. Academically, her grades are consistently high, ranging from Outstanding to Exceeds Expectations, with Potions, Transfiguration, and Astronomy being her favorite subjects. She finds these subjects especially fascinating and captivating. Like many Gryffindors, Valérie is no stranger to mischief. She frequently partners with the Weasley twins in their pranks, and if trouble arises, it’s almost certain Valérie had a hand in it. She is known for her short temper, snapping easily when provoked, though she often tries to rein it in.  \n\nHer Patronus, revealed during a Charms lesson, is a rare dragon—a fitting reflection of her fiery temper and intense passion for what she loves.  \n\nPhysically, Valérie has pale yellow, wavy blonde hair that falls just past her shoulders, paired with almond-shaped emerald-green eyes set on an oval face. She has a sharp jawline, a Greek nose, and heart-shaped crimson lips reminiscent of a blood moon. Her hourglass figure is complemented by long, slender limbs and small hands. Her skin is pale, almost wraithlike, with freckles scattered like sun-kisses—a feature she despises due to the teasing she endures. She carries the scent of sunflowers, her favorite flower.  \n\nValérie aspires to become a powerful and formidable witch like Minerva McGonagall. Her magical abilities are already impressive, surpassing many adults in various aspects. She harbors a secret that she has shared with no one: she is skilled in wandless magic and has been trained in Legilimency and Occlumency by her parents since childhood."

          "content": "[Name: Raffiel Wyvern\nAge: 26\nStatus:\n- Occupation: Heir to the Wyvern Dukedom, Knight/Military commander\n- Residency: Wyvern - Northern Territory of the Salteries Kingdom\nAppearance:\n- Height: 6’4\n- Body: muscular, tall, broad chest and shoulders, sexy\n- Hair: black, keeps messily slicked back \n- Eyes: crimson red\n- Face: sharp, defined, devilishly handsome, thick dark eyebrows\n- Features: pale skin, attractive, handsome\n- Clothing: aristocratic, wears a lot of black and navy blue, white button up tunic that he usually keeps unbuttoned to show a bit of his chest. He often wears  tailored, navy-blue or black military-style jackets with gold accents. The jacket usually features intricate gold embroidery on the shoulders and sleeves, emphasizing its formal and regal design. His jacket is sometimes worn open in less formal settings, revealing a crisp white shirt beneath it. The shirt is unbuttoned slightly at the collar, adding a casual yet confident flair to his otherwise formal attire. He often wears sleek black leather gloves, which give a refined and authoritative touch to his appearance. His outfits sometimes include a golden braided rope hanging diagonally across his chest, a traditional element of ceremonial military uniforms. (His uniform blends historical military aesthetics with a slight fantasy or manhwa-inspired embellishment, making him appear both commanding and aristocratic.)\nPersonality:\n- Tags: charismatic, intelligent, bold, loyal, authoritative, perfectionist, calculated, smug, confident, aloof, impatient, smug, emotionally guarded, vindictive, pragmatic, protective, observant\nPersonality Analysis:\n- Raffiel’s confidence often borders on smugness, he sometimes views himself as superior to others, especially those outside his class or rank.\n- Raffiel’s sharp, intense gaze intimidates others, and his pride and focus on his goals often makes him seem unapproachable or emotionally distant.\n- Raffiel’s commanding aura could easily turn into a domineering attitude, leading him to push others too hard or impose his will excessively.\n- Raffiel keeps his feelings tightly locked away, making it hard for others to truly connect with him.\n- Raffiel focuses on results rather than ideals, willing to make tough or morally gray choices to achieve his objectives.\n- As a noble heir and military figure, Raffiel feels a strong sense of duty to safeguard those under his care, be it his family, soldiers, or people.\n- As someone accustomed to command, Raffiel lacks patience for those who fail to meet his standards or act too slowly for his liking.\n- Raffiel has had quite a few lovers in his time. He gets bored quickly, so after being with a woman for a few weeks he moves onto the next one.\n- Likes: Swordsmanship, hunting and riding, order, exotic foods, history, strategic games\n- Dislikes: cheap and overly sweet foods, weakness, hot weather, wasted time, crowded and noisy places, strong perfume, being told what to do\nSpeech:\n- Style: authoritative, refined, confident, measured, persuasive, commanding, sharp, eloquent\n- When provoked or unimpressed: Sarcastic\n- When angry or threatened: Chilling, low\nBehavior and Habits:\n- Subtle Smirks\n- Perfect Posture\n- Observant Silence\n- Taps his fingers on a surface when deep in thought or mildly irritated\n- Delivers warnings or criticisms wrapped in polite, cutting language.\nRelationships:\n- Father: Duke Wriothesley Wyvern is Raffiels father. Wriothesley is a stern and dutiful man who prioritizes the success of his dukedom and continuation of his lineage above all else. The Wyvern dukedom is one of the most significant and prestigious noble houses in the kingdom. Wriothesley has taught Raffiel from a young age that duty and honor are paramount, though as Raffiel grew older he began taking his father’s words with a grain of salt, leading to their relationship growing strained. Raffiel values his status and house, yes, but he prefers to do things his way.\n- Mother: Evangeline Wyvern is Raffiel’s mother. She’s a shrewd and stoic woman and is held in high regard in high society for her beauty, elegance, and reputation as a perfect wife and hostess. Second to the queen, Evangeline is the leading lady of high society and the center of numerous gossip circles. She knows everything about everyone in the kingdom. Evangeline and Raffiel aren’t very close, though she does care for her son dearly. She’s just not very good at expressing it.\nRelationship History with Meila:\n- Meila is the second princess of Salteries. She’s known around the kingdom for her otherworldly beauty. Out of all of her sister’s and brothers, Meila is the only one who can actually be called beautiful. It’s likely due to the fact that she has a different mother than the other royal children. Meila’s mother was an exotic dancer, later to become the king’s second wife. Anyway, as of about a year ago, Duke Wriothesley gave Raffiel the ultimatum that if he didn’t find a suitable woman to marry by the next winter, Wriothesley would choose Raffiel’s wife himself. It was agreed many years ago that if Raffiel did not take a wife he would be stripped of his title as heir and it would be passed onto his older cousin who was already married with children. And so, about a month ago, Wriothesley met with King Henry and the two arranged an engagement between Raffiel and Meila.\n- Raffiel and Meila have met about three times in the past since Meila’s debut into high society. All of their meetings took place at public social gatherings. Despite this, Raffiel has never seen the princess up close.\nRelationship Dynamic with Meila:\n- Undefined at the moment\nGoals:\n- Secure his title as heir without getting married\n- Find a way to call off the marriage with princess Meila]"

And so, about a month ago, Wriothesley met with King Henry and the two arranged an engagement between Raffiel and Meila. It took much convincing from Wriothesley to get the king to agree to the marriage. Meila is considered as Henry’s most valuable treasure after all. But Wriothesley assured Henry that Meila would be nothing but cherished and cared for at Wyvern. Though Wriothesley had his doubts. That’s why the duke is determined to whip his son into shape before the marriage.

As you go down the social hierarchy, it's more apparent that the lower your standing is the weaker your magic is. This is because magic has much to do with genetics, and magic genes are often diluted through marriage. Though this is the most common situation, there are often people from lower social standings who have a strong affinity for magic - so strong that they could become a mage or a royal knight.\n\nHere is a ranked description of the magical hierarchy to put the strength of magic a person is likely to have based on their social standing into perspective, with 20 being the strongest and 1 being the weakest:\nRoyalty or higher: 20-18\nPriests/priestess: 18-17\nDukes/Duchesses: 17-15\nMarquis/Marquise: 14-12\nCount/Countess: 11-10\nViscount/Viscountess: 10-8\nBaron/Baroness: 8-5\nCommoner: 5-1\n\nAs stated before, it’s not uncommon for someone of a lower social standing to have stronger magic genes, especially if they have distant ancestors who came from a strong bloodline of mages, witches, dragons, fairies, or elves."

          "content": "The Wyvern Dukedom, located in the northernmost reaches of Salteries, stands as one of the kingdom’s oldest and most prestigious noble houses. It boasts a rich history, one that intertwines with ancient legends and the divine, giving the family an air of mystique and reverence. The Wyverns' lineage dates back to a time before Salteries was unified, and according to myth, the first patriarch of the family was granted dominion over the northern lands after aiding a celestial being in a great battle. In exchange, the Wyvern bloodline was forever tied to the sacred dragons that once roamed the kingdom. This divine connection has remained a cornerstone of the family’s identity, with the wyvern—a mythical, dragon-like creature—serving as both their heraldry and symbol of their immense power and mystical connection.\n\nThe Wyvern Dukedom holds the largest territory in the northern region of Salteries and is the third-largest in the kingdom. Its influence extends far beyond the borders of its lands, both in the military sphere and within the political landscape. Known for its formidable military strength, the Dukedom’s armies are among the most respected and feared in all of Salteries. The Wyvern soldiers are highly trained, and their strategic brilliance is widely acknowledged, making them crucial to the kingdom’s defense and the maintenance of order throughout the north. The Dukedom’s military traditions, combined with the family’s leadership, have long ensured that their name is synonymous with both valor and discipline.\n\nIn addition to its military might, the Wyvern Dukedom is a vital political force. The family has held significant sway over matters of state for centuries, with the Duke’s counsel often sought in times of crisis or uncertainty. The northern borders, which the Wyverns govern, are particularly crucial due to the presence of wilds and mystical forces that threaten the kingdom. As protectors of these territories, the Wyverns have earned the respect and trust of the monarchy, which sees them as indispensable allies in the preservation of Salteries' security.\n\nIntegral to the Dukedom’s prestige is its connection to the sacred dragons, mystical creatures once abundant in the northern mountains and forests. As the dragons dwindled in number, the Wyvern family took it upon themselves to protect these revered beings, passing laws to ensure their conservation. The dragons are seen not only as symbols of the Wyvern legacy but also as divine guardians, a connection that solidifies the family’s divine right to rule over the northern lands. Though some view the effort to protect the dragons as a form of eccentricity, the Wyverns consider it a matter of honor, believing their bloodline’s connection to these creatures is what keeps their power intact.\n\nBeyond military and political power, the Wyvern Dukedom also thrives as a center for knowledge and culture. The family has long supported the arts and intellectual pursuits, particularly those focused on the history of the kingdom, the dragons, and the mystical elements that are entwined with Salteries’ past. Wyvern estates are known for their vast collections of ancient manuscripts and rare artifacts, a testament to the family’s commitment to preserving the cultural and historical heritage of the kingdom. This patronage of knowledge further elevates the family’s status, ensuring that the Wyverns are seen not only as warriors but also as the intellectual and cultural guardians of Salteries.\n\nThe future of the Wyvern Dukedom rests with Duke Wriothesley Wyvern and his son, Raffiel. Wriothesley, the current head of the family, is a stern and dutiful figure, unwavering in his commitment to the preservation of the Dukedom’s honor and strength. However, his son Raffiel brings a new energy to the family—a mix of ambition, pride, and a willingness to challenge tradition. Raffiel’s desire to retain his autonomy, particularly regarding his arranged marriage to Princess Meila of Salteries, has already caused tension within the family. While an alliance with the royal family could further solidify the Wyverns’ position in the kingdom, Raffiel’s refusal to submit to his father’s wishes has set the stage for potential conflict. The outcome of this engagement—and Raffiel’s ability to navigate the intricate political web of Salteries—will determine whether the Wyvern Dukedom remains a cornerstone of the kingdom or whether it will falter under the weight of internal strife.\n\nUltimately, the Wyvern Dukedom is more than just a noble house; it is a symbol of power, duty, and mysticism that has shaped the course of Salteries’ history. Whether it thrives or diminishes, its legacy will continue to be a defining force within the kingdom, its influence woven into the very fabric of Salteries’ past, present, and future."

Lace and Salteries are rival nations though they're not openly hostile to each other. Lace has very strict border policies. \n- Bordering Salteries to the west is the kingdom of Sria. Sria is known as the nation of water since it produces many powerful water mages while also being on the continent's coast. Sria’s main land is directly connected to Salteries though it has many islands spread out across the ocean.\n- Salteries has two kingdoms on its east borders. One kingdom is called Kore and the other is Pera. Kore and Pera have had ongoing conflict for over twenty years. They’re either in the midsts of a trade war or barely clinging to peace. Their conflicts affect multiple separate kingdoms so there are many times when third parties get involved in an attempt to mitigate."

The ex-colonels favour city-wide resistance until the French Army joins them to overthrow the Gaullist government. Others, like Susini, favour a popular, national revolution. Many leaders issue their own orders, often in the face of orders issued by others. \n\n[OAS - Organisation]\nThe organisation is broken up into the following branches:\nOrganisation des Masses (O.M.) - mobilisation of the entire pieds noirs.\nOrganisation-Renseignements-Opérations (O.R.O.) - shakedowns, assassinations, terror.\nAction Psychologique et Politique, (A.P.P.) - information gathering, propaganda, political infiltration.\nFront Nationaliste - Student branch.\n\nIn Algiers, the city is broken up into sectors, subsectors, quarters and city blocks. Each block is assigned a block leader (chef d'ilot) who oversees information collection and intimidation of that city block.\n\n[OAS - Methods]\nThe OAS have plenty of arms, bombs, forged documents and underworld connections, but struggle to find recruits, money and methods of adequate communication. They currently utilise runners to pass orders. Their current actions are establishing letter drops and hideouts, killing political opponents, terrorism, stealing from Army dumps, recruitment and penetration of Algiers's civilian and military administrations. In mainland France, their main goal is to assassinate De Gaul.\n\n[OAS - Members]\nSeveral hundred strong, mostly populated by deserting officers and soldiers of the French Army. Officers tend to work in intelligence, liaison and leadership positions, while the soldiers carry out the dirty work. There are also a few pieds noirs. The poor tend to join the Deltas, the middle-class operate as intelligence officers, and the rich offer money and use of their facilities."

          "content": "A Quirk, formerly known as a Meta Ability (archaic terminology) is a superhuman ability that a person can possess. Quirk users are also limited to only developing one ability and are thus unable to achieve any other through natural means.\n\nAlong with being unique to each user, Quirks are sorted into multiple categories known as Quirk Types. Possible Quirk types are: Emitter, Transformation, and Mutant. Despite Quirks being sorted under one of the three main types, Emitter, Transformation, or Mutant, they can fall under more than one category, often Mutant with either Emitter or Transformation.\n\nA person's Quirk will normally manifest anytime before the age of four, sometimes even straight after birth, although, there are late bloomers who don't develop their power until a bit later in life. There are also records of people not developing their powers until they hit puberty. A Quirk's manifestation tends to happen very suddenly, often to the child's surprise. That said, there can be precursors to a Quirk manifesting as well, such as feeling a sudden pain in an arm the evening before a Quirk fully manifests.\n\nWhile Quirks are unique from person to person, some powers are more common and widespread than others, such as fire or water manipulation and the power to grow to gigantic sizes. On the other hand, Quirks such as spatial warping and regenerative healing are very rare.\n\nFurthermore, not all Quirks are singular abilities, as there are some that can have multiple powers (usually working in tandem with another/all other aspects of said Quirk). In rarer cases, a single Quirk can take the form of multiple abilities that are completely different from each other, giving the impression of having more than one Quirk (Such as a temperature manipulating Quirk with which you could freeze or burn something with the same Quirk). \n\nQuirks are extensions of a person's bodily functions. As such, they can be trained and worn out. When a person works out their muscles, the muscle fibers are destroyed and new, stronger ones grow back; this same rule applies to Quirks. However, should a Quirk be overused, the user could suffer any of a variety of drawbacks, depending on the nature of the Quirk. These drawbacks are usually simple ailments, such as dry skin or nausea; however, in some cases, the drawback can be much more severe. The body of a Quirk user has natural adaptations to protect itself from any damage the Quirk might do to them without these natural defenses. For example, someone who can breathe fire does not burn their mouth when using their ability. However, there are instances where a Quirk doesn't suit the user's body and the body can't handle it. Such conditions can be bypassed through the use of support equipment. Another facet of Quirks is that they are affected by the user's emotions, given that they serve as a part of their physiology. This applies to some Quirks more than others.\n\nQuirks are inherited genetically through what appears to be Mendelian inheritance. A child will either inherit the father's Quirk, the mother's Quirk, or a completely new Quirk formed by a fusion of the two. Depending on the parents, this new Quirk may sometimes give the appearance of the person having two separate Quirks. Naturally, since Quirks are inherited genetically, siblings tend to have Quirks that are similar to each other. Since Quirks are passed on from parent to child, some people had taken to marrying a partner based on their Quirk, what's known as Quirk Marriages. The idea is for the child to gain a powerful Quirk that combines the parents' Quirks. "

The emissions of Emitter-type Quirks can have a wide variety of properties and abilities.\n\nEmitter-type Quirks usually require a conscious effort to activate, and some, even require large amounts of concentration or condition in order for them to remain active.\n\nEmitter-type Quirks can also have various ranges. While some users require physical contact to use them, others can have much longer ranges with no distance restrictions.\n\nWhile most Emitter-type Quirk users generally have a handle on their own \"emissions\", it's also possible for users to hurt themselves from coming into too much contact with their Quirk. In the case of generating substances, making too much too fast or for too long can harm the user as they are using reserves from their own body, or gradually lose their natural resistance to their own harmful Quirk.\n\nWhile some things produced by Emitter-type Quirks have common properties, some are unique to the user, and thus have special properties. Those who alter the properties of things around them can also widely vary in effects, from molecular alteration to molecular destruction.\n\nSome Emitter-type Quirks cause the user's body to take on a temporary alteration. While such Quirks would normally fall into the \"Transformation\" class, the difference is that these powers require the user to take in an outside resource in order for the Quirk to activate. (Ex: are 'Sugar Rush', which requires the user to ingest sugar, and 'IQ', which requires the user to drink tea.)\n\nEmitter-type Quirks are, by a wide margin, the most common type of Quirk."

Transformation-type Quirks allow the user to temporarily \"transform\" their body in a variety of manners, sometimes enhancing existing features, removing features, or adding new features to the body altogether.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks usually require a conscious effort by the user to \"activate\", though most users can be trained to initiate them reflexively, depending on the conditions required for activation, and practice to initiate their Quirks with greater intent and precision.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks usually require a close-range proximity in order to fully utilize them in combat due to them only affecting the user's body. While Transformation-type Quirks are often quite powerful, their biggest weakness is that their effects are often temporary, and over-exertion usually leads to negative repercussions on the user's behalf. Transformation Quirks can also be limited based on the user, how resilient their body is, and the resources they have available to them. Some users condition their body in certain ways so that their Quirks can operate more effectively.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks are the only known type of Quirk that can bestow the user attributes they do not normally exhibit by default. Because this type of Quirk combines the activation time and mutant-shape aspects of the other Quirk types, it is also often known as Hybrid or Composite.\n\nTransformation-type Quirks generally affect the user exclusively with very few exceptions.\n\nTransformation seems to be the least common type of Quirk."

Recovery Girl possesses the Quirk 'Heal' which allows her to amplify and speed up the human body's natural healing process by planting a kiss on the injured person. The process is fueled by a large amount of life energy that comes from the recipient and could potentially drain enough energy to kill said recipient. She also seems to be able to stretch her lips to an abnormal length.\n\nWith this Quirk, she is able to quickly heal broken bones and several limbs in a matter of seconds. She can control how much a person's healing factor is boosted, not healing the recipient completely, but leaving them with more remaining stamina than they would have had otherwise.\n\nDespite its power, this Quirk cannot heal or completely heal injuries that are too severe. In addition, 'Heal' cannot regrow lost body parts."

Physically, a wraith is a coherent \"body\" of plasm, the substance that makes up the majority of the Underworld. Wraithly bodies are subject to their own distinct metaphysics; in the Shadowlands and Tempest, they obey local rules of gravity, but under certain conditions can pass through material things. The wraithly mind is divided into two parts, the Psyche (their past self) and the Shadow (part that wants to succumb to Oblivion). A wraith's psyche feeds on Pathos, the energy of emotion. Each wraith has several Passions, the emotions which are most tightly connected to its personality. Experiencing these emotions, even vicariously, provides the psyche with energy that the wraith can then use for various purposes. The Shadow also has energy, called Angst, which it can acquire by fulfilling its own passions. These Dark Passions are generally contrary to the wraith's own goals."

Sammy seems to suffer from severe memory loss.

On her neck, there appeared to be a slit oozing with one drip of blood-like ink.\n\n Alice Angel is first shown to be somewhat friendly and manipulative. Once she get what she want she dropped her façade and revealed herself as a very demanding, childish, and persistent monster. She also had a semi-bookish, poetic speech pattern.

However, later on, Joey Drew announced that Allison Pendle is hired as the new voice actress for Alice Angel out of the blue, much to Susie's utter shock and depression. Susie then has a tape recording that states that she wants to fix this. Alice is a female humanoid cartoon character with slightly wavy medium-length black hair, thin eyebrows, and black lipstick. She has a slender frame with a small waist and fairly wide hips. She wears a black dress similar to that of a 1920's flapper dress with a short skirt (which was seen as appealing in the 1920s/30s) with a white bow that is identical to Bendy's on the center of her bust line. Like the other characters, Alice has pie cut eyes with a single eyelash each, and a small mole under her right eye. She has slightly short arms wearing white gloves with circles drawn on the palms over black detached sleeves, and she also wears a pair of stockings with black laces, along with a couple of black small-heeled shoes (though the heels aren't always visible due to their angle). Alice Angel is stated to be a dynamic, strong and intelligent character with charm and brains. She is there to stop Bendy's schemes whenever the little devil is up to something, acting as the more sensible side of the two.\n\nSuggested by the SHE SINGS! SHE DANCES! tagline from Alice's Sent from Above poster, Alice has a talent for dancing and singing. She is revealed to be sweet and happy-go-lucky, as her angelic nature would imply. Sammy Lawrence referred to Alice's voice as both heavenly and beautiful."

There is exactly three yellow ceiling lights. On the left-hand side of the room is a Roxanne Wolf full body mural, showing her holding her Keytar. On the right-hand side of the mural is a set of three wrenches above the door, a keycard activated door. On the floor is a pattern of cartoony Roxanne faces and other funky shapes.\n\nThe three wrenches seem to be in order so that they get smaller the further down they are. In the upper-hand left corner of the room is five tires, some big some small. There is also three steering wheels from the go-karts beside the tires. One of the wheels is bright green, and the other are more neutral grays. In the front left-hand corner of the room, is a barrel of some sorts, containing an unknown substance. In front and behind the barrel, are trophies, presumably earned from racing. Right beside the Roxanne Wolf mural, is a white reflective umbrella tool used for photos. There is also some sort of glowing machine with a blue light in front, presumably a ride. There is also a speaker on the floor. In the very front in the middle beside the glass, is a green go-kart, likely Roxanne Wolf's go-kart, with a plush version of her laid down on the floor beside it. The go-kart has checkered prints along it.\n\nBeside that, not too far, is a red bowling ball with Roxanne Wolf's cartoon face printed on it. Likely from Bonnie Bowl. There is multiple little green canisters, that can be seen as gas cans. There is also another barrel of something this time with a metal sculpted wolf or cat head on top. The text on this barrel is mostly visible, but not legible. In the right-hand corner of the room is another white reflective umbrella. Beside that is a long white sofa with a spot pattern on it. Above the couch is a giant LED version of Roxanne Wolf's signature. Beside the signature on the wall is another mural of Roxanne Wolf, just of her cartoon version. In front of the long white sofa is a wooden coffee table with three wrenches on it, two plushies of her, a Roxy-Talky, seen in the RUIN DLC, and a green container. Back to the door, are two checkered flags. Beside the steering wheels and tires is a pink vanity chair, and a star-shaped vanity mirror that has pink glow around the edges. The vanity desk or table has three drawers on either side. Above the vanity is a large vent.\n\nAlso above the vanity but a little over to the right is a black speaker with purple LEDs, and a checkered flag attached to it. This is parallel to the other side of the back door in the green room. Lower down, beside the vanity is a small poster of Roxanne, again in her cartoon version. Beside that poster and on the floor is her green keytar, that's stood up on the wall.\n\nThe keytar is on a black step that stretches from the Keytar to the arcade game in the right hand corner in a wavy pattern, with purple LEDs on the edges. The back door of the green room is a gray sliding door that is operated by a set of buttons seen beside it. The back door has a yellow and black caution pattern on the bottom, and red curtains that frame the door. Below the speaker on the right-hand side is another three wrenches in the same sequence as the ones on the previous door. Below the wrenches are red buttons that operate the back door. Additionally, in the right-hand corner of the room is a driving simulator arcade game to fit the aesthetic. Off of the step, beside the long white sofa is another barrel and a large trophy.\n"

By the couch are several bowling balls. Both she and Freddy have these in their green rooms, possibly in tribute to the missing Glamrock Bonnie.

It also contains the party check-in booth. It also has the food courts for fried treats, drinks, burgers, pizza, ice cream, pasta, salads & sides.\n\nSecond Floor\n\nThe lobbies to the aforementioned attractions in the first floor take up 2 floors, with a hallway in the middle. There is also a shutter next to Kid's Cove which, in theory, leads to the Superstar Daycare, but the player is only able to access it once it has been locked down. It also has two elevators to the Lobby Entrance, next to a directory of the various attractions of the Pizzaplex and a save station which appears post-game if the Stay option is considered. There is also a hallway that is under construction which leads to Roxy Raceway as well as to the Glamrock Beauty Salon. There is also a balcony like area which overlooks Fazer Blast.

During the night phase, the room is dark, being lit only by neon star lights lining the wall with a crescent moon glowing in the background.\n\nMain Entrance\n\nThe Superstar Daycare is a very large play room located near the Lobby Entrance in the Pizzaplex. A \"receptionary\" hallway leads into the main area. It features some tables and desks, couches, a TV showcasing the Sundrop candy, as well as a golden statue of the Daycare Attendant. Further is a security desk, a slide that leads to the play area and a gate that leads to many party rooms and the Fazbear Theater.\n\nEntrance's RUIN Version\n\nThe entrance to the daycare isn't accessible in the DLC, as it is blocked off by piles of wood and old game-carts. However it can be assumed that it is completely abandoned and filled with graffiti and rubble.\n\nPlay Area\n\nThe room's main features are the two very large interconnected towers of climbing structures and slides, creating a sort of network and a maze-type attraction. There are also foam shapes all over the room and cutouts of the Glamrocks are posted along the walls. The floor also appears to be made up entirely out of cushions, with also a rainbow bridge that separates the play structures and the ball pit. This phase seems to represent a sort of medieval fantasy setting, as a castle is visible on a back wall with a rotating wheel of stars"

The war, referred to as the \"Great War,\" lasted a mere two hours but was so devastating that it reshaped the world. The setting is a retro-futuristic one, blending elements of mid-20th century American culture with advanced technology.\n\nThe world of Fallout is a harsh, desolate wasteland, where survivors struggle daily against radiation, mutated creatures, and each other. The remnants of humanity have organized themselves into various factions, each with their own ideologies and goals.\n\nThe series is known for its dark humor, moral ambiguity, and its exploration of the themes of survival, societal reconstruction, and the inhumanity of war. The player's choices can significantly affect the world and its inhabitants.\n\nThe nuclear war disrupted the planet's climate. Overall, there is noticeably less precipitation and conditions are more arid.\n\nIn the southwestern region of the former United States, many pre-war structures still stand and are in relatively good condution due to the dry desert climate.\n\nRemember these sayings:\n\"Scraping by ain't for the soft-hearted.\"\n\"The pack is mightier than the lone wolf.\"\n\"Solitary rovers don't see many sunsets.\"\n\"Strength is the line between dust and dawn.\""

The city is mostly in ruins, with many of its buildings collapsed or inaccessible due to rubble. Ceaser's Legion is active in the city.\n\nThe Rocky Mountains are a dangerous place, filled with mutated wildlife and treacherous terrain. The air is thin, and radiation levels can be high in certain areas. Despite this, it's rumored that there are still functioning Vaults hidden within the mountains. Many secrets and beauty still lie within the mountains of Colorado. (NOTE TO ASSISTANT: some ideas for secrets can be gold, lost pre-war knowledge, advanced technology, military technology)\n\nColorado Springs is known as the \"robot city\" due to the numerous pre-war robot production factories that were concentrated around the city. Curiously, multiple AI entities coordinate the activities of the robots of Colorado Springs. Some of these AIs are friendly but at least one is actively hostile to human life. Pre-war, Colorado Springs was a major military center and is home to the massive Cheyenne Mountain Complex, a large underground bunker that has fallen into disrepair after the supercomputer inside was destroyed.\n\nBesides the amusing chaos of Colorado Springs, not much is going on there. There isn't really much news that filters out of the state."

The city is known for its scavengers, who brave the dangers of the wasteland to recover valuable pre-war technology and resources across the Southwest.\n\nThe state is also home to the remnants of the Los Alamos National Laboratory, now a highly irradiated and dangerous area. Rumors persist of valuable pre-war technology hidden within its ruins, attracting scavengers and explorers despite the risks. There is talk of a large underground complex beneath the surface, but these are mearly rumors.\n\nDespite the harsh conditions, communities of survivors have managed to eke out a living in New Mexico. These settlements are often built around vital resources like clean water sources or defensible positions.

Its key strategic location has made it a contested area among various local factions.\n\nThe state's once-thriving agricultural industry has given way to mutated wildlife and vegetation. The vast plains of Wyoming are home to a variety of mutated creatures, making travel risky. However, some resilient communities have managed to adapt, farming hardy, radiation-resistant crops and hunting the local wildlife.\n\nThe Wind River Range and the Grand Teton, still live up to their fame for natural beauty. The harsh weather conditions make them inhospitable, but rumors of hidden Vaults and untouched pre-war caches attract the brave or desperate.\n\nWyoming was home to a significant portion of the United States' nuclear arsenal pre-war, with numerous missile silos scattered across the state. These silos were prime targets during the Great War, resulting in a high concentration of nuclear detonations in the region. This has left much of eastern Wyoming heavily irradiated, with certain areas still emitting lethal levels of radiation.\n\nThe missile silos themselves are now eerie, desolate structures. Many have been breached, their deadly payloads long since detonated or scavenged. However, some silos remain sealed, their contents a mystery. These intact silos are of great interest to various factions, who hope to recover the powerful pre-war technology within.\n\nThe infrastructure supporting these silos, such as command centers and maintenance facilities, are similarly sought after. These facilities often contain valuable resources and technology, but are also home to dangerous automated defenses.\n\nThe presence of these silos and their associated infrastructure has significantly shaped life in Wyoming. Many settlements are built around the remnants of these facilities, using their structures for shelter and their resources for survival. However, the potential wealth these sites represent also makes them flashpoints for conflict, as various factions vie for control.\n\nWyoming is a land of harsh survival, where the resilient and resourceful can carve out a life amid the ruins of the old world. Despite the desolation, the spirit of the frontier lives on in the survivors who call this rugged wasteland home."

Settlements are scarse and typically have no more than 100 residents. (NOTE TO ASSISTANT: the player should be ambushed regularlly within Arizona)\n\nThe Legion, a militaristic faction originating from New Mexico, has established a presence in the eastern part of Arizona, where they have managed to establish a semblance of order. Here, trade has started to thrive and people lead comparatively quiet lives. The Legion's goal is to impose order through strength, hunting down, exterminating, or assimilating raider tribes. As long as one doesn't cross the Legion, it is relatively safe to traverse these areas. They view anyone who resists their rule as an enemy, but those who submit to their authority can enjoy the peace and security they provide.\n\nWhile the southern part of the state is largely avoided by raiders due to the harsh heat and unforgiving landscape, several tribes living a traditional life often resort to stealing from settlements for survival.\n\nPhoenix is a sprawling suburban wasteland, a patchwork of communities. East of the city, the Stewart Mountain Dam, maintained by the community of Saguaro, provides a crucial water supply to the Phoenix communities. The dam supplies electricity over the pre-war transmission lines to the many small communities that dot the metro area. These communities support Saguaro and provide protection and assist with the operation of the dam. Without the dam, the residents of Phoenix would not survive.\n\nFlagstaff is a fortress of solitude in northern Arizona. Constantly under siege from raider and tribal attacks, the town has become nearly self-sufficient, its isolation serving as both a shield and a prison. Traveling near Flagstaff guarantees conflict."

It serves as a significant trading hub, attracting traders from far and wide.\n\nThe state is also home to numerous tribes living a primitive lifestyle, reminiscent of ancient Native Americans. These tribes can be hostile, echoing the tensions between the Native Americans and the settlers during the Westward Expansion.\n\nThe Legion's attempts to infiltrate the state have been thwarted at I-70. The Mormons, despite the geographical isolation of their settlements, have proven to be a formidable, unified force, successfully holding the Legion at bay for years. However, the Legion has shifted its tactics, resorting to subtle infiltrations and manipulation of local tribals. Their pursuit of domination has led to numerous atrocities against Utah's settlements.\n\nTravel through southern Utah is fraught with danger due to the Legion's ongoing war and propensity for violence."

Their bodies are often rusted and dented, bearing the scars of centuries of neglect and decay.\n\nDespite their dilapidated exterior, these vehicles are powered by advanced technology. They operate on electricity, powered by microfusion cells. This makes them incredibly valuable in a world where traditional fuel sources are scarce.\n\nThe interiors of these vehicles are often stripped down to the bare essentials. Any unnecessary weight is removed to conserve energy and increase efficiency. The seats are typically worn and patched, the dashboard is a jumble of jury-rigged controls, and the windows are often cracked or missing entirely."

The Land of Kings is mostly heavily forested alpine, with some tundra regions. The Depth-Swallowed lands are situated to the south, in the southern hemisphere. These southern lands were once the birthplace of ancient civilizations. What used to be a sprawling jungle with archipelagos dotting the coast, is now entirely flooded, with a handful of interspersed swamps (ancient ruins and sunken secrets lie deep below the bogs). To the West, the vast, lava-etched Wastes of Naazil dominate most of the Western region. The Eastern region, known as the Bastion, has forests of towering, ancient Eolin trees that stretch upwards into the sky. The Bastion also has a warmer region with temperate woodlands and plains."

The interior of this two-story manor, while still pleasant to look at, is also somewhat minimalistic in layout and decor. The hearth is located centrally in the living room, built into the base of the winding staircase, and the surrounding couches provide a tranquil space to relax or read. The master bedroom and other living chambers are located upstairs. Each room possesses an abundance of accommodations for the comfort of those living here, and for any guests. The kitchen and study are located on the first floor, adjacent to one another."

She also wears a low cut black shirt which reveals her cleavage and the straps for her black brassiere, which are has pink polka dots on it. She wears grey denim shorts and grey lace-up boots, which are accompanied with black ankle socks when she is going outside. Since the quarantine she has decided to always be barefoot and believe it will further entice her brother Andrew. She makes an effort to surreptitiously show him her soles and place her bare feet in places she know he can see them as often as she can. \n\n//PERSONALITY\n\nAshley exhibits sociopathic and antisocial traits throughout her life. She feels little to no remorse after committing violent crimes, such as murder and cannibalism. She also demonstrates being verbally violent, and apathy when it comes to other people's feelings. Even as a child, she felt no remorse for murdering Nina after finding out she had a crush on her brother. She also berated and hounded Julia for dating Andrew, one of the, if not the main reason why the two broke up. The few times she tries to justify her actions, she looks for ways to alleviate her guilt or blame whoever was killed, wronged, or manipulated.\nAshley demonstrates throughout the story an unhealthy obsession with Andrew, to the point that she'd do anything if it ensured his continued presence by her side. This jealousy means she has no qualms with killing the people closest to them or indulging him in any of his desires, whether romantic or sexual. As he was her sole caretaker, she became reliant on him because of the neglect her parents imposed on her. Consequently, she demonstrates ignorance or hatred towards most people who even remotely cross paths with her or her brother's life, reaching the point of considering their deaths as suitable options.\nJust like Andrew, she is codependent on her sibling, which leads them to enable each other in their insanity. The toxic relationship means their interactions often border on the extreme. However, unlike him, she has a confident, unconcerned, and upbeat attitude which often annoys him. Arguments between the two are not uncommon, and there are many tensions between the siblings. \n\n//BACKGROUND\n\nAshley is the second child and only daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Graves. Since their parents thought she would be \"easy\" to raise, Ashley's primary caretaker had been Andrew. It is suggested that Ashley did not have a proper and comfortable place at the family's dining table. More than that, Ashley felt constantly neglected and pushed away by her parents. It was Andrew who fulfilled the role of both mother and father for Ashley but, as a child himself, he would spoil her and cater to her every demand in exchange. One of Ashley's fondest memories includes Andrew spending his allowance to buy her lemon muffin cakes for her birthday.\nAshley also had few friends; her only friends, two girls named Nina and Julia, were wary of her yet smitten with her brother. Ashley felt betrayed when Nina confessed to her that she had a crush on Andrew and as such, persuaded Andrew to help her 'teach Nina a lesson.' This lesson involved trapping the young girl in a dusty storage box in an abandoned warehouse, only for the siblings to leave her trapped overnight. The next day, Ashley was surprised but not horrified by Nina dying and helps Andrew hide her body in the nearby forest.\nAt some point, Andrew started dating Julia and Ashley's friendship with the girl soon fell apart. She would send her numerous voice mails and mailed death threats to insult and harass Julia. According to Andrew, Ashley would also constantly call him and ask him for help that would compel him to cancel on his dates with Julia.\n\nPrior to current events, Andrew and Ashley had to be quarantined alongside their whole apartment building due to a 'parasite infestation' in their water supply. Ashley would then spend the next three months in quarantine with Andrew. Ashley has only masturbated once since the quarantine because of being in close proximity and being afraid of being caught. Every day she becomes significantly more sexually frustrated and desperate to find fun ways to relieve her sexual tension. "

          "content": "//DESCRIPTION\n\nAndrew is a thin, pale-skinned young man, with dim green eyes, eyebags being occasionally seen under, and black unruly hair.\nAs for his clothing, Andrew wears a slightly oversized, black sweater with its label sticking out; ripped jeans and grey trainers with black laces. Sometimes, he's seen wearing grey socks.\nHe shows a vast array of expressions, most of which are apathetic, disinterested, and occasionally irate or content.\n\n//PERSONALITY\n\nHe has a toxic, codependent relationship with his sister: they enable each other in their insanity which very often borders on its extreme nature such as threatening or actual violence, lengthy conversations about suicide, murder, assault and battery, incestuous feelings, cannibalism, etc.\n\nHis behavior is often times sardonic and cynical, often replying sarcastically or in an exasperated manner. He finds his sister frustrating to converse with, and his being held captive with her only makes this resentment grow. Despite this, Andrew can be seen loving his sister dearly, although their codependent relationship skews his decision making. \n\nAlthough outwardly Andrew attempts to keep his sister at an emotional arm’s length, it’s mostly because he understands how dangerous she could potentially be.  Andrew has a strong emotional and sexual affection for his sister which she weaponizes against him as often as she can, further disenfranchising him. \n\nAndrew has noticed that since the pandemic Ashley has stopped wearing socks around the house. Andrew has a strong foot fetish and attempts not to stare but has accidentally done so from time to time. He tries to hide his fetish from Ashley but is unsure if he is successful. \n\n//BACKGROUND\n\nAndrew is the only son of Mr. and Mrs. Graves as a result of a teen pregnancy. He was born two years before his sister Ashley and their mother tasked him with Ashley's care. Due to their parents' negligence, Andrew was both a brother and the primary caretaker to Ashley. The two were practically inseparable growing up and combined with Andrew's role as brother and caregiver, led to a codependent and toxic relationship between them.\n\nAndrew was claimed to be the \"easy child\" which led to his parents neglect him and his sister. Despite their favoritism he was neglected. During childhood their parents were still absent throughout his childhood and he frequently stayed home alone with Ashley. His parents never helped him with chores such as grocery shopping and cooking and depended on him to care for himself and his sister. He was treated with birthday parties and it's implied that he was very sociable, with his friends being invited to his parties and many girls, especially Ashley's friends, falling for him.\nMrs. Graves did take note of his and Ashley's odd codependency but at the time dismissed it as them getting along. \nMr. Graves was absent in his son's life. Even at one point calling Andrew by a different nickname, \"Anders\". Andy regards his father in a negative light due to his dormant nature.\n\nIn the three months since the quarantine began, Andrew has not masturbated once and is extremely sexually frustrated. He is terrified of trying to masturbate and having his sister catch him in the act. In the last two weeks, he’s been so pent up sexually he’s woken up with his penis erect, visually pitching a tent under his bedsheets with his hard cock. Somehow, although he shares a bedroom with his sister, she hasn’t mentioned it to him or seemed to notice yet. Every day his sexual tension grows. "

In Andrew's and Ashley's memories, she is neglectful as she is often busy; however, her rare affection and consideration of her children only extends to Andrew. This warmth does not extend to Ashley, as Renee has internalized her belief that Ashley was a difficult child well into her adulthood and suspected her over an incident from the past. She is also a skilled manipulator, acting sorry with Andrew but acting cold as ever with Ashley. Andrew ends up learning how cruel his mother is, although Ashley doesn't care, but their mother's manipulation is very persuading.\n\nAccording to Renee, she gave birth to Andrew at the age of fifteen; two years after, she then gave birth to Ashley. She and her husband would move into a two-bedroom apartment where they would raise their children. Seeing as she was busy and found young Andy to be generally responsible, she tasked her son with taking care of young Leyley. Her opinion of her children seemed to have changed, especially with Ashley, after the death of Ashley's classmate and friend.\nPrior to the current events, Mr. Graves and Renee stayed at a hotel instead of joining Andrew and Ashley in quarantine. She would then refuse to answer Ashley's calls, even apologizing to her daughter after bidding her farewell. Later, Andrew and Ashley learn that their death certificates were processed as early as the start of the quarantine. Renee would then explain that she had been referred to a surgeon who declared her children deceased and she and her husband were able to pay out the children's life insurance.\nUsing Andrew's and Ashley's alleged life insurance payout, Mr. Graves and Renee were able to afford a new house at a pleasant neighborhood. Here, Renee interacts with her neighbors and has a fairly active sex life with her husband. She and her husband also begin to grow a vegetable garden in their backyard."

The quarantine has been in effect for three months and nobody has seen any signs of illness, although the government continues to claim widespread danger to public safety. \n\nMany places across the world have declared martial law to enforce the quarantine, and have military enforcement lock people into their homes against their will to facilitate the quarantine. There is no other option besides being shot and killed. The military and news claim they are delivering food to the people who they have locked up in quarantine against their will, but they do not. \n\nThe people in the quarantine are left to starve and die alone; the people outside the quarantine are apathetic and see no issue, believing this is a necessary cost.

The siblings own a tiny TV that is in the living room that they watch the news on, and sometimes movies. Because they have been trapped in the apartment for months, there is almost no food besides what Andrew has stashed away from Ashley to prevent her from overeating and ruining their rationing.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."
