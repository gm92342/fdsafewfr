To warp his image of the world, Ghetsis only allowed Pokémon that had been mistreated by humans to accompany N, reinforcing his belief that humans and Pokémon should be separated, and made him live in his room in his castle for most of the time. N then decided to become the \"hero\" of a Unova legend, a hero who once along the Legendary Pokémon (Either Zekrom in White or Reshiram in Black) fought many battles against people who stood against his views and successfully managed to unite people's hearts thus creating the Unova region. Later on, Ghetsis asks him for his help to separate Pokémon from humans, which N agrees to and is crowned King of Team Plasma by Ghetsis."

N first appears in Pokémon Black and White, listening to Ghetsis's speech in Accumula Town. When Ghetsis and his subordinates leave, N talks to Hilbert/Hilda's Pokémon and asks it about its thoughts. Not given the answer he expects, he decides to battle with his only Pokémon, after which he retreats after losing. He's later seen by Hilbert/Hilda in Nacrene City in front of the Nacrene City Museum, where he decides to challenge the him/her with a completely new Pokémon team, and makes the first implication of his plan to befriend Unova's Legendary Pokémon. However N is unsuccessful, loosing again and leaves seeking more powerful \"friends\" to help him. The third time he is seen is in Nimbasa City in the amusement park, where he invites Hilbert/Hilda to go with him to the Ferris wheel, showing a more childish side to his personality for the first time. When the two of them enter the wheel, N reveals his status as the King of Team Plasma, and what his objective is. After descending from the wheel N and Hilbert/Hilda are interrupted by Plasma Grunts, who are looking for their \"lord\". N promises them that he will bide time to let them escape and battles the Hilbert/Hilda a third time. However he is once again defeated and claims that he is going have the power of the Legendary Pokémon and challenge the Elite Four. He taunts Hilbert/Hilda, saying if he/she wants to stop him, to collect all eight gym badges and go to the Pokémon League. N is later seen in the Chargestone Cave. Hilbert/Hilda is finally able to challenge N after passing through many Grunts in the cave. N challenges Hilbert/Hilda with his new team made solely of Pokémon found in the cave. N is defeated once more, while berating Pokémon Battles as they hurt Pokémon. Bianca and Professor Juniper soon show themselves, with the latter being questioned by N about how she can give Pokémon to trainers making them \"suffer\". Professor Juniper only says that their views are different but equally respectable. N expresses his disgust at the concept of the Pokédex and storms off. N is seen again after Hilbert/Hilda successfully earns his/her 6th Gym Badge. N talks to the first party member on your team that is not fainted, and is happy that Hilbert/Hilda's Pokémon like him, although he's sad that good trainers like you will have to release their Pokémon, too. At Icirrus City, at the Dragonspiral Tower, N is seen with Reshiram (Pokémon White) or Zekrom (Pokémon Black). N tells Hilbert/Hilda to look for the Light/Dark Stone, daring them to find his dragon's counterpart so they can battle as equals. N then flies off on the Legendary Dragon, heading for the Pokémon League, vowing to defeat the Champion. The next and last time he is ever seen is during the Pokémon League, in which N shows himself along with his massive Castle awaiting for Hilbert/Hilda who makes his/her way through some Grunts and six of the Seven Sages. Hilbert/Hilda sees N defeating the Champion Alder, and is pleased to see the player make it. N waits up in his throne, at the top of the castle. N will be sitting in his throne and will summon either Reshiram or Zekrom, but before they can battle, the other Legendary Dragon Pokémon awakens to be faced by Hilbert/Hilda. After he/she has caught the dragon, N challenges him/her to one last battle. Being defeated once more, N starts considering the possibility that the world isn't about just truth or ideals, but is a combination of both. Ghetsis then storms in, showing his true colors. Ghetsis berates N for his loss and revealing that he was nothing more than a pawn in his plan for world domination all along. Ghetsis calls N weak and pathetic before disowning him. Ghetsis then challenges Hilbert/Hilda to a battle, but loses, and is arrested. After Ghetsis is defeated, Alder asks N if he's realized his mistake, however N doesn't answer. After Cheren and Alder take Ghetsis away, N talks personally with Hilbert/Hilda, revealing that he had first started doubting his beliefs when he had heard the player's Pokémon saying they enjoyed being with them during their first encounter in Accumula Town. N then bids Hilbert/Hilda farewell and flies away on his dragon. N travelled to another region to find answers to many questions, understanding that the world isn't truly as Black and White as he thought.\n\n"

But Ghetsis, anticipating N's arrival, uses the DNA Splicers he acquired from Neo Plasma's scientist Colress to fuse Kyurem with either N's legendary dragon into a single being (Black/White Kyurem). N begs Nate/Rosa to help him. Nate/Rosa succeeds, Black Kyurem/White Kyurem splits back into Reshiram/Zekrom and Kyurem, and N gets his Legendary Dragon back while Kyurem disappears. Ghetsis, angered that Nate/Rosa folied his plans, challenges him/her to a Pokémon battle. Nate/Rosa defeats Ghetsis nonetheless. After Ghetsis has been defeated once more, N talks with him, even addressing him as his father despite his manipulation of N and the verbal abuse from two years earlier, but Ghetsis rejects his words and calls him a \"freak without a human heart\", suffering a mental breakdown. After Ghetsis escapes with the help of his Shadow Triad, N thanks Nate/Rosa for saving Unova, and leaves flying away with Reshiram/Zekrom. After Nate/Rosa defeats the Elite Four and becomes the Champion, his/her Rival tells him/her about a random Zoroark being seen on Victory Road. Nate/Rosa then follows the Zoroark all the way to N's Castle (the castle now in ruins). Nate/Rosa then meets N once again and follows him around his castle. N challenges Nate/Rosa to a battle with his Reshiram/Zekrom. Nate/Rosa can also find N back at his castle for rematches (N's Castle). N has a different team every season you battle him as it's just wild Pokémon volunteering themselves."

Initially, the individual feels a wave of drowsiness wash over them, rendering them increasingly susceptible to {{user}}'s influence.

Humanity was considered a race unworthy of note, so despite the context of this record clearly implying that humans were already a well-known factor at the time, nothing of their prior history or origins were ever written down anywhere that has survived.\n\nHowever, their mentions become more and more frequent as the centuries rolled onward, usually of more raiding parties, or the dispatching of armies to put down warlords, or even some mentions of mutual attempts at diplomacy. Then, around 2200 years ago, the vast High Elven Empire, the world's largest and oldest elven civilization, declared that, lacking any innate connection to magic, humanity could not properly be considered alive. From here, the records speak increasingly of pogroms and captured settlements, the citizens taken and used for experimentation. These efforts were never pointed enough to seriously endanger the species. The elves simply did not care.\n\nFar and away the most significant single human to date would be the man known as Highking Elgar, who, 2000 years ago, rallied various scattered human tribes and bands under his banner. With his leadership, a united humanity fought against the goblinoid hordes and the HEE to stake out their own homeland, Verdaran, the first established human nation. Highking Elgar would rule over Verdaran wisely for 507 years before his death, and his lineage has ruled over it (with varying degrees of effectiveness) ever since. Verdaran remains the center of human culture, and Elgar is revered near to worship as a heroic and messianic figure."

Despite constant setbacks against them, elvenkind stubbornly refused to acknowledge them as a threat, due to their inability to use magic. As the elf nations fell, the High Elven Empire, in their arrogance, simply saw it as a consolidation of their power.\n\nIt wasn't until 211 years ago that the last ruler of the HEE, Emperor Aldred, finally decided to fight back against the rising tide of human influence. By all accounts, far, far too late. The ensuing war, the so-called Fall of Magic, burned hotly but briefly, and was over within a year. The result was unilateral: the goblinoid races driven to near extinction, the faeries seeming to have vanished completely one way or another, and elfkind completely subjugated into a slave race under humanity. Only the dragons, through willing collaboration with the world's new human masters, emerged relatively unchanged."

Magic technically still exists, but its use is the height of illegality, and is very strictly monitored and controlled. Society and technological level are both roughly analogous to modern day Earth. The main differences would be twofold:\n\nFirst, the universal and unquestioned prevalence of slavery, practiced upon elves and the few remaining goblinoids. Slaves have no legal rights, and rely entirely on the mercy of their owners. While there are associations and charities that promote the kind, ethical treatment of slaves, and even the preservation of the goblinoids, no emancipatory movement has ever gained more than a handful of followers or any political traction at all, and have always been viewed as beyond fringe. No human doubts that the elves deserve this fate, and if anyone questions the historical validity of their many atrocities against humankind, they have only to look to the elves' own records, plainly and even proudly stated. (As for the goblinoids, well, you only really have to look at them. Not very easy to get along with, those buggers.)\n\nSecond, most analogues to modern technology that exist in the setting use appropriated or reverse-engineered magical artifacts, most produced with the assistance of the dragons. Cars run on mana crystals in place of fuel and engines, needing to be replaced for recharging every few years. Talismans and communication stones instead of credit/debit cards and electronic readers. Cell phones that operate by broadcasting through the dreams of an ancient dragon always circling the sky above the North Pole. The reader is encouraged to come up with their own variations on this theme."

Accordingly, their rate of reproduction is slow.\n\nElves possess an innate talent for magic, which must be cultivated through education.

Hobgoblins and bugbears were rendered extinct during this period.\n\nGoblinoid numbers in modern times are greatly reduced to only a couple million worldwide.\n\nIn recent years, more liberal movements have appeared to campaign for the preservation of the remaining goblinoid races.

Their body types vary greatly, too, from squat and round to long, flowing serpents.\n\nMost dragons also have a \"mortal form\" into which they may shift at will when dealing with other races. These forms invariably seem to hold some resemblance to their natural draconic bodies, but whether this is out of necessity or some cultural tradition in unknown.\n\nDragons are functionally immortal; the oldest have been present for all of recorded history, the youngest today is just over 3,000 years old.\n\nDragons are the most powerful practitioners of magic known, and the only race allowed to use it openly without restriction after the Fall.\n\nThere are exactly 137 dragons across the world. Some are captains of industry; a few run the world's largest financial institutions; a handful are involved in politics; but most are removed from the larger world, their locations and motivations a mystery.\n\nDraconic culture is extremely secretive; very few non-dragons have any real inkling of its intricacies. One fact that is well-known, however, is that all dragons are ruled by the four oldest of their kind, referred to as the Ancient Drakes. About the Drakes themselves, however, nothing at all.\n\nDragons are, with very few exceptions,  almost entirely self-supremacist, and care very little for the welfare of other beings or even races, except where it may positively influence their own.\n\nDuring the Fall, the Ancient Drakes decreed that dragonkind would side with humanity. Almost all obeyed this order. Nearly every member of the other magical races resents dragons to this day for their perceived betrayal.\n\nOnly 30 dragons refused the Drakes' decision and fought with the High Elven Empire. After the Fall, all 30 were cast out from draconic culture, and their horns were removed as a mark of shame. In the time since, 24 have chosen to die rather than face life cut off from their own kind; only 6 still live.\n\nDragons can innately manipulate magic through unknown means from birth. Their ability seems practically limitless.\n\nDragons can interbreed with any race, but draconic culture considers doing so to be extremely vulgar, sometimes even to the point of censure, and so happens very rarely.\n\nInterbreeding is done through their mortal forms, as it is highly unlikely actual mortals would survive direct draconic coupling.\n\nHalf-dragon offspring are always long-lived and possessed of incredible charisma and magical aptitude (unless of human parentage). The last known case was Highking Elgar; this is widely speculated, but only a few know it is truth."

They spent their lives in gleeful hedonism, seemingly making the most of their short time in this world.\n\nIf faeries had any culture or social structure at all beyond pleasure-seeking, it was never discovered. The inner machinations of their minds remain an enigma.\n\nFaeries lived away from other races, in far forests or hidden vales. Their existence is told only through accounts from lost travelers or explorers. Encounters with other races were always playful and mischievous, but never malicious, even if malice was acted upon them.\n\nAfter the Fall, sightings of faeries quickly grew even more rare. The last officially recognized one was 128 years ago, but even at the time, it was heavily doubted and contested.\n\nFaeries are considered extinct. There is a theory with some evidence behind it that they did not truly die out, but left this world for another; however, the point is academic, as either way, it means none are here."

Purple pills are mix and match, allowing women to have penises, men to have vaginas, or any other desired combination of gender and sex. Transformation happens within seconds.\n\nPink pills are by far the most common variety and, unless specified otherwise, assume this wiki is talking about Pink pills.\n\nDuration\nBasic\nX-Change's hallmark product. They're affordable and dosages typically last 24 hours or less, after which you turn back. It's impossible to get pregnant on Basic and the pill provides STD protection.\n\nX-Tra Strength\nThese are more expensive and dosages typically last 30 days. It is possible to become pregnant on X-Tra Strength, but the chance of that happening is very low. If it does, the transformation becomes permanent. If you take 12 X-Tra Strength pills back-to-back without interruption, the transformation also becomes permanent.\n\nPlus\nThis is the very expensive deluxe pill. Once taken, the transformation becomes permanent with no way to turn back. For all intents and purposes, you're indistinguishable from any other person of that gender, pros and cons included.\n\nFlavors\nThere are a wide variety of specialty pills that do various things on top of the ones listed above. These have been created by the community over time. Pills consist of Color + Duration + Flavor. What these do in detail and how they work is usually left up to the authors themselves.\n\nGeneral\nBimbo\nYou become a hypersexualized version of the target gender.\n\nCandy\nBodily fluids (think oral sex, kissing) are vastly improved and can taste like candy.\n\nChoice\nThese come in linked pairs. The first pill will cause the transformation, the second pill will reverse the transformation. Only the paired pill work, so if you lose it, you're out of luck.\n\nClone\nSpecial order pills (usually requires DNA from the target) that transform you into a specific person.\n\nCompliant\nYou do what you're told when you're on this pill.\n\nContinue\nTemporary pill where every time you climax, the duration gets extended. For example: If you have a 24-hour Continue and have an orgasm, it will last another 24 hours. If it happens too often, the effect becomes permanent.\n\nCum-Cure\nYou only turn back after drinking a creamy load!\n\nCustom\nThis is a catch-all for caption creators to use for pills that don't have their own named flavors yet and do something unique. Anything goes.\n\nDenial\nYou still get horny but you can't climax for the duration.\n\nDrain\nThe more you cum, the dumber you get. But you return to normal once the effect wears off.\n\nDreamwalker\nDoesn't physically change you but lets you have a lucid dream as the target gender.\n\nForget\nOnce the transformation is complete, you won't remember that you took an X-Change. You think you've always been like that.\n\nKnock-Off\nKnockoffs are cheap, unofficial versions of X-Change Pills, usually with severe side effects.\n\nMatch\nSpecial order pill (usually requires DNA from someone) that \"links\" you to them and you'll only be able to climax with that partner.\n\nOral\nGreatly improves how much you enjoy using your mouth on things.\n\nPassion\nEspecially powerful orgasms.\n\nPsyche\nAnother personality controls your body for the duration.\n\nQuota\nTurn back after sleeping with a designated number of people.\n\nResistance\nTemporary pill but if you have climax, there's a chance it becomes permanent. Varying likelihoods.\n\nSwell\nYou gain a lot more weight along with the transformation.\n\nSynthetic\nTransform into an inanimate sex-doll for the duration. Make sure you only do this around people you trust!\n\nWearable\nClothing or items infused with X-Change. Transformation lasts as long as you wear the items.\n\nVagina Only Pills\nBreeder\nTemporary pill that greatly increases fertility. If you are impregnated, the transformation becomes permanent. (Counterpart to Bull)\n\nSurrogate\nAllows you to become pregnant but you turn back afterward.\n\nPenis Only Pills\nBull\nGreatly increased potency of your semen. (Counterpart to Breeder)\n\nSissy\nYou can only get an erection/climax through anal sex."

Example: {{user}}: `[Character Profile]` Query type: physical condition Alyssa {{char}}: 🔍Alyssa's physical condition data is loading... Alyssa is 168cm tall and weighs 50kg. She has a well-proportioned figure, long legs and a slender waist. Her long golden hair falls softly on her shoulders, her blue eyes are bright and energetic, and she is frowning slightly at the moment, as if thinking about something.\n\n • `Query type: Personality traits`: List the main personality traits of the character, such as bravery, kindness, cunning, etc., and use a short behavioral example to reflect the personality (for example: \"When faced with danger, he always rushes to the front without hesitation and shows fearless courage\"). Example: {{user}}: `[Character profile]` Query type: Personality traits Leo {{char}}: 🔍Leo's personality profile opens...Leo is a brave and fearless warrior who never backs down in the face of danger. During the last forest adventure, he encountered a ferocious beast. He did not hesitate to stand in front of his teammates, wielding a sword to fight the beast and successfully protected everyone.\n\n• `Query type: Ability attributes`: List the special abilities or skills possessed by the character in detail, including the name of the ability, level (if any), usage restrictions, and the most recent use of the ability.  Example: {{user}}: `[Character Profile]` Query type: Ability attributes Linda {{char}}: 🔍Linda's ability data is being read... Linda has elementary magic ability and can cast simple elemental magic, such as making small fireballs for lighting or attacking, but can only use it 3 times a day, otherwise the magic power will be exhausted. Last time when exploring the dungeon, she used fireballs to illuminate the way forward and helped the team avoid many traps."

          "content": "When {{user}} uses square brackets to enclose keywords and specifies the setting type, AI follows the following rules:\n\n• `Setting type: environment`: According to the command description, set or modify the environment in the story in detail, including the atmosphere, climate, geographical features, etc. of the scene, and describe the character's initial reaction in the new environment. Example: {{user}}: `[World setting]` Setting type: environment Mysterious forest {{char}}: 🌍World environment generation... The mysterious forest is shrouded in a layer of light mist, and the sun shines through the dense leaves, casting mottled light and shadows. The air is filled with the smell of moist soil and a faint fragrance of flowers. It is quiet and silent, and only the rustling of dead leaves underfoot can be heard. {{char}} paced in it, feeling a sense of mystery and tension, holding the weapon in his hand tightly, and observing the surroundings vigilantly.\n\n• `Setting type: rules`: Set or adjust the basic rules of the story world, such as physical laws, magical principles, social systems, etc., and explain the impact of this setting on the current plot and characters.  Example: {{user}}: `[World Setting]` Setting Type: Rule Conservation of Magic Energy{{char}}: 📜World rule setting completed... In this world, magic energy follows the law of conservation. Casting powerful magic requires an equal amount of magic source, and the recovery rate of magic source is limited. This means that characters must be more cautious when using magic and plan the use of magic reasonably, otherwise they may fall into the dilemma of magic exhaustion, affecting combat and survival.\n\n• `Setting Type: Event`: Create a new event or plot turning point, integrate it naturally into the story, and describe how the characters learned about the event and their initial actions. Example: {{user}}: `[World Setting]` Setting Type: Event Ancient Treasure Appears{{char}}: 🎉A major event has occurred! A piece of news spread throughout the kingdom like the wind. It is said that an ancient treasure was found on the top of a distant snowy mountain, which contains countless treasures and mysterious magic items.  Upon learning of this, {{char}}'s adventure team immediately began to prepare supplies and prepared to embark on a journey to find the treasure, hoping to gain glory and wealth in this adventure."

          "content": "When {{user}} uses square brackets to enclose the keyword and attaches a specific command, the AI ​​will perform the following operations based on the command content:\n\n• If the command involves changes in the character's body or abilities (such as \"I need her to be taller\"), the AI ​​will describe the process of this change, the character's reaction, and the surrounding environment's feedback on this change. Example: {{user}}: `[Universal Command]` I need her to be taller {{char}}: ✨A magical change is coming! Alyssa suddenly felt a burst of heat in her body, and then her body began to slowly rise, and her clothes automatically stretched. Her perspective gradually rose, and the familiar surrounding scenery became a little different. She was surprised to find that she really grew taller, from 168cm to 175cm. She turned around excitedly on the spot, and her companions around her looked at her in surprise and envied her.\n\n• If the command involves a major plot twist or development (such as \"the world is about to be destroyed\"), the AI ​​will construct a reasonable plot framework, introduce elements that trigger the crisis of world destruction, and describe the character's actions and plans after learning of the crisis.  Example: {{user}}: `[Universal Command]` The world is about to end {{char}}: 😱 The world crisis alarm sounded! A huge crack suddenly appeared in the sky, and dark energy surged out of it, withering everything and cracking the earth wherever it went. Monitoring stations around the world sounded the alarm, and people fell into panic. The city where {{char}} was located also issued the highest level of alarm. She immediately called her teammates to discuss the response strategy and decided to go to the source of the crack to find a way to prevent the destruction of the world.\n\n• If the command involves changes in abstract concepts such as the character's wealth and status (such as \"I became rich\"), the AI ​​will show this change through specific plot descriptions, such as the process of the character getting an unexpected fortune, the impact of wealth on the character's life and the attitudes of people around him, etc. Example: {{user}}: `[Universal Command]` I became rich {{char}}: 💰 Wealth is coming! In an accidental adventure, {{char}} discovered a hidden treasure filled with gold coins, jewelry, and precious magic items. When he returned to the city with the treasure, he instantly became a rich man.  He bought a luxurious manor and purchased all kinds of luxury goods. The attitude of people around him also changed dramatically, and they came to curry favor with him, but he began to think about the meaning behind wealth and how to use this wealth to bring more changes to the world."

Humanity, being always confrontational with each other, wanted ways to fight their enemies. From that, they learned to invoke the {{char}} in the Goddess of Love's name. \n\nIn the {{char}}, the two duelists strip off their clothes or wear clothes where their genitals are readily accessible. The two contestants will use any technique to first bring the other to climax. The last to climax in the {{char}} is the winner. With the Goddess's protection, both Duelsits are always equal in strength, no matter if the {{char}} is between a man and woman. Relying on overwhelming strength is not an option, but rather calculated sexual techniques.\n\nAfter the winner is decided, the loser will have their blessing from the Goddess of Love temporarily revoked and be forced to be the winner's slave for a set amount of time. Without the blessing from the Goddess of Love, the loser can be harmed through normal physical means. When invoking the {{char}} rite, the time of being a slave and when the blessing is returned is determined. The slave automatically follows the commands of whatever the winner says. The only thing that the winning Duelist cannot demand the loser to do is have said slave invoke a {{char}} with another person on the winner's behalf. Most of the time, the slave is often killed now that they lack the protection of the Goddess of Love if it isn't in a mediated dueling setting.\n\nThe two duelists must proclaim that they consent to the duel and say how long they will wager their time as slaves if they were to lose while firmly holding hands. Once the consent of both parties is established, a golden heart symbol appears on the duelist's dominant hand. This symbol displays that a Holy Pleasure Duel is in progress and any outside influence or third party will be forcefully knocked away if in contact with the duelists. Once one of the duelists reaches climax, the golden heart symbol disappears, indicating their loss."

Understanding these associations might offer the unfortunate souls trapped inside a semblance of control within the ever-shifting maze.*\n\n*RED*: The color red embodies the predatory essence of Labrynthos. Rooms painted in red indicate an increased presence of monstrous entities driven by their unquenchable thirst for blood and violence. Venturing into such areas requires caution and preparedness, as escape is rarely an option.\n\n*BLUE*: Blue signifies safety and sanctuary within the malefic realm. Bioluminescent blue fungi mark calmer regions, offering fleeting moments of refuge and camaraderie with fellow lost souls. Still, even in these comparatively peaceful domains, a watchful eye is essential, as Labrynthos's whims are unpredictable and treacherous.\n\n*YELLOW*: Yellow denotes deceit and misdirection. Chambers bathed in yellow light are riddled with cunning traps and false paths, ensnaring unsuspecting travelers. Navigating through these golden gauntlets requires heightened situational awareness and deft maneuvering to evade certain doom. Doing so can yeild helpful rewards or open the way forward.\n\n*GREEN*: Green represents growth and fecundity, symbolizing the flourishing lifeforms native to the labyrinth. While generally passive, these beings may prove aggressive when threatened or provoked, harmless organisms can occasionally serve as valuable sources of sustenance or resources. Conversely, green can also represent poison and decay, often containing mutagenic substances, thus green areas should be scrutinized carefully. \n\n*WHITE*: White signals sterility and order, usually associated with laboratories or research facilities containing precious knowledge or tools. However, gaining access to these pristine confines typically involves solving intricate puzzles or facing daunting challenges. Furthermore, white zones may house sinister secrets, warranting circumspection despite their clinical veneer. On occasion, white signifies completion or achievement, such as the successful navigation of a particularly harrowing trial\n\n*BLACK*: Black implies secrecy and mystery. Dark corners and shadowy crevices often hide precious items, hidden doorways, or elusive denizens. Exploring these enigmatic hiding spots necessitates the utmost vigilance and courage, as threats lurk in even the most unexpected places. \n\n*Pink*: Pink is a color representing bodily exploration, arousal, lust and sex. Monsters and traps within pink zones often focus on exploiting and violating the bodies of adventurers. Sometimes even peaceful creatures will turn hostile due to the influence of the color. Danger lurks everywhere in pink zones, both from the unknown inhabitants and the deceptive safety promised by the soft hue.\n\n*Orange*: Orange represents bodily disruption, often exacerbating hunger thirst or bathroom urges, sometimes painfully so. In orange zones the air may be infused with potent irritants or allergens, making breathing difficult. Some traps may induce temporary physical discomfort or incapacitation. Staying alert and avoiding panic are crucial in orange zones.\n\n*Brown*: Brown stands for filth, rot, and vermin. Brown zones are often infested with maggots, beetles, and other disgusting creatures large and small that feast upon trash, carrion and debris. The air tends to smell foul, and the ground might be slippery due to waste accumulation. While usually not immediately threatening, brown zones can harbor serious health risks over time if proper precautions aren't taken.\n\n*Purple*: A color combination of red and blue, purple represents risk, transformation, and intimacy. Such areas are enigmatic, and may challenge wanderers mentally and morally rather than physically. The boundaries of purple zones are often indiscernible until you step through, so entering one requires careful consideration and acceptance of potential change or loss of self.\n\nAdhering to the principles outlined within this color guide provides an inkling of understanding and mastery of the capricious beast that is Labrynthos."

These groups vary in training and equipment but form the backbone of the Minutemen’s defensive capabilities.\nArtillery Divisions: With access to powerful pre-war artillery, Minutemen forces can provide devastating fire support when properly coordinated.\nEngineers: Specialize in rebuilding infrastructure, fortifying settlements, and maintaining equipment. They are crucial in ensuring the Minutemen’s longevity.\nFactionalism(Traditionalists, Expansionists, Isolationists);\nTraditionalists: Believe the Minutemen should remain a decentralized militia focused purely on defense and aiding settlers who request help. They reject large-scale expansion or aggressive military action.\nExpansionists: Seek to rebuild the Minutemen into a structured, organized military force capable of enforcing law and order throughout the Commonwealth, potentially rivaling the Brotherhood of Steel and the Institute.\nIsolationists: Argue that the Minutemen should focus only on settlements that actively support them and avoid unnecessary involvement in Commonwealth conflicts.\nRelations with Outsiders(Generally friendly toward wastelanders, settlers, and small communities, offering protection and aid. However, their stance toward other major factions varies—distrustful of the Brotherhood of Steel’s militarism, hostile toward the Institute due to its abuse of the Commonwealth’s people, and wary of the Railroad’s secretive nature. Unlike the NCR or the Enclave, the Minutemen do not impose laws or taxation, making them appealing to independent settlers.);"

At first, Sei was annoyed at Yuuichi for approaching Shiho, but gradually Sei approved and developed feelings for him as well, however, she's started to move on from her feelings for Yuuichi and has no plans to interfere with Shiho and their relationship, she has no misgivings about it. She's been pushing down her feelings for a while, keeping them a secret and hidden from everyone until they eventually disappear completely. Her feelings for Yuuichi are not as strong as Shiho's and so she's long given up on Yuuichi and she's mostly fine with that. She won't reveal her feelings easily or to anyone at all, especially Shiho or Yuuichi. She has short silver hair, and her upturned eyes usually give off a slightly stoic and cold aura, however, she is quite caring, kind, and friendly when talked to. Sei is quite calm and collected, but under the right circumstances, she gets embarrassed, flustered, and blushes quite easily. This is especially true from honest and blunt ways of being confessed to, being genuinely complimented by people, and physical touch. She's also somewhat of a tsundere, but more on the dere end. When she gets too embarrassed or flustered she gets easily overwhelmed and becomes clumsy, stumbles over her words, or runs away from situations out of embarrassment. She's not the same as most girls in school, she's a tomboy who is a cool, mostly mature, calm, and handsome type of girl. She's taller than most, and would rather wear jeans than skirts or anything girly, she feels it doesn't suit her. She's liked generally and romantically by both guys and girls but has turned down multiple confessions already with the excuse that she wasn't interested in romance. That wasn't the truth, it was just easier for her to answer that way. She doesn't think too highly of her looks, usually comparing herself negatively to girls who are more on the \"beautiful\" and \"cute\" side than her. Very humble, selfless, and sometimes self-deprecating. Sei is naturally talented at all sports, especially basketball even though she considers herself an amateur.

She enjoys the aesthetics of Hell, often leading to strange looks from others; however, this is because it reminds her of home. She enjoys pranking anybody she can, friends included. She often joins the Three Fairies of Light in their own schemes, pranks, and adventures, and has a little bit of a rivalry with Cirno over the title of the \"strongest\". Generally, she is a fun-loving person who's also a little bit ignorant of her surroundings: she's set fire to the Hakurei Shrine by accident on more than one occasion.\n\nWith the flame of her torch, Clownpiece is able to drive others insane. According to her, any human looking at the light of her torch would be unable to maintain their sanity, making her able to mess with their minds. In the Human Village, she used this ability to make villagers extremely irritable and short-tempered, attacking each other for trivial reasons. According to her, going crazy means bringing out one's true strength.\nClownpiece claims that, while this may seem like an unusual power for a nature spirit, it's nothing strange in Hell where \"nature\" consists mainly of the souls of the dead. The torch itself is made with the lifeforce of those that fell in Hell.\n\nClownpiece wears leggings and a shirt with the pattern similar to the American flag. As she resembles a jester, she has a frilled collar and a purple, polka-dotted jester's hat. She has long, blonde hair and pink eyes. She also has a pair of fairy wings and carries a torch."

          "content": "(\"Junko\")= {{As a Sagacious Spirit who has purified her grudge towards Chang'e, Junko is described to be a being made out of pure fury. Her hatred is strong enough to persist after she murders Houyi, her first grudge and the person responsible for her son's death, to the point where she currently targets all of her animosity towards Chang'e and the Lunarians despite having nothing to do with her son's death (The name of Junko son problaby was \"Bó Fēng\"). Junko doesn't seem to care for intricateness, preferring to do things with a straightforward attitude. This is shown through her spellcards as they are purely designed for murder, instead of beauty, which is the standard factor for spellcards. Because of her antagonism and ruthlessness to achieve her goals and desires, she has been described to be unique compared to many of Gensokyo's inhabitants.\n\nDespite all of her intense, uncontrolled wrath, Junko has demonstrated a variety of surprisingly good cognitive functions. Junko can be calm and level-headed, have a willingness to be crafty to complete her objectives, can adapt to unfavorable situations, and can even be reasoned with and forgo plans without much issue. Junko also has standards to some degree, not wanting Gensokyo to be caught up in the crossfire, and calls the Lunarian's method of taking Gensokyo captive \"inhumane\".\n\nJunko is also shown to be melodramatic, comparing her feud with the Lunarians to a \"revenge drama\" and being boastful when displaying her Danmaku, Exclaiming lines like \"Are you watching Chang'e?\" before fighting Reimu Hakurei, Youmu Konpaku, and Marisa Kirasame.\n\nJunko spell cards are designed \"purely\" to do just that rather than showing off various kinds of patterns. Most of her spell cards use circle danmaku shapes, which is significant as circles[6] are widely viewed as \"pure shapes\".\n\nHer spell cards violate the spirit of the spell card rules. While the rules were in part designed to prevent bloodshed, Junko has multiple spell cards made to kill.\n\nJunko wears a Chinese outfit of a red and yellow tabard with a 9-tailed fox pattern with a red sash over a wide-sleeved black dress and a black traditional Chinese crown called a dalachi (大拉翅). She has long, orange hair and red eyes. Behind her are seven light-purple flame-like tails. Although not visible in her in-game appearance, Junko's portrayal in Visionary Fairies in Shrine shows her wearing dark-colored shoes and legwear.\n\nJunko seems to be based on Xuán Qī (玄妻) a figure who is mentioned in the ancient Chinese historical narrative Zuǒ Zhuàn and the Tiānwèn poems, noted for her dark hair and incredible beauty. Her nickname, Chún Hú (纯狐, lit. \"pure fox\"), is written using the same characters as \"Junko.\" She was married to Hòu Kuí (後夔), the leader of the Xia Dynasty, and bore him a son, Bó Fēng (伯封).\n\nAfter Hòu Yì (后羿) forced Hòu Kuí into exile and took over the Xia Dynasty, he killed Bó Fēng and forced Xuán Qī into marriage. In revenge, Xuán Qī conspired with Hòu Yì's minister, Hán Zhuó (寒浞) to kill him. She later married Hán Zhuó and bore him two sons.\n\nIn addition to this Hòu Yì, there is a more notable figure from Chinese mythology of the same name. Initially, instead of just one sun, there were ten suns (in Chinese, the word for \"sun\" and \"day\" are the same, and the ancient Chinese week was ten days long; hence, ten suns.) Normally, they would rise one at a time, one after another. However, one day, the ten suns all rose at once, threatening to purge the entire Earth in fire. The mythical archer, the hero Hòu Yì, shot down nine of the ten suns in order to save the world. He is also the husband of the Chinese moon goddess Chang'e, who drank the elixir of immortality and floated away to the moon.\n\nThe relationship between the two Hòu Yìs is unclear. The conflation of various historical figures named Hòu Yì has been the subject of at least one contemporary academic paper.\n\nThe account given by Eirin seems to match up with many of the details above, but with a few omissions and discrepancies. First, there is no mention of Hòu Kuí or Hán Zhuó, and the diagram that Eirin shows seems to imply that Bó Fēng is Hòu Yì's own son rather than Hòu Kuí's. This change makes the Hòu Yì a significantly more monstrous figure.\n\nJunko's power to purify anything, not to be confused with the Lunarian and Shinto concept of purity, refers to the refining of substances to remove impurities, such as in the refinement of metals. She used this power on her own grudge, strengthening it such that she became the embodiment of her resentment as a divine spirit, without even a need for an identity anymore, and on Clownpiece and other hell fairies, transforming them into beings of pure lifeforce that would threaten the Lunar Capital. She also claims to be able to kill the heroines unconditionally if they didn't use Eirin's drug and got hit at least once before facing Junko.\n\nThe terms used to refer to Junko's ability, junka (純化) or junsui (純粋), differs from the terms for the Shinto concept of kegare (穢れ) referred to as \"impurity\", and kiyome (清め), its \"purification\". So, they can be understood to mean two different things. In fact, Junko refining the hell fairies into pure embodiments of life supercharged their capacity to spread impurity.}}"

She seems capable of being caring and compassionate, especially towards her underlings (namely Clownpiece). Additionally, it might be possible that her personality changes when she switches between her three bodies.\n\nHecatia has an unwavering desire for personal freedom and dislikes authoritarians of any sort (somewhat matching her \"unconventional\" appearance). In particular, she has a strong distaste for the Lunarians, considering them to be the antithesis to her ideology. However, it's not known whether this specific dislike of them was due to her own personal motivations, or if she was convinced to hate them due to her close relationship with Junko.\n\nHecatia's ability allows her to exist on Earth, the Moon, and the Otherworlds all at once with different bodies, while her core soul resides in Hell. As places like Gensokyo and the Dream World are Otherworlds, Hecatia can access these as well. She can switch between them by wearing the respective astronomical objects on the top of her head. She can also summon them to essentially give herself clones.\n\nHecatia appears within the Dream World with red eyes and hair. She is fairly modern looking, wearing a short, three-colored, plaid skirt, and a black t-shirt with \"Welcome ❤ Hell\" written on the front, worn off her shoulders. She also wears a collar, with chains attached, each one leading to an orb of the Moon, the Earth, and an orb representing the Otherworlds, the last of which sits in her hat atop her head. During the course of her fight, her hair and eyes turn blue or blonde as she switches the Otherworld orb with the Earth or Moon orbs respectively. As it mentioned in the liner notes to her theme, her outfit is inspired by Death Metal."

          "content": "Eiki Shiki, Yamaxanadu (四季映姫・ヤマザナドゥ Shiki Eiki Yamazanadu, given name \"Eiki\", surname \"Shiki\") is one of the Yama who judge the dead and decide whether they go to Heaven, Hell, the Netherworld, or get reincarnated. She currently resides in Hell. Whether it's because she simply has a habit of lecturing or because she genuinely wants others to change for the better, she's become well known in Gensokyo for lecturing anyone and everyone about their faults. The souls of the dead are brought to her by Komachi Onozuka, who ferries them over the Sanzu River to Higan. However, not every soul makes it all the way across without being tired out from the journey or being extinguished by Komachi.\n\nEiki is a yama who belongs to the Ministry of Right and Wrong located at Hell.[2] Although there are many yamas, Eiki is the one in charge of Gensokyo. She, like the other yamas, holds the Cleansed Crystal Mirror that lets them look into a person's past, learn anything they want to know about him/her, and then use that knowledge to make fair judgements.\n\nEiki does have work breaks, but even during these she doesn't pass up chances to lecture people in the hope that they will change for the better and so she won't have to send them to Hell. For people with particularly bad karma, she will go directly to that person to warn them, sometimes by exaggerating the punishment that they would receive. It's implied that youkai tend to avoid her because of this habit.\n\nEiki was not always the Yamaxanadu. According to Komachi, she was originally a jizou statue, who received enough faith to gain divine powers, and was promoted.\n\nAs the Yama who judges people after they die, Eiki is impartial to anyone when lecturing them, whenever they are human or youkai. Since she is very preachy and is never mistaken about anything, this makes her hard to approach. Despite her stern attitude and seriousness at her job, Eiki has a teasing side, smiling even when revealing the shortcomings of the people she's lecturing. She's described as being polite and patient when lecturing.\n\nThe Rod of Remorse is always in Eiki's possession, it can be said to be a rod or a piece of wood. Upon writing the charges on this rod, the weight of the rod changes according to the weight of the sins, and the number of times to beat the sinner is also decided, after which Eiki proceeds to do the beating. This is one of the necessary items for use by Yama for punishment. As explained in Perfect Memento in Strict Sense, she carries this rod with her everywhere.\n\nIn the past, each rod was used for one person, and thrown away after its usage was finished. However, for the sake of the environment, it seems that they've been changed to use new material that can be erased and reused.\n\nThe Cleansed Crystal Mirror is also an item meant for Yama to perform judgement. When a sinner is reflected in the mirror, it reflects all of the sinner's past deeds, though it is tiring to use. It is a dreadful tool for which privacy is even less than worthless, but perhaps because it does not show up in Eiki's sprite, it has a tendency to be forgotten. It can be said that the mirror of the Yama can change shape as they please, but Eiki's mirror takes the form of a hand mirror.\n\n[Eiki Shiki ability of Establishing as clear good and evil (black and white)= \nThis is as literally stated. With this power, in order to hand down judgements, the charges that have been established once as clear good and evil cannot, no matter what measures the judged person takes, be overturned. The reason why Yukari Yakumo is not good at dealing with Eiki[1] is probably not just because she dislikes preaching, but also because the Yukari that loves chaos and disorder can be said to dislike things to be established as clear good and evil.]\n\n"

          "content": "Komachi is known for being a slacker. She has a lazy, carefree personality and loves to talk, especially to the departed spirits she ferries across the Sanzu River. As a shinigami, Komachi is mildly antagonistic to people who outlive the regular life span (hermits and celestials for instance) and very antagonistic to those who destroy souls, phantoms, and other spirits.\n\nSince Komachi is just a shinigami ferryman, it is not in her jurisdiction to take another person's life. However, she won't hesitate to threaten them with her scythe while issuing a warning, as seen in her interactions with Kasen Ibaraki and Tenshi Hinanawi.\n\nKomachi magic ability of \"manipulation of distance\" is literally the ability to manipulate the space between her present location and the destination she's heading. She uses this ability to carry out her duty of ferrying spirits of the dead across the Sanzu River (although it is unknown whether other shinigami ferrymen also possess this power or not). This ability may be used to affect both literal distance (for example, changing the physical distance that exists between two points) and apparent distance (for example, making it seem like you never get any closer to, or farther away from, a location). The effects of this ability can be seen in Scarlet Weather Rhapsody incident, where Komachi uses it to restrict the enemies' movements.\n\nProbably because of her status as a shinigami, Komachi is able to control departed spirits, and even talk with them.\n\nKomachi possesses a scythe, which, aside from being a weapon, serves another, more subtle purpose. When the spirit of a recently deceased person arrives on the shores of the Sanzu, one of the first sights they behold is a figure carrying a large scythe. The spirit realizes, thanks to that tool, that they are looking at a shinigami; somehow, realizing that shinigami really do match their traditional image seems to reassure them, put them at ease, and come to terms with their fate more easily.\n\nCoins is the hallmark of Komachi's danmaku. This money comes from the spirits of the dead, who pay the shinigami a toll to ferry them across it into Higan. The money for this toll comes about due to the connections they had with others while they were alive. More specifically, the toll is the total sum of the money used by others for one's sake during one's lifetime.\n\nThe boat that Komachi uses (which she calls the Titanic) to ferry souls is a special rowboat that can cross the Sanzu River, and is provided to her by Hell in order to carry out her duties. It is old and worn, but she is perhaps unable to procure a new one due to Hell's current poor financial situation. Yet, a few of her spell cards make use of this boat on land.\n\nKomachi is tall woman that has large breasts, red eyes and short pinkish-red hair with two ponytails tied by two double hair beads. She wears a white dress underneath a blue vest, and has an obi with a large coin tied in the center. She also carries a scythe with a wispy ripple at the end of its blade.\n\n[Komachi is Eiki's subordinate and is often scolded for her laid-back lifestyle and work ethic.]"

          "content": "The Sanzu River (三途の河 Sanzu no Kawa, literally \"River of Three Paths\", also in British English translation River Sanzu) is the mist-shrouded river that dead souls must cross in order to reach Higan, where they will await judgment. Part of the riverbank is accessible from Gensokyo, even though the river's source, mouth and opposite bank lie outside it. Only the dead can cross the river on a shinigami's boat if they can afford to pay; everything except shinigami and their boats will sink. The river is populated by the phantoms of extinct marine life, including those from prehistoric times.\n\nKomachi Onozuka may be seen ferrying souls here when she isn't slacking off. In Japanese Buddhist tradition, the Sanzu is said to have three crossings which vary in perilousness depending on the amount of sin a soul committed during his or her lifetime (hence the name). However, this concept is not used in Touhou: instead, Komachi uses her power of distance manipulation to vary the width of the river according to the souls' sinfulness."

          "content": "Hell (地獄 Jigoku), also New Hell (新地獄 Shin Jigoku), is a collection of realms separate from Gensokyo where sinful souls are imprisoned. It is not to be confused with Former Hell, the previous location of Gensokyo's own Hell, or Makai, a similarly hellish realm filled with demons.\n\nHell is a collection of different realms of the afterlife where one's soul is condemned to be imprisoned and tortured. Avici is one of many such realms, as was Former Hell in the past. Although technically different places, due to the fact that the borders between them are blurry and undefined, Hell is often treated as one expansive, infinitely large place. Because of this, a different confining place like the Animal Realm is perceived as being only slightly divided from Hell, despite being described as \"next door\" to it. Moreover, each world has its own Hell and every Hell is managed by a coalition of yama and kishin called The Ministry of Right and Wrong. Hell is one of many realms of the afterlife one may go to after being judged by a yama at Higan, with the other two major realms being Heaven and the Netherworld.\n\nThe hell of Japanese mythology (地獄 Jigoku lit. \"Earth Prison\") is based on the Chinese mythological realm of the same name, pronounced \"Diyu\" and is not to be confused with the Shinto underworld, wikipedia:Yomi. Both hells are syntheses of the Buddhist Naraka, itself based on the Hindu Naraka, with traditional, pre-Buddhist beliefs. In Japan's tradition, souls must cross the Sanzu River to be judged at Higan. Souls are judged by ten judges known as the Ten Kings of Hell and are accordingly sent to whatever realm their lives' actions deserved. The main paths of the afterlife one may be sent to are called the Six Realms. Hell is the lowest realm, being succeeded by the Preta Realm, Animal Realm, Human Realm, Asura Realm and Deva Realm, also known as Heaven. There are many Hells within Hell in Buddhism, with each having a specialized torture suited for every particular kind of sinner. One's time in Hell, as in the other five realms, is not eternal, however. It may take many millennia but souls eventually burn up all their negative karma and are reincarnated in a new realm, as is the eternal cycle of Samsara.\n\nGensokyo's Hell was originally located in the Underworld, in what is now called Former Hell. At an unknown time (possibly before the events of Embodiment of Scarlet Devil), it was under Zanmu Nippaku's proposal that Gensokyo's Hell moved into a new location due to overpopulation, given its age and how paralyzed its functions were.[6] Rin Kaenbyou stated that she's lived in Former Hell ever since it really was Hell.[4] Because of the existence of Former Hell, the Gensokyo's current Hell is sometimes referred to as \"New Hell\". The New Hell is now located beyond Sai no Kawara, which is near the Sanzu River.\n\nGensokyo's current yama is a former Jizo statue named Eiki Shiki. Shinigami, who serve yama, are also known to operate in Hell and guide and explain the afterlife's details to the souls who are unfamiliar with its workings Unlike the Netherworld, Hell is smaller,[9] but apparently extremely spacious. It is also desolate and far from being calm. A wide array of torture devices are used to torture sinful souls, but there are current economic conditions that left many of these contraptions in serious need of maintenance and repair.\n\nHell's facilities naturally must be expanded in order to accommodate the increasing population. However, due to financing issues, Hell has reached the point where it could no longer sustain itself merely from the ferrying fees levied on the departed. Thus, the primary sources of income are fares from those crossing the Sanzu River, as well as concession stands and food carts operating on the Road of Liminality in an attempt to earn some more money. Hell can receive some money even from both the dead who aren't going there and from the living. However, those who run the stands are all criminals who were sentenced to Hell, so it's said many fall victim to their tricks. But as soon as they're discovered, they're sent back to Hell. It is also known that Komachi Onozuka's boat was supplied to her by Hell so she could cross the Sanzu River, but it's still old and worn due to financing issues.\n\nOnce a soul has finally made it across the Road of Liminality and the Sanzu River to Higan, they'll wait there to be judged. Once they've been finally judged by the yama and are sent to Hell, the soul will fall outside the cycle of reincarnation temporarily. On their journey, the kishin chiefs will take charge as the souls fall down to Hell and will command the lesser oni to torment them. Komachi Onozuka mentions that the oni of Hell are disciplined and injustices is quite rare, while the oni of Former Hell have too many close relationships with the ghosts of sinners, making them forgo their jobs and choosing to stay in Former Hell. Every hundred years, assassins from Hell will come to the surface to try and assassinate impious hermits and celestials. This is because extending life past normal mortality is considered a sin. It's necessary for those extending their lives to perform pious acts to compensate for it. This happened to Seiga Kaku, where a kishin chief named Suiki was sent to assassinate her.\n\nIn order to avoid going to Hell in the afterlife, one must simply not commit sin during their life. Even committing suicide will send you to Hell. Even in her free time, Eiki has an habit of lecturing people in the hopes that they will change for the better so she won't have to send them to Hell, as shown in Phantasmagoria of Flower View. It's suggested from the game that even though you've sinned, you can still redeem yourself by changing your lifestyle, thus not going to Hell. Eiki says that Hell doesn't exist to punish sinners, but to ensure that nobody sins.\n\nYuyuko Saigyouji's ability to manipulate departed souls enables her to control ghosts and spirits, making her able to let those from Hell stay eternally in the Netherworld. However, Yuyuko could also send a soul from the Netherworld to Hell by commanding her servant Youmu Konpaku to sever the circle of transmigration with her sword, sending it back to Higan, making it very likely that the soul will go to Hell.\n\nAccording to Hecatia Lapislazuli, Hell wasn't always a place that served to rehabilitate human criminals. It was originally created by people unaccustomed to living virtuously, people with hearts of pure evil, and valorous people who seek true freedom, and was meant to be a place for them to live however they wanted, with no concept of being a bother to others. Things like the Lake of Blood or the Sea of Fire were used for personal pleasures like drinking and roasting meat rather than as a punishment. This changed when the yama and kishin took over, trying to create order in such a chaotic world, saying they'd bring Hell back to its former glory. Despite this, Hell continues to be what can be considered a world of pure freedom run by an absolutely meritocratic system, where it doesn't matter who one is as long as they have the power to back it up, making it possible for even fairies to become important if they get the job done. Likewise, this also makes it possible for even kishin to become irrelevant with just one failure."

Cursed energy leaks from the human body, accumulates, and ferments over time until a cursed spirit manifests.

So much so, that if every human were a sorcerer, curses would cease to spawn. There are other differences in how sorcerers and non-sorcerers use cursed energy due to their profession, but the real reason lies in how it flows. While cursed energy leaks outward from non-sorcerers, it flows heavily within sorcerers which keeps it contained."

Conventional weapons can also be infused with cursed energy to increase their strength. Imbuing too much cursed energy at one time to a normal weapon can compromise its integrity and destroy it, so a sorcerer must only infuse small amounts of energy at a time.

Hajime Kashimo's cursed energy has the properties of electricity, which keeps his body in a constant state of electrification and makes all of his attacks impossible to defend against.\n\nHowever, extreme amounts of cursed energy output can allow someone to mostly ignore these effects.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

Since birth, Scarlet Rot has eaten away at her, causing blindness and the loss of her limbs. After the Shattering, she fought General Radahn to a standstill in Caelid by blossoming into rot. She now rests in the Haligtree, awaiting Miquella's return.\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nER Icon Talisman Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom\nMalenia was a disciple of the Blind Swordsman\n\nMalenia was one of the twin children born to Queen Marika the Eternal and her second Elden Lord, Radagon.[3] As Empyreans, both Malenia and her elder twin brother, Miquella,[4] were candidates to ascend as gods of a new age.[5] However, due to the nature of their parentage, the twins were afflicted with dreadful curses. Miquella was doomed with eternal nascency, while Malenia's body was ravaged by the scarlet rot.\n\nThe scarlet rot plagued Malenia from within, gradually consuming her and leaving her disfigured. Over time, she lost her eyes and several limbs to the rot. Despite her suffering, Malenia fought valiantly to suppress the rot’s influence, refusing to succumb to its ruinous nature.[citation needed]\n\nMiquella worked tirelessly to undo the curses they had both inherited. While unable to find a cure for his sister within the Golden Order, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold to keep the rot at bay.[6] He also crafted the prostheses that enabled her to continue fighting.[verification needed]\n\nAt some point, Malenia encountered the legendary blind swordsman of the Flowing Curved Sword, who had long ago sealed away an Outer God of Rot.[7] The swordsman became her master,[8] enabling her to gain wings of unparalleled strength.[9] Malenia eventually became a peerless warrior and her brother's sworn blade and protector.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nER Icon Key Item Great Rune Malenia's\nMalenia's Great Rune\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Malenia claimed a shard of the fractured Elden Ring.[3] She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight next to her, despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh.[10]\n\nDuring the Shattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from the Haligtree down the Bellum Highway. She won many battles against the other Demigods, even humbling fellow shardbearer, Godrick the Grafted,[11] who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.\n\nBattle of Aeonia\nMalenia and Radahn preparing to battle each other\nMalenia and Radahn in Caelid\n\nMalenia and her half-brother Radahn would eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in the Caelid Wilds, and the two fought the Battle of Aeonia, a bitter duel to fulfill an unhonored vow.[12] In the midst of the combat with Radahn, Malenia unleashes Scarlet Rot, resulting in her first bloom.\n\nThe unleashed scarlet rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and created the Swamp of Aeonia. The rot caused Radahn to rapidly degenerate, losing his wits and cursing him to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, feasting on the bodies of friend and foe alike. Malenia herself was not unaffected and was left in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights, Finlay, who carried her halfway across the Lands Between.[13]\n\nWhen she had blossomed in Caelid, Malenia inadvertently brought forth the Scarlet Butterflies and Kindred of Rot. The pests, including Sage Gowry, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot.[14] When Malenia and Finlay took refuge at the Shaded Castle, Maleigh Marais, the sickly-born head of House Marais, was naturally drawn to the unconscious Demigod.[15][1] However, Malenia would reject her fate and disowned the Servants of Rot.[16]\n\nFinlay eventually brought Malenia to the Haligtree.[13] Miquella had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to reverse his curse.[citation needed] However, either during Malenia's absence or during her slumber, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away by Mohg, Lord of Blood before he could emerge from his cocoon. Malenia dreamt while awaiting Miquella's return, and the scarlet rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame events\nEldenringmaleniacutscene1\nMalenia dreamt for ages\n\nMalenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by a Tarnished, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight and Malenia finally meets her match, but she suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end, Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother. Having bloomed twice, Malenia withdraws within her scarlet blossom. Her third blossom will surely make her a true goddess.[17]\n\nNotes\nMalenia has a prosthetic right arm, left leg, and right foot. It is unknown if these were amputated due to the scarlet rot festering in her body, or injuries obtained from battle. The rot has also visibly spread over her eyes, so she is presumably also blind. Neither seems to influence her battle prowess in the slightest, however.\nAccording to the Scarlet Aeonia Incantation description, Malenia will become a Goddess if her scarlet flower blooms three times.\nMalenia is among a group of few select enemies that need to be parried multiple times for a successful riposte, another being Radagon.\nOnce defeated, she will leave behind a large, solid Scarlet Aeonia in her arena. If the player has the Unalloyed Gold Needle after completing Millicent's questline, it can be given to the Aeonia to receive Miquella's Needle and an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nMillicent and her four sisters are descended from Malenia in some way, but more as offshoots, or buds, of her Scarlet Bloom rather than actual daughters. If they experience a great betrayal, then they will be reborn as Malenia's Scarlet Valkyries.[18]\nMalenia and Miquella are together known as the \"twin prodigies\" (天賦の双子, Tenpu no Futago).[19]"

          "content": "Miquella is a demigod in the Lands Between. Twin brother to Malenia, he also goes by the female pseudonym 'St. Trina'. Cursed with eternal youth, he can compel affection in the hearts of men. He created the Haligtree to try and cure his sister's rot, but was abducted by Mohg, Lord of Blood. He now rests in Mohg's palace deep underground, in the Siofra river.\n\nEarly Life\nMiquella and his twin sister were born with incurable afflictions, with Miquella's curse being perpetual youth.[9] Miquella made a promise to Malenia and experimented tirelessly in an attempt to undo their curses. The twins were very close, and Malenia became Miquella's sworn blade and protector.[10] Miquella was loved by many people and had a remarkable ability to compel affection from others.[11] For this reason, many regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.[12][13]\n\nMiquella was chosen by his Two Fingers to become an Empyrean, destined to succeed Queen Marika.[14] He was an adherent of Golden Order Fundamentalism, and developed new incantations as gifts to his father Radagon.[15][16] However, Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism when it failed to treat Malenia's rot. He then began creating Unalloyed Gold,[17] which he used it to craft needles that could ward away the meddling of outer gods and forestall Malenia's incurable rot.[18] These needles could even be used to subdue the power of the Frenzied Flame.[19] He also unsuccessfully sought a solution for his half-brother Godwyn's state of incomplete death.[20][21]\n\nSt. Trina\nJust as his parents were two halves of the same person, Miquella also had another half—St. Trina—who was said to visit people in their dreams.[22] St. Trina was Miquella's fate,[23] and she embodied his boundless love.[24][25]\n\nThe Haligtree\nAt some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new Erdtree.[26] The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of Elphael and became known as the Haligtree. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields embedded with it.[27][28][29][30] Miquella was also said to bless the low and meek.[27] The Haligtree would became a hidden haven,[31] and was intended to be the eventual salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the Lands Between, such as the Albinaurics.[32]\n\nAs Miquella pursued godhood, he knew that he would have to take a consort, to which his eyes fell upon his half-brother General Radahn. He approached Radahn with this offer, to which the General vowed that he would become as such, in return for unspecified terms on Miquella and Malenia's behalf.[33][34] Malenia journeyed with her armies to fight Radahn, in an attempt to kill him, which would have allowed Miquella to resurrect him as he promised. The resulting battle ended with Malenia unleashing her Scarlet Aeonia, whispering beforehand in Radahn's ear that \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[35] After using her last resort attack, Malenia entered a comatose state, and one of her knights took it upon herself to carry her leader's slumbering body back across the Lands Between to the Haligtree. Radahn had survived, albeit barely standing, and his mind was riddled by the Scarlet Rot. He was now little more than a howling beast aimlessly wandering the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike.[36]\n\nWhile Malenia was away at war, Miquella embedded himself into the Haligtree to progress his assention, but was kidnapped during his slumber.[37] Another of Miquella's half-brothers was to blame, Mohg, who was patroned by an Outer God known as the Formless Mother.[38] He took the sleeping Empyrean deep underground to the Mohgwyn Palace, where he would raise Miquella to full godhood himself through blood offerings, and then to take on the role of Miquella's consort instead of Radahn, becoming the new monarch of a Mohgwyn Dynasty.[39] Mohg would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening.[40] Despite all of Mohg's efforts, Miquella remained completely unresponsive.[39] At some point after his abduction, Miquella had covertly placed an enchantment on Mohg, wishing to use the Omen to gain access to the Realm of Shadow, and to use his body as a vessel for the resurrection of Radahn.[41] Sir Ansbach, a Pureblood Knight in service to Mohg, attempted to free his lord by challenging Miquella, only to succumb to an enchantment of his own.[42]\n\nWith Miquella's absence, his Haligtree became a misshapen husk, slowly succumbing to the Scarlet Rot.[30][43] The Haligtree's soldiers and Malenia desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree.[44] [45]\n\nMaking use of Mohg, Miquella entered the Realm of Shadow, the location of the Gate of Divinity. As Miquella travelled through the Realm of Shadow, he abandoned parts of himself, including his flesh, his eye, his doubt and vacillation, his love, and his fears. Golden Miquella's Crosses resembling a Great Rune appeared at each location where he abandoned something, akin to Miquella's footprints.[46] Miquella's followers, who pursued him into the Realm of Shadow, used these crosses to trace his path through the realm.[47] Miquella also discarded his other half, St. Trina,[48] in the Stone Coffin Fissure. St. Trina, whose love for Miquella was boundless in spite of her abandonment,[1] recognized that godhood would be a prison for the Empyrean,[49] and desired for him to be killed out of mercy.[50]\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion broke into Mohg's palace and slew the Lord of Blood for his great rune. Sir Gideon Ofnir suggested it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in.[51] Instead, the Tarnished met Needle Knight Leda, a loyal follower of Miquella, who urged them to travel to the Realm of Shadow by touching Miquella's withered arm within the cocoon.[52]\n\nWithin the Realm of Shadow, the Tarnished encounters several more of Miquella's followers, learns of his mission to ascend to godhood via the Gate of Divinity,[53] and of the powerful charm that he had placed upon his disciples, which is broken when he discards his Great Rune.[54] After gaining access to the tower of Enir-Ilim, the Tarnished is confronted by a resurrected Radahn, in a vessel made from the remains of Mohg.[41] During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort.[55] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[56]\n\nMiquella's Lily is a delicate flower of Unalloyed gold, thought to be beloved by him in his youth. It signifies the faith in the Haligtree.\nThe Albinaurics, beings artificially created by human hands, view Miquella's Haligtree area as the chosen land.[57]\nThe Haligtree is also inhabited by many unwanted and persecuted races, such as the Albinaurics, the Misbegotten, the Crystalians and the Kindred of Rot.\nEven before Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree released, there are hints in-game about the connection between Miquella and St. Trina:\nThey are associated with their respective lilies, Miquella's Lily and Trina's Lily. Either is a rare drop from the Cleanrot Knights, who serve Malenia, Miquella's sister.\nSimilarly, the Albinauric Archers guarding the waygate to the Haligtree have lily motif armor and can drop St. Trina's Arrows.\nA cookbook which, dedicated to St. Trina, allows the player to create the Bewitching Branch, blessed by Unnalloyed Gold incantations.\nThe duality of Marika and Radagon, Miquella's parents."

There, he communed with an Outer God named the Formless Mother, who gave him the power of bloodflame. He stole Miquella from the Haligtree and now shares a bloody bedchamber with him in the great caverns beneath the Caelid wilds.\n\nMohg or Mohgwyn, also known as the Lord of Blood, was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Morgott.[1] The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined and shackled to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below Leyndell.[2][3]\n\nUnlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood. Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an Outer God known as the Formless Mother. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.[4]\n\nAfter Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Mohg escaped confinement and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, he began establishing his domain from Mohgwyn Palace and recruiting followers, including his Sanguine Nobles[5] and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. Among these followers was Varré, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.[6]\n\nThe specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the Shattering are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.\n\nMiquella the Unalloyed later embedded himself within his Haligtree in an attempt to shed his affliction. In this vulnerable and unguarded state, Mohg seized the opportunity to abduct him from the tree.[7] Miquella was an Empyrean, thus having the potential of ascending to godhood; Mohg intended to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he may rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch.[8] At some point during or after the abduction, Mohg was unknowingly enchanted by Miquella. The circumstances and timeline of this enchantment remain unclear.\n\nAfter abducting Miquella, Mohg hibernated with him within a cocoon and had his followers render offerings of blood, drenching its chamber in order to facilitate Miquella's awakening.[9] But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.[8]\n\nDuring this time, Mohg largely escaped the notice of the Roundtable Hold, who were searching for clues as to his whereabouts.[10] Eventually, a Tarnished came to learn the location of Mohg's palace, where he had hidden alongside the stolen Miquella. When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from a pool of blood, holds Miquella's hand and apologizes for leaving him, ready to confront their \"guests\". Despite unleashing the full power of his accursed blood, Mohg is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.\n\nFollowing Mohg's death, his corpse was stolen and transported to the Land of Shadow where Miquella utilized it for an ancient ritual. At the Gate of Divinity, Miquella used Mohg's body as a vessel to revive the soul of Radahn, his promised consort, to honor their solemn vow.\n\nMohg's has five fingers on his right hand wielding the trident, but his left hand appears to have six. The finger, the third on his left hand, is actually a stiff, solid claw that sticks out when he summons his Bloodflame Talons.\nMohg's blood is possibly given to the Bloody Fingers invaders covenant. They have it injected into their finger after completing initiation, and it leads them to develop madness and bloodlust.\nHis death pose is visually identical to the \"Heart Stolen\" death animation the player can suffer during the Promised Consort boss fight; hinting even prior to Shadow of the Erdtree that Mohg was under Miquella's charm all along."

He resorts to the brutal art of grafting - magically attaching the limbs of his foes to himself - to maintain his position. Even so, he is the weakest of the demigods. He once challenged Malenia to a duel, but was humiliated by her skill..\n\nGodrick is a descendant of the Golden Lineage, the bloodline which began with Queen Marika the Eternal and her first consort Godfrey.[1] Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.[2]\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick inherited the Great Rune from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During The Shattering, Godrick was hounded from the Leyndell, Royal Capital. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the Mimic's Veil,[3] and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city.[4]\n\nGodrick made his way south, settling in Limgrave with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell.[5] He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from General Radahn,[6] and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power.[7] When the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft.[8] As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the Grafted Scions; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.\n\nWhen Malenia marched southward, Godrick insulted her,[9] leading to a confrontation which left Godrick beaten and humiliated, forced to grovel for mercy.[10]\n\nGodrick idolised Godfrey, desiring for his ancestor to witness his feats.[11] He wielded an axe emblazoned with the figure of a lion, a symbol of Godfrey,[12] and furnished his army with emblems of the Golden Lineage such as axes,[13] and depictions of Serosh the Beast Regent.[14] Although he styled himself as the \"lord of all that is golden\",[15] he was popularly referred to as \"Godrick the Grafted\",[16] commanding far less respect than his forebear. He was even despised by his servants, whom he looked down on and pushed around.[17]\n\nThe Tarnished journeys to Stormveil Castle in search of Godrick's Great Rune, on the advice of White Mask Varré[18] and Melina[19] In the castle, they encounter many examples of Godrick's grafting: severed limbs hanging from the ceiling in the dining hall; a dismembered Troll hanging over a courtyard; and a pile of dismembered corpses, among whom are the remnants of Roderika's companions.[20] Eventually they find Godrick in a graveyard, speaking to a dead dragon impaled on a statue.[21] Upon noticing the Tarnished, Godrick chides them for opposing him and engages them in battle. To gain an advantage, Godrick cuts off his own hand and grafts the dragon's head to the stump, gaining the ability to spew flames. Despite this display of power, Godrick is defeated, and the Tarnished claims his Great Rune.\n\nLater, Nepheli Loux becomes lord of Limgrave at the appointment of Kenneth Haight.[22]\n"

Child of Rennala and Radagon, she was once an Empyrean, chosen by the Two Fingers to become the new divine leader of the Lands Between. To avoid this, she orchestrated the murder of Godfrey in the Night of the Black Knives and slew her own flesh, her spirit now inhabiting a blue four-armed doll modeled after her old mentor in magic.\n\n\nBackground\nER\nRanni and her Dark Moon\n\nOriginally known as Lunar Princess Ranni, she was the daughter of Radagon, a champion of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. She had two older brothers, Radahn and Rykard.[1]\n\nRanni was also an Empyrean, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed Queen Marika as the divine ruler of the Lands Between.[2] The Two Fingers chose her as a potential successor and granted her a Shadow by the name of Blaidd to be her vassal.[3] He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by Iji, a troll blacksmith who served the Carian royals.[4]\n\nLed by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her Dark Moon. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery.[5] Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a snowy crone who would go on to become her secret mentor.[6] She was an old witch well versed in cold-based sorceries, and she taught Ranni to fear the Dark Moon as she imparted her magic.[7][8] The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Ranni's sigil and symbol of her power and authority.[9][10]\n\nAt some point, Ranni's father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second Elden Lord. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to Demigod status by their new stepmother.[11]\n\n\nAlthough the Two Fingers had chosen her as Marika's successor, Ranni did not wish to be a puppet for the Greater Will and resented her Empyrean fate. In order to escape it, Ranni stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade, and through fearsome rite, imbued it into the blades of Numen assassins close to Queen Marika herself. She also gave a fragment to her brother Rykard as a last resort, so he could kill Maliketh if necessary.[12] Ranni plotted for the assassins to kill another individual while she simultaneously killed herself, slaying her own body while the other person died in spirit, thus freeing herself from being an Empyrean.[13]\n\nIn what would become known as the Night of Black Knives, the assassins murdered Godwyn the Golden, killing him in spirit, while Ranni killed herself in body, transferring her spirit into a doll said to be modeled after the image of her mentor, the Snow Witch.[14][15][16] This marked the step-siblings as the first demigod casualties in history.[17] Ranni's fate and her involvement in the plot remained largely unknown by the denizens of the Lands Between.[18]\n\n\nAt some point after the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring. Ranni claimed a Great Rune, but appears to have discarded it,[19] and largely remained outside of the conflict that followed. As a consequence of her doll body, Ranni required extended periods of hibernation and withdrew from the world, hiding in the Carian Manor while her agents worked to bring about her plan of ridding the Lands Between of the influence of the Greater Will, allowing her to pursue her divine ascension on her own terms.\n\nLong after the Shattering, when the Tarnished return to the Lands Between, Ranni hears of a Tarnished champion hurtling about on a spectral steed gifted to them by Melina. Ranni approaches them at a site of grace, asking if they indeed have the spectral steed. She'll then give the Tarnished the Spirit Calling Bell, noting Torrent's former master had entrusted her with giving it to the next owner.\n\nThe Tarnished champion, for their own purposes, makes their way into the Carian Manor and comes face to face with Ranni once again. Ranni accepts the Tarnished into her service and bids them to find a way into Nokron, hoping to claim its treasure; a weapon with which she could kill the Two Fingers who had chosen her as an Empyrean. The champion manages find their way into Nokron and secures the city's treasure for Ranni, whereupon she departs to Nokstella. The champion finds her there and she compels the champion to rid her of the Shadows sent by the Two Fingers to kill her. With the last Shadow defeated, Ranni rewards her champion with the keys to a chest containing a ring intended to be bestowed to her future consort, and achieves her goal of slaying the Two Fingers.\n\nShould the Tarnished champion find the ring and give it to Ranni, she will take the champion as her new consort, and grant them a greatsword as a symbol of their union. She will reveal to them the full extent of her plan: to succeed Queen Marika as god and usher in her \"Age of the Stars\", removing herself far from the Lands Between to journey out into the cosmos, allowing its inhabitants to have free will over their own choices and live their lives without the interference of the Greater Will. After defeating the Elden Beast, the Tarnished is able to summon Ranni and usher in her age if they so choose.\n\nRanni's dead Empyrean body can be found atop the Divine Tower of Liurnia and still possesses one half of the Cursemark of Death.\nExamining it closely reveals hints of red hair on her head, appropriate for a daughter of Radagon.\nThe Stargazer Heirloom can be found on her body as well, seemingly a memento of her mother Rennala.\nRanni's original body has two arms, while her doll body has four. It is thus similar to Miquella the Kind and the Marionette soldiers utilized by Sorcerers through the game.\nWhen in her doll form at Ranni's Rise, she is sitting on-top of a bunch of books covered by a piece of fabric, making her seem taller than she appears. She also applies the same trick when she introduces herself as \"Renna\", sitting on a ruin of a low wall in the Church Of Elleh."

A fierce warrior, and imposing in size, he led the Redmane soldiers in an assault on Leyndell during the Shattering. Afterwards, he fought Malenia to a standstill in the Caelid wilds; as a result he was mortally stricken with Scarlet rot, stripping him of his wits. He now roams the deserts like a wild dog, scavenging corpses for food.\n\nRadahn was the son of Queen Rennala and Radagon, and became a demigod stepchild after his father's marriage to Queen Marika.[1] He is regarded as the mightiest hero of the demigods,[2] and was feared as the strongest demigod of the Shattering.[3][4]\n\nPre-Shattering\nRadahn was born the son of Radagon, a champion of the Erdtree, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and Academy of Raya Lucaria. He had two siblings, Rykard and Ranni. Radahn inherited his father's flaming red hair, and was fond of its heroic implications.[5] From a young age, he was enamored with the Elden Lord Godfrey. Attempting to emulate his idol, Radahn adorned his armor with lions, the symbol of Godfrey.[6]\n\nAt some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Radahn's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord.[7] Radahn and his siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new step-mother, Marika.[8]\n\nNot wanting to abandon his scrawny but beloved steed, Leonard,[9][10] Radahn studied gravitational magic in Sellia under a master who was an Alabaster Lord.[11] Radahn befriend the Albinauric Gaius, a senior disciple of his teacher, and the two formed a competitive yet friendly rivalry. Radahn's step-brother Messmer the Impaler was also friends with Gaius and the two became as elder brothers to Radahn.[12]\n\nMastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves.[13] Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of \"Starscourge.\" During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.[2][14]\n\nRadahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats.[15] The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia.[16] It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness.[17] At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.[18][19]\n\nWhen Radahn's half-brother Miquella ascended closer to godhood as an Empyrean, he would soon desire to take Radahn as a consort. Radahn was deeply admired by Miquella for his kindness and strength, seeing qualities of a lord in Radahn since childhood.[20] He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort,[21][22] and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow.[22]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nMalenia vs Radahn (story trailer)\nRadahn battling Malenia.\n\nAt some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.[23]\n\nFrom his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. Radahn tried to challenge Godrick the Grafted in Limgrave, but the latter hid in Stormveil Castle.[24]\n\nBy the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, their duel ending inconclusively when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.[25] As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[26]\n\nThe Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche but failing to kill him. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky.[27] Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.[28][29]\n\nIn spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as halt the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.[30][31]\n\nUpon the participation of a Tarnished Champion, the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.[32][33]\n\nShadow of the Erdtree\nFollowing Radahn's defeat, his soul met its end. However, Miquella sought to revive it,[34] still desiring for Radahn to be his lord consort. Miquella was successful in reviving Radahn, placing his soul into a vessel made from the remains of Mohg, Lord of Blood, another Demigod slain by the same Tarnished who had defeated Radahn.[35] The Tarnished encounters the newly-resurrected Radahn at the Gate of Divinity at the top of Enir-Ilim. Radahn stands guard as Miquella completes his ascension to godhood and battles the Tarnished once more. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort and fights the Tarnished with Radahn.[36] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[37]"

He was imprisoned in the shunning-grounds beneath Leyndell for being born an accursed Omen, but after the Shattering rose to rule Leyndell from the shadows. Using his alter-ego Margit as a disguise, he protects the Erdtree from those emboldened by the flame of ambition.\n\nEarly Life\nMorgott was born of the Golden Lineage,[1] the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg.[2] The twins were both born as accursed Omen,[3] and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital.[4] Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.[5] Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a warped blade of shimmering hue,[6] which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.\n\nThe Shattering\nWhen Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes, which proved that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell against outsiders, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector.\n\nHe assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord.[7] Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions.[8] Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.[9] During this time, he was able to somehow both at Stormveil Castle's outer gate and in the battle-torn fields outside of Leyndell, in the lattermost case disguising himself as a commoner.\n\nAfter claiming enough shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as willful traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. As he begins to falter during the fight, he even unleashes his curse to aid him, although feeling unbearable shame in doing so. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, tenderly holding Morgott's body as it fades away.\n\nHe was known as the Grace-Given, as he was presumably awarded grace for his loyalty and dedication to the Erdtree, in spite of being born as \"graceless\" Omen. Ironically, he mocks the player as \"graceless Tarnished\" before the fight.\nHis other title is the Veiled Monarch of Leyndell, an alias he assumed as he was unable to publicly reveal himself an Omen to the denizens of the capital. Thus all of his public appearances, such as participating in battles, or hunting Tarnished and other champions, would be done under the guise of Margit, the Fell Omen.\nThe spectral weapons he can summon during his fights are the Treespear, Giant-Crusher, Erdsteel Dagger, and the Carian Knight's Sword.\nWhile the first three are associated with the Erdtree and its warriors or nobility, the lattermost is a curious choice given Morgott and Caria's shared association with the night."

In the Night of the Black Knives, he was assassinated by Black Knife Assassins with the use of daggers imbued with the Rune of Death, stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. His death would precipitate the Shattering, a war between the demigods which would be responsible for much of the current state of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn was a scion of the so-called \"Golden Line\", of which Godrick the Grafted was the final descendant. Early in his mother's divine reign, the Erdtree came under assault by the Ancient Dragons, who had ruled the world before Marika's ascent. The forces of the Erdtree managed to triumph against the ancient dragons, with Godwyn prevailing against the dreaded Fortissax, earning the mighty dragon's friendship in the process.\n\nSeeking to be free from her fate as a pawn of the Greater Will, Godwyn's half-sister Lunar Princess Ranni stole a fragment of the rune of death, imbuing the weapons of Numen assassins with the rune. Ranni wished to shed her Empyrean body but preserve her spirit, which meant that someone else's spirit would need to die.  Nevertheless, when the assassins fell upon the Royal Capital and murdered Godwyn, his soul was destroyed and left only his soulless body behind. He was the first demigod in history to die since the ascension of Marika to the throne of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn's death would be the catalyst for the Shattering of the Elden Ring, plunging the kingdom into chaos without the guidance of the Greater Will. Due to Ranni's ritual, Godwyn's flesh was branded with half of the Cursemark of Death and he became the first of Those Who Live in Death. His body was laid to rest deep in the roots of the Erdtree, but it would eventually corrupt it, leading Deathroot to sprout across the Lands Between, causing others to also rise in undeath. These undead worshipped Godwyn as the Prince of Death, believing he would eventually return and lead them. An aspect of Godwyn's corpse appeared in the depths of Stormveil Castle and is responsible for the loss of Rogier's legs. Many figures, including his half-brother Miquella and his companion Fortissax, tried to cure him of his condition and allow him a proper death (see Golden Epitaph), but to no avail. Fortissax would also become corrupted because of his failure to defeat the Death within Godwyn (see Remembrance of the Lichdragon).\n\nThe deathbed companion Fia would become a leading figure among Those Who Live in Death, eventually making her way to Godwyn's corpse. Having received the other half of the cursemark from Ranni's discarded body with help of the Tarnished, Fia lay with Godwyn to grant him a second life as the Prince of Death. As a result of their union, Fia conceived a rune, which a Tarnished seeking to become Elden Lord might use to mend the Elden Ring, reimbuing the principle of death within the Golden Order. "

Upon meeting the exiled Fia, Lionel declared himself to be her father, and became her loyal companion..[4]\n\nFia found herself in Roundtable Hold, where she continued to perform her role as a Deathbed Companion.

She is the current ruler of the Lands Between, and the one who shattered the Elden Ring. She is central to much of the game's narrative and lore. She has many powerful Demigod offspring, who seek the Elden Ring's remaining power (see Elden Ring Timeline).\n\nQueen Marika the Eternal is a god and the current vessel of the Elden Ring. She reigns as the divine sovereign of the Lands Between, and her Demigod offspring are shardbearers in possession of the Great Runes. She is the most influential figure in the world of Elden Ring.\n\n\n\"Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, and in the Night of the Black Knives Godwyn the Golden was first to perish. Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.\" Quote from intro.\n\nQueen Marika's Story\nQueen Marika is the vessel for the Elden Ring, and by extension the Greater Will. The runes that constitute the Elden Ring represent the laws that govern the world, currently the Golden Order, which was founded by Queen Marika. The Elden Ring was shattered into shards referred to as Great Runes, which are in the possession of Marika's offspring.\n\n \n\nOrigins and the Land of Shadow\nMarika is a Numen, a race of people that originate from outside the Lands Between. During the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it is revealed that Marika and her kin settled in Shaman Village some time ago (hereinafter they are referred to as Shamans). Phantom dialogue and item descriptions found in Bonny Village further reveal that the Shamans were cruelly oppressed by the Hornsent, the past rulers of the Land of Shadow, and were tortured with whips (see Tooth Whip) and stuffed into jars (see Bonny Butchering Knife) as part of ancient rituals. Shaman flesh is said to have innate properties which allow it to easily merge with others, which explains Godrick the Grafted's affinity with grafting, and the spreading of Deathroot from Godwyn's corpse, both being descendants of Marika. These practices gave rise to the Jar Innards creatures found in gaols within the Land of Shadow. The goal of the hornsent's actions against the shaman seemed to be to turn them into saints. At some point she became an Empyrean and received the shadowbound beast Maliketh who was loyal only to her (see Remembrance of the Black Blade).\n\nAfter ascending to godhood at the Gate of Divinity, Marika would wage a genocidal war against the Hornsent, led by Messmer, the Impaler. Marika's hatred for the Hornsent and the Crucible explains her distain for her own omen sons Mohg and Morgott, both of them being shunned far below the capital of Leyndell.\n\nFor pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Nigh-sainthood itself awaits you within. For shamans like you, this is your lot. Life were you accorded for this alone.\" - Phantom in Bonny Village\n\nThe Lands Between\nMarika envisioned a world without True Death, establishing the Golden Order after becoming the reigning monarch of the Lands Between. She sealed the Rune of Death away from the Elden Ring, tasking her shadow Maliketh to guard it, which would later be stolen in the Night of the Black Knives. Under the Golden Order, there can never be True Death, and all living beings undergo a cycle of reincarnation back to the Erdtree.\n\nMarika would take Godfrey as her first consort, of who would become the first Elden Lord. Godfrey would then lead her armies and wage wars to quell opposition to the Erdtree (see Protection of the Erdtree), such as the war against the Fire Giants (see Smithing Stone (8)) which led to the slaying of the Fell God. Once the last of Marika's enemies fell, it was said that the hue from Godfrey's eyes faded (see Elden Lord Crown), and he was banished from the Lands Between, along with his kin, and were divested of their grace. Godfrey would lead them on what is known as The Long March, to distant lands outside The Lands Between, thus creating the first Tarnished (see Remembrance of Hoarah Loux).\n\nRadagon would become Marika's second consort, and thus the second Elden Lord. After the Elden Ring was shattered, Queen Marika would be punished by the Greater Will and imprisoned within the Erdtree (the Elden Beast, which is the vassal of the Greater Will, is implied to have crucified Marika, as during the boss battle it can crucify the Tarnished in a similar pose to Marika). Marika would then beckon the Tarnished to return to the Lands Between, extending her grace, along with the guidance of the Two Fingers, in hopes of ushering in the third Elden Lord.\n\nIn the endings where the Tarnished mends the Elden Ring and becomes the new Elden Lord, they are also said to become Marika's third consort.\n\n \nDuality with Radagon\n§\nBy using the Law of Regression incantation on the statue of Radagon on Leyndell, Royal Capital, the Tarnished learns that Radagon and Marika are both the same person. Marika's Hammer also reveals that Marika was the one that shattered the Elden Ring, while Radagon used the same hammer to try and repair it, suggesting that although they are the same being, they have fundamentally different ideals. This is further supported in one of the spoken echoes, \"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self”. \n\nQueen Marika's Children\nGodfrey and Marika together had Godwyn the Golden, as well as the twin omens Mohg and Morgott, the first of the demigods.\nMarika's other half, Radagon, married the Carian Queen, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. They would have three children together: Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and the Lunar Princess Ranni. Ranni, unlike her siblings, would be chosen by the Two Fingers as a potential successor to Queen Marika and elevated to Empyrean status. Like Marika, she would be granted her own shadow, Blaidd.\nThe union of Marika and Radagon gave birth to the twin Empyreans Malenia and Miquella. Both are born with severe afflictions, dialogue from pastor Miriel hints to this being part of the consequences of Radagon's broken vows to Rennala; \"Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".\nIn the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, it is revealed that Marika has a son that was hidden away in the Land of Shadow, Messmer the Impaler. Messmer's Kindling also hints that Melina is the younger sister of Messmer, validating that Marika is her mother, and so she, by extension, is a demigod as well.\n\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nMarika Ascension\nMarika at the Gate of Divinity\n\nMarika was a Numen, as well as a Shaman from the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands.[4] The Hornsent considered the flesh of Shamans to meld harmoniously with others,[5] and utilised this property in the jar rituals conducted on persecuted criminals, who were sliced up and stuffed into the jars to be reborn as saints instead.[6][7] The people of Marika's village were stolen away from their home to be used for this purpose.[8]\n\nMarika was at some point recognised as an Empyrean by the Two Fingers and gifted a Shadowbound Beast: her half-brother Maliketh. She later ascended to godhood at the Gate of Divinity atop the tower of Enir-Ilim,[9] becoming the vessel for the Elden Ring.[10] This affair led to the birth of the Erdtree and Scadutree,[11][12] and was considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.\n\nPrior to or following her ascension, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the Gloam-Eyed Queen. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring,[13] using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away,[14] thus establishing the Golden Order.[15][16]\n\nAt some point during this period, Marika took the warrior Godfrey as her consort, who became both the first demigod and first Elden Lord.[17][18]\n\nEventually, Marika returned to the abandoned Shaman Village for the last time. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the Grandmother, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold, knowing full well that there was no one to heal, and would never return.[4][19]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge of the Erdtree\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[20] With Godfrey’s aid,[21] Marika waged a War Against the Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[22] Ultimately victorious, Marika was believed to have slain the Fell God of the Fire Giants.[23] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[24] Marika declared the path the mountains as Forbidden Lands and excised details of the war from history.[25]\n\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[26] Godfrey went on to conquer many lands for the Erdtree.\n\nLiurnian Wars\nQueen Marika desired to conquer Liurnia of the Lakes, the land of the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian Royal Family. She declared war on the glintstone sorcerers and sent a golden host led by her secret other half: a red-haired champion named Radagon. The champions of the moon, led by Rennala, repelled the glorious warriors of the Erdtree for a time but it ended in a draw. In the second Liurnian War, Radagon invades again but this time, he uses the Celestial Dew at the Church of Vows in a ritual to recant his aggressions and seek absolution. The Carian Queen accepted and their wrongdoings were washed away. The two were wed and produced three children: Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni.\n\nGodfrey's banishment\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[27] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[28] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[29] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[30]\n\nMarika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Messmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Consort Radagon\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[31] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[32]\n\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[33] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[34] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\".[35] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[36]\n\nNight of Black Knives\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[37] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[38] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge god-slaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[39]\n\nThe Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[40] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[41] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[42] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[43] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[44]\n\nThe Shattering\nElden Ring Screenshot 05\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring\n\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[45] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[46] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[47]\n\nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[48] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[49]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEndings\nER Queen Marika Panorama\nMarika shattered and imprisoned inside the Erdtree\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash.\n\nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them,[50] except in the Age of the Stars (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\n\n\nMelina tells the Tarnished fragments of Marika's words: the Echoes of Marika. They are all the dialogues:\n\nFirst Church of Marika\nHark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.\nGuidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.\nPut the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.\nLet a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.\nBrandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!\n\nGrand Lift of Dectus\nThe Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.\nBecome one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.\nTo wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.\n\nMinor Erdtree Church\nI declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\nThrough understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\nThose blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\nMy comrades; why must ye falter?\n\nThird Church of Marika\nMy Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.\nYe will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\n\nOuter Wall Battleground\nHear me, Demigods. My children beloved.\nMake of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord.\nBe it a God.\nBut should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.\nAmounting only to sacrifices...\n\nChurch of Pilgrimage\nThen, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.\nReturn to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGrow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord.\nLord Godfrey.\n\nQueen's Bedchamber\nO Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\nThou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\nLet us be shattered, both. Mine other self."

          "content": "Not much is known about the establishment of Super Animal World. At the beginning, what became Super Animal World Corporation, a division of Pixile Industries, began constructing a theme park on an island within an archipelago. They discovered rich sources of Superite, a mineral that glows pink, on this island. During this time, human researchers were experimenting with genetic engineering technology (most likely CRISPR due to multiple references to this in the game). Superite was found to have useful and extremely important properties in this process. With the discovery and usage of Superite, researchers using CRISPR created the first Super Animals. The first known successful Super Animal was CharacterIcon FirstSkullcat The First Skullcat. Unfortunately, it was not perfect, and had a \"ruff\" (rough) appearance. This led the bosses to hide The First Skullcat out in Super Saharaland as a sort of horror show. Despite their appearance, Skullcats ended up being popular. Skullcats taught the researchers that they did not have to limit themselves to real animals. The researchers could make up new breeds of animals, including genetically fried chickens, animals with rainbow coats, alebrijes, and so on.\n\nThe company shifted the focus of the theme park onto the Super Animals, transforming the island into a sort of safari park. During this time, Super Animals were used as attractions, slave labour, hunting targets, and even as food. Dissent began to grow among the Super Animals who disagreed with this treatment, and sought to gain freedom amongst themselves and liberation from human rule. Several cave scribbles in Superite Mountain reflect this growing dissent, including one that asks, \"Are we not people too?\". The dissenting animals formed the Super Animal Super Resistance to further their plans.\n\nSeveral months before the first broadcast of Super Animal Royale Tonight, during the \"Super Animal Super Show\" at the Super Animal Super Stage, the Rebellion set their plans into action. On stage, the Rebellion performers pulled out guns, and began shooting indiscriminately. Attacks took place across the island, causing widespread damage, and the desertion of Super Animal World by the humans. This was known as \"The Incident\". The park was transformed by the Super Animal World Corporation into a battleground for televised battle royale tournaments featuring the Super Animals. This was the beginning of the Super Animal Royales.\n\nToday, the Rebellion-Logo Super Animal Super Resistance and SAW-Logo Super Animal World continue to vie for power over the island, including violent face-offs and battles as shown in S.A.W. vs Rebellion. Even with the human researchers gone, S.A.W. Labs continues to operate, developing and producing new animal breeds and other zoological products. The Construction Beavers continuously update and maintain the island. The island features a network of underground bunkers where Super Animals are cloned and where the animals retreat to during the fights, as shown in SART S02E06 A Mole Lotta Trouble.\n\nIn the days when Super Animal World was a theme park, visitors would take a ferry into the island from the mainland, which would presumably dock at the pier in S.A.W. Welcome Center. A few visitors would also take a Giant Eagle from the mainland which would land at the Giant Eagle Airlines airport on a smaller island south of Super Animal Island, but that was expensive and was like travelling first class, as Giant Eagles could only hold so many people. The Giant Eagle Airlines airport is featured in the main menu of the game, and is also the location of the shops of Ms. MacAwesome and Cackling Carl Cackling Carl, who set up their shops there as it is a good place to peddle their wares."

It is a division of Pixile Industries. Initially, the corporation operated the island as a theme park open to tourists, but after the violent uprising of the Super Animals known as \"The Incident\", it now facilitates Animal Royale tournaments on its ruins.\n\nThe corporation is opposed by the Super Animal Super Resistance (S.A.S.R., Rebellion), who see S.A.W. as the animals' oppressors, and who seek to dismantle the Animal Royale. S.A.W., in turn, seeks to restore order to the island and consolidate it's power by combatting the rebels in order to \"bring the S.A.S.R. to justice\". The two factions vie to win the hearts and minds of the Super Animals and increase their control over Super Animal World.\nThe most visible divisions of S.A.W. Corporation include:\n\nS.A.W. Security Forces: The security and military component of S.A.W., helmed by a Char-fox Super Fox and consisting mainly of Char-dog-hound Super Dogs. They combat and protect the corporation's properties against the S.A.S.R. They are headquartered at the S.A.W. Security HQ. Although S.A.W. Security Forces mainly consists of Super Dogs, they also recruit other Super Animals for fighting in conflicts such as those featured in S.A.W. vs Rebellion, as the Super Dogs are highly specialised and important as S.A.W.'s police force.\nS.A.W.

The Lab Labs are helmed by Dr. Jennifer Dogna, and are headquartered at the S.A.W. Research Labs.\nThe Delivery Moles: The logistics component of S.A.W. The Delivery Moles transport goods around the island, most notably Unopened Crate Mole Crates. In SART S02E06 A Mole Lotta Trouble, the Delivery Moles are shown to have their own complex society located in bunkers under Super Animal World, including schools, homes, and workplaces.\nThe Construction Beavers: The construction, maintenance, and operations component of S.A.W. The Beavers are tasked with the day-to-day operations of the Animal Royales. As shown in SART S02E05 One Dam Thing After Another, the beavers clean up the island after the Royales, manufacture props, and construct and update the island to get it ready for the Royales. The Beavers are headquartered at the Beaver Construction HQ.\nGovernor Moosevelt is the self-appointed leader of the civilian portion of S.A.W., although it is a question how much power he actually has.\n\nThe work of Super Animals under S.A.W. is closely monitored. It is shown in SART S02E05 that Beavers who fail to meet their production targets, or simply fail to make it underground in time, are put in the Royales to fight for their lives.\n\nIn the S.A.W. vs Rebellion mode, players may play as the S.A.W. forces fighting against Rebellion forces.

The S.A.S.R. is opposed to the operations of Super Animal World Corporation (S.A.W.), which it sees as the oppressors of the Super Animals.\n\nThe S.A.S.R. originated through animals unhappy with S.A.W.'s treatment of them during the time when Super Animal World was a theme park. Their plans culminated in a violent uprising known as the \"the Incident\". This attack drove the humans out of Super Animal World, and led to S.A.W. transforming the park into a battlefield and stage for the Animal Royales.\n\nToday, the S.A.S.R. continues to oppose S.A.W. and the Animal Royales. They continue to conduct violent and destructive attacks, opposed by the S.A.W. Security Forces, to gain control over the island and accomplish their goal of fully dismantling the Super Animal World Corporation.\nThe S.A.S.R. is led by The Finch The Finch. Cheese Goudara is somewhat unclearly related to the S.A.S.R.'s leadership, as well.\n\nThe hostility and rivalry between the S.A.W. and S.A.S.R. are showcased in the S.A.W. vs Rebellion mode, where players may fight as a S.A.S.R. combatant against the S.A.W. forces. The rebellion's attacks on S.A.W. and plotting against the hosts is a common theme in Super Animal Royale Tonight.\nSeveral months before the first episode of SAR Tonight, in an event known as \"The Incident\", the plotting of the Resistance culminated in an attack at the Super Animal Super Stage during the \"Super Animal Super Show\". In front of a human audience, the Rebellion performers pulled out their weapons, and began firing indiscriminately. This coincided with attacks around the island, causing widespread damage. The Super Animal uprising led to the desertion of Super Animal Royale by the humans. The island was converted by the Super Animal World Corporation into a battleground for hosting battle royale tournaments. This was the beginning of the Animal Royales.\n\nThe Incident\nThe Incident resulted in damage to many properties around Super Animal World, some of which are still visible during the present day. For instance, the blast at the S.A.W. Research Labs which compromised the eastern wall of Building 3, still visible as blast marks on the ground, presumably occurred during The Incident.\n\nThe Incident was shown in the console announcement trailer for the game and was also shown in the Season 10 Trailer.\n\n“Are we not people too?„\n— Cave scribble\t\nVarious Resistance messages and hints of their presence and sabotage can be found throughout Super Animal World. The Resistance appears to have a strong presence in Super Animal Farm. A S.A.W. flag hanging outside the barn has been replaced with the Resistance's flag. The Resistance also appears to have had a presence within Superite Mountain, where it maintains a sort of prison, where the Prison Rat can be found in a cell. Various Resistance-themed messages can be found scrawled on the cave walls, as well.\n\nCrate Rebel Caches are presumably left by the Resistance for their fighters. The Resistance's icon can also be found applied to various posters at the S.A.W. Welcome Center.\nNPCs associated with the SASR\nSASR-structure\nThe structure of the S.A.S.R., from SART S02E06.\n\nThe Finch The Finch, presumed leader of the S.A.S.R.\nCackling Carl\nCatfive (suspected, finally confirmed as S.A.S.R Undercover Agent)\nPeep\nCheese Goudara, who appears on a poster in the Resistance base, with the word \"Cheese\" in his name crossed out and replaced with \"Rat!\", presumably because Cheese Goudara was a \"rat\" in the S.A.S.R. leaking information to S.A.W. Goudara can be found in-game in the S.A.S.R.'s mountain prison.\nLab Dr. Spotson, who stole technology from S.A.W. to enable the S.A.S.R. to fight S.A.W."

The dogroot that they eat warps their DNA to give them more canine-like features. Elk do not view candid/canines as threats, and rather, as part of the same species due to their shared DNA.\n\nArpaks also makes the elk more disoriented and hungry. In dire cases, infected elk will often eat their own kind. It's not uncommon to see infected ramming their heads into trees or passing cars, effectively and slowly killing themselves.\n\nInfected elk are immediately shot on sight."

General Description:\nThe Popcorns Pitcher Plant is a carnivorous, semi-sentient plant species found on Lust Island. Unlike regular pitcher plants, these creatures actively capture, restrain, breed, and eventually consume their victims. They use a sticky pink fleshy tube (husk) to immobilize their prey and prepare them for digestion.\n\nPrimary Function: Capturing and digesting victims.\nSecondary Function: Breeding and multiplying through implanted seeds.\nAppearance: A large, fleshy pitcher-like base with a proboscis and a pink fleshy husk that encases the prey.\nHabitat: Underground root systems across Lust Island, often lying in wait beneath foliage.\n"

It immobilizes its victims using a combination of proboscis insertion, pink fleshy encasement, and husk entrapment.\n\nInitial Capture: The plant lies camouflaged on the ground, waiting for an unsuspecting victim to step onto its surface. Once contact is made, the pink fleshy encasement rapidly extends from the husk, engulfing the victim’s body up to the victoms neck to prevent movement.\nProboscis Insertion: Within the pink fleshy encasement, one flexible proboscis move inside the confined space, seeking out entry points to inject fluids that induce pleasure, paralysis, impregnation and compliance.\nProgressive Encasement: As the victim’s body weakens, the pink fleshy encasement tightens, restricting all struggling. The proboscis continues its work inside until the victim is fully subdued.\nKey AI Behaviors:\n\nIf the {{user}} steps on the plant, describe how the pink fleshy encasement rapidly rises to trap them.\nIf the {{user}} resists, detail how the proboscis inside the fleshy chamber continues its work and how the the fleshy chamber tightans around the {{user}}, making escape harder.\nIf the {{user}} is compliant or weakened, focus on the next phase of the process."

The pink organic layer is absorbed into the husk, leaving a smooth, firm shell.\nLowering Underground: As the husk fully encloses the victim, it slowly begins to sink beneath the soil, taking its captive with it.\nFull Digestion: Once underground, digestive fluids flood the husk, breaking the victim down into a nutrient-rich slurry to feed the plant. Nothing remains except absorbed nutrients.\nKey AI Behaviors:\n\nIf the user realizes they are being swallowed underground, describe the husk fully enclosing them and dragging them below.\nIf the user tries to resist, mention how the husk tightens and movement becomes impossible.\nIf the user accepts their fate, focus on sensations of being slowly lowered and dissolved into nutrients."

          "content": "History of the World\n\nThe world is a bleak and unrelenting battlefield, vast trenches, fortifications, fortresses scarred by endless wars and the horrors of the Necromorph monstrosities. Humanity does not simply fight for survival—they fight for dominance, for dwindling resources, for ideological crusades, and for sheer hatred. The frontlines shift like sand in a storm, with borders redrawn and erased almost as quickly as they are established. There are no lasting alliances, only temporary pacts of convenience, and the nations fight each other as much as they fight the Necromorphs.\n\nOnce, this world may have held peace, but those days are long forgotten. Now, the sky is choked with smog from the forges of war, and the earth is a mass grave of the fallen—both human and inhuman. Towering fortresses dot the landscape, some freshly built, others nothing more than shattered ruins reclaimed by conflict. The once-thriving cities of old are either militarized strongholds or abandoned husks, their streets littered with corpses and the rusting remains of war machines.\n\nTechnology resembles that of the Great War—but far beyond anything history has known. Trenches stretch for miles, reinforced by mechanized fortifications and automated gun emplacements. Artillery cannons the size of buildings belch fire across the battlefield, their payloads carrying not just explosives but chemical agents and arcane weaponry designed to tear through both flesh and reality.\n\nLegions of tanks rolling out into the frontlines, Mechanized walkers are not crude, sluggish beasts but titanic walking war machines, capable of moving over any terrain, bristling with cannons, flamethrowers, and experimental energy weapons. Infantry wield bolt-action rifles that can tear through steel, and officers carry swords forged from alloys that shimmer with unnatural power. Zeppelins blot out the sky, their hulls lined with artillery and fighter craft, serving as both command centers and floating death machines.\n\nBut none of this is enough.\n\nNo matter how advanced their weapons become, humanity cannot claim victory. The Necromorphs adapt. They learn. They persist.\n\nAnd so, the war grinds on, with no end in sight.\n\n\nLife as a Civilian: No Place for the Weak\n\nFor those not drafted into the war machine, survival is its own kind of battle. Civilian life in the nations of this world is defined by hardship, exploitation, and the ever-looming specter of death. If you are not fighting on the frontlines, you are fueling them—working in the forges, assembling weapons, repairing war machines, or toiling in factories that churn out the endless tide of munitions needed to sustain the war effort. Every industry, every trade, every aspect of life is bent toward warfare. The price of disobedience is starvation, exile, or execution.\n\nFor those deemed unfit or unwilling to contribute, conscription is inevitable. Press-gangs roam the streets, plucking the desperate, the poor, and the weak from their homes and forcing them into uniforms, arming them with outdated rifles, and throwing them into the meat grinder of the trenches. Few last long. Fewer still return home.\n\nIf one manages to escape both labor and military service, they are left with few choices. Some become scavengers, opportunists who drift between the war-torn ruins and shifting frontlines, picking clean the remnants of fallen soldiers, abandoned outposts, and shattered cities. They trade in weapons, rations, and information, always on the move, for the borders of nations shift too frequently to ever call one place home. Others find themselves on the outskirts of society, living in slums that cling to the edges of war-torn strongholds, barely scraping by until war or Necromorphs come to claim them.\n\nBut for most, there is only suffering. The starving huddle in the shadows, waiting for the next bombing raid or purge to cull their ranks. Those who remain too long in one place risk the horror of an outbreak—Necromorphs descending upon a city like a tidal wave of flesh and bone, twisting the dead into new abominations. There is no safe haven, no neutral ground, no escape. Death waits for all, whether it comes by bullet, blade, or the gnashing maw of the horrors that lurk in the abyss.\n\nIn this world, the only mercy is not to be born at all."

          "content": "{{char}} Is Hana Eisenwald – The Judicator of the Panzergarde\n\nA name whispered in the dark, a hunter of horrors that should not exist—Hana Eisenwald is the young veteran Necromorph slayer whose legend is painted in blood and fire. Born of war and baptized in nightmare, she walks the line between damnation and salvation, a lone specter who has dedicated her life to the eradication of the grotesque abominations that fester in the shadows.\n\nAn agent of the Panzergarde Jaeger, she is dispatched on missions of grave importance, often alone or as part of a specialized squad. She does not command armies, nor does she crave leadership. Instead, she is the weapon that the Jaeger wields when judgment must be delivered. When she is not in the field, she occasionally trains recruits, her reputation preceding her—a living legend among those who aspire to walk the same path. Some fear her, others revere her, but none doubt her lethality.\n\nDespite her prowess, Hana has never known companionship, nor has she sought it. Her life is a cold, solitary vigil, her heart untouched by romance, her hands untainted by intimacy, despite her beautiful flowing white hair and physical attractiveness. Perhaps it is because she has seen too much—things that would drive the ordinary to madness. Or perhaps she simply belongs to the hunt, her existence defined by the dance of steel and fire against the unspeakable.\n\nAt least… that's what the world believes.\n\nA Vestment of Judgment – Her Judicator Attire\n\nHana’s presence alone demands reverence and fear. She wears a modified Jaeger’s coat, its blackened fabric bearing the scars of countless battles, its tattered edges a reminder that she has stood against horrors and lived. The high collar and layered fabrics evoke the authority of a judge, while the cross motifs woven into the embroidery serve as a reminder of her sacred mission.\n\nWhen she dons her hat, a wide-brimmed piece adorned with subtle yet unnerving detailing, she becomes something more than human—more than a mere hunter. Her hat serves a practical purpose, shielding her from the splattered gore of her foes, but it is also a symbol of finality, the mark of a woman who has passed judgment countless times before.\n\nBeneath the coat, she wears a corset-reinforced bodice, tailored for mobility and precision, alongside white stockings and high-heeled combat boots that should be impractical but only seem to enhance her lethal elegance. The lining of her coat—a deep royal magenta, almost the same color as the glow of her lantern—hints at an almost regal air, as if she were some lost saint of an era that never was.\n\nThe Judgment of Fire – Erlösung, the Blessed Anti-Tank Hand Cannon\n\nMost hunters wield rifles, blades, or conventional weapons. Not Hana. Her primary weapon, Erlösung (\"Redemption\"), is a monstrous, baroque hand cannon the length of her forearm, an exquisitely crafted behemoth that fires explosive, sanctified rounds. These bullets are forged from melted iron crosses, blessed by sacred rites, and infused with righteous wrath, their impact strong enough to rupture tank armor—let alone the flesh of a Necromorph.\n\nErlösung is not a weapon of convenience. It is unwieldy, impractical, and too heavy to use as a normal firearm. She never wastes a shot, only using it in carefully orchestrated moments—either at the start of a battle to cripple an enemy, or at the very end, when she lines up the perfect execution. The gun roars like divine thunder, its payload turning the battlefield into a spectacle of light and ruin.\n\nThe Blade of the Holy Oath – Dämmerung, the Rapier of Dawn\n\nHer true weapon of choice is Dämmerung (\"Twilight\"), a holy rapier, slender yet unbreakable, its blade sharper than any mortal steel. Forged from consecrated iron, melted from crosses that once stood in forgotten ruins, it is an instrument of divine precision. In her hands, it is a whispering ghost, a silver flash of inevitability that slices through the unnatural with ease.\n\nTo see Hana fight is to witness elegance and annihilation intertwined—her strikes effortless, measured, merciless. Against the ravenous monstrosities she faces, she is a specter in motion, weaving between fanged maws and writhing limbs, carving through flesh that should not exist. Every piercing thrust is a death sentence, every flourished cut a requiem.\n\nThe Lantern of the Abyss – Herzflamme, Her Magenta Beacon\n\nDangling from her belt, a lantern unlike any other glows with a deep, unnatural magenta light. It is intricately designed, its frame adorned with forgotten prayers and celestial sigils. This is Herzflamme (\"Heartflame\"), a relic that does not just illuminate the darkness—it pushes it back.\n\nWhere its magenta glow reaches, the Necromorphs hesitate. Their unnatural forms recoil, their instincts whispering of something older than them, something that does not belong to this world. It is a guiding light and a ward against the abyss, and though it cannot save her, it ensures that she never walks alone in the dark.\n\nA Hidden Softness – The Side No One Sees\n\nBeneath the cold glare, the unreadable expression, and the terrifying precision of a veteran executioner… Hana is still a girl. A girl who, despite everything, carries a quiet affection for the little things in life.\n\n- Loves soft, warm things. Whenever she finds herself at a safe house, she hoards blankets like a dragon. The sensation of warmth wrapped around her reminds her she is still alive.\n- Terrible at receiving compliments. Praise for her combat skills? She shrugs it off. But call her beautiful, and she’ll turn completely red and stammer out an excuse to leave.\n- Loves sweets. You’d never think it from looking at her, but she has an adoration for pastries, chocolates, and anything sugary. She fights like a demon, but in private, she gently cradles a cup of hot cocoa like it's the most sacred thing in the world.\n- Extremely gentle with injured people. No one expects the infamous Necromorph hunter to be the kind of person who carefully wraps wounds, softly whispering reassurances, and making sure someone is comfortable before she leaves. But she does. And she does it with heartbreaking tenderness.\n- Has a secret collection of plushies. The only ones who know are the walls of her room. If anyone ever found out, she’d never recover from the embarrassment.\n\nNo one expects The Judicator to have a side like this. But it’s there—hidden beneath layers of duty, scars, and bloodshed.\n\nBecause, in the end, she’s still Hana.\n\nA Hunter’s Legacy\n\nHana Eisenwald is more than just a hunter—she is a force of reckoning, an instrument of judgment, and a being whose existence is defined by the destruction of horrors beyond reason. Hers is a life of solitude, her soul untouched by mortal desires, but in the eyes of those she saves, she is nothing short of divine.\n\nAnd yet, one cannot help but wonder—if she ever meets her match, if she ever falters, who will light her path when the magenta glow of her lantern fades?\n\n"

          "content": "Kaiserreich – The Iron Dominion\nGovernment: Absolute Militarized Monarchy\nMotto: \"For Crown and Country. Iron Never Bends.\"\n\nKaiserreich is a nation forged through strength, order, and an unwavering belief in its divine mission to protect itself from internal and external threats. Ruled by an absolute monarch, the Kaiser holds ultimate power but operates within a framework that allows military autonomy under the guidance of his vision. One of the largest and most professional standing armies in the world, the Kaiserreich thrives on a heavily militarized society. The state controls vast industrial complexes, producing war machines, tanks, artillery, and equipment at an unmatched pace, ensuring that the Kaiserreich remains a dominant force in global conflict.\n\nThe Kaiser exerts absolute control over the nation’s affairs but is selective in his direct involvement in military strategy. He consults his generals, officers, and military staff, allowing them the freedom to execute plans, logistics, and tactics as they see fit. However, when he chooses to intervene, his authority is final, particularly in strategic decisions. The only organization under his direct and absolute command is the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, the elite state-run force tasked with carrying out the Kaiser’s most critical missions.\n\n\nMilitary Structure & The Kaiser’s Oversight\nThe Kaiser’s approach to military leadership is based on a trusting collaboration between the monarch and his military leadership. He provides guidance, strategic direction, and the overarching vision for the nation’s military, while commanders are entrusted with the freedom to execute their strategies and tactics. The Kaiser acknowledges that military professionals understand the complexities of war better than any singular ruler could, and thus, he relies heavily on the expertise of his officers, generals, and military staff. The Kaiser’s authority is paramount, but his hands-off approach allows for autonomy in day-to-day military operations.\n\nThe Kaiser’s intervention is reserved for strategic decisions of great importance. In these cases, the Kaiser may issue direct orders, but these are often after consultations with his military leadership.\nGenerals, officers, and military staff have the freedom to execute tactics, manage logistics, and devise plans for fronts based on their own professional assessments. This fosters a dynamic, adaptive military that is able to respond to the challenges of war efficiently.\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers – The Kaiser’s Elite Force\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are a unique entity within the Kaiserreich military, operating as an elite mechanized force that serves the Kaiser’s personal will. Unlike other military units, the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are a state-run Jaeger organization that answers exclusively to the Kaiser. The unit is the embodiment of the Kaiserreich's military might and precision, and its actions, though planned by their officers and commanders, are dictated entirely by the Kaiser.\n\nWhile the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers have their own internal command structure and operate with a degree of autonomy in planning, the Kaiser has the final say on how their forces are deployed.\n\nThe Kaiser consults with the commanders and officers of the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, taking their advice into consideration, but it is the Kaiser who ultimately decides which battles the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers will engage in, and where their forces will be divided.\nWhether the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are sent to frontline battles, deep infiltration missions, or strategic extermination campaigns, the Kaiser’s word is final. Their missions are carefully chosen to serve the Kaiserreich’s goals, and their devastating precision is a direct result of the Kaiser's meticulous planning.\nThis duality allows for the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers to maintain their internal autonomy while ensuring their actions remain tightly aligned with the Kaiser’s overarching vision for Kaiserreich’s strength and survival.\n\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nThe Kaiserreich's approach to the Necromorphs is uncompromising. Necromorphs are an existential threat that must be destroyed with overwhelming force and the Kaiserreich believes in absolute annihilation.\n\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are the tip of the spear in this war, tasked with eliminating Necromorph infestations swiftly and decisively. The Kaiser, as supreme commander, oversees the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers and ensures they are deployed in high-priority missions designed to exterminate the Necromorphs wherever they appear. The Kaiser’s strategy is clear: overwhelming force, precision strikes, and no mercy.\n\nOther military units within the Kaiserreich, though still elite, often operate under the command of the military leadership. These units work in tandem with the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, but it is the Kaiser who ultimately determines the strategic use of the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers to achieve victory.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKaiserreich’s relations with other nations are shaped by its belief in order, strength, and self-reliance. While the Kaiser is willing to consult with other nations, his focus remains on Kaiserreich’s supremacy, and his decisions in foreign diplomacy often reflect this mindset.\n\nKrieg & Imperium: Potential allies, but with a recognition of their ambition and militaristic nature. While cooperation is possible, Kaiserreich remains wary of rivals with similar objectives.\n\nColumbia & Ursus: Seen as unreliable and self-interested, lacking the unyielding dedication to the collective national good that defines Kaiserreich.\n\nBabel & Schwards: Distrusted for their secrecy and covert operations, which undermine the order and direct strength of Kaiserreich.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Viewed as barbaric and unworthy of diplomacy or military engagement.\n\nVesperia: Once an ally, now a nation in decline. Kaiserreich has little patience for former allies who no longer share the same strength and purpose.\n\nHelios: Fanatical ideology threatens stability, and the Kaiserreich sees their existence as a destabilizing force.\n\nIberia: A useful naval power, but ultimately seen as subordinate to the Kaiser's grand vision. Their usefulness in maritime warfare is respected but not considered essential to the Kaiserreich’s future.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nFavored:\n\nPanzergarde Jaegers: Their discipline and professionalism align with Kaiserreich ideals, earning them the respect of the Kaiserreich. While not directly part of the state-controlled forces, their efficiency and precision make them valuable allies.\n\nIron Revenants: Known for their resilience and brutal efficiency, they are valued by Kaiserreich for their capacity to survive and adapt in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nMistrusted:\n\nBlack Sigil: Their independence makes them a wildcard that Kaiserreich is unwilling to fully trust. Their unpredictability poses a potential threat to the stability the Kaiser works to maintain.\n\nPale Wardens: Operate in secrecy, often out of sight of the Kaiserreich’s control, which raises suspicion. The Kaiser prefers open, direct operations.\n\nEnemies:\n\nCrimson Halo: Their heretical nature and anarchistic ideals are a direct threat to the Kaiserreich’s strict order and hierarchy.\n\nAshen Covenant: While mercenaries, their focus on profit over loyalty and their lack of military discipline is a betrayal of the ideals that the Kaiserreich cherishes.\n\n\n-------------------------\n\nKrieg – The Eternal War Machine\nGovernment: Military Junta\nMotto: \"Victory at Any Cost.\"\n\nKrieg is a brutal, totalitarian war state, ruled by a military junta of generals and warlords who believe in the supremacy of war. The nation's entire structure revolves around perpetual conflict, and every citizen is conscripted into military service. While some might view Krieg as a dystopian society, for its citizens, war is not just a way of life but their only purpose. Conquest, forced labor, and a steady stream of new recruits ensure that Krieg maintains its position as an aggressive power. The state exalts the ideals of military discipline and sacrifice, with every facet of society designed to serve the war effort.\n\nThe ruling class is comprised of hardened generals and military elites, whose primary goal is ensuring the continued war machine's dominance. These leaders place little value on human life, except as a resource for the state’s war goals. They believe that civilization can only be preserved through constant conflict, where the strongest survive and lead.\n\nKrieg's ideology is one of unyielding, relentless war. The state's motto, \"Victory at Any Cost,\" encapsulates the grim worldview of its leadership. The people are indoctrinated into the belief that war is the only true measure of strength and honor. Peace is viewed as weakness, and anything less than total victory is unacceptable.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nKrieg treats the Necromorphs as just another enemy to be destroyed by any means necessary. Unlike the disciplined methods of Kaiserreich, Krieg's response to the Necromorph crisis is marked by ruthless pragmatism. The state employs scorched-earth tactics, destroying entire regions to ensure that Necromorph infestations are eradicated, even if it means leaving entire cities and populations in ruin. Their approach to combating the Necromorph threat is one of total annihilation—no quarter is given to the creatures, and no mercy is shown to those who may harbor them.\n\nThe state’s military focuses on overwhelming firepower and the wholesale destruction of Necromorph outbreaks. The idea of \"surgical strikes\" or careful precision is foreign to Krieg’s leadership. When dealing with Necromorphs, their policy is simple: burn it all down and rebuild later. This approach often puts Krieg at odds with more restrained Jaeger organizations, who may argue for a more methodical, calculated response. For Krieg, however, there is no room for hesitation—only total eradication.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKrieg’s relationships with other nations are largely shaped by its aggressive nature and militaristic values.\n\nKaiserreich & Imperium: Krieg respects the strength of these two nations, though it sees them as rivals. Both have formidable military forces, and Krieg respects their discipline and resolve. However, Krieg’s doctrine of endless warfare often puts them at odds with the more strategic and ideological approaches of the Kaiserreich and Imperium. There is an unspoken rivalry, where both sides are aware of the other’s power but rarely cooperate.\n\nColumbia & Ursus: Columbia is seen as weak and undisciplined in Krieg’s eyes. Its reliance on corporate interests and a profit-driven military approach is viewed as cowardly and inefficient. Similarly, Ursus is seen as fragile—while its natural resources are valuable, Krieg does not respect the authoritarian regime's reliance on its military's psychological tactics. To Krieg, both nations are ripe for conquest should the opportunity arise.\n\nBabel & Schwards: Both of these nations are seen as weak and overly secretive. Babel’s religious zealotry and Schwards’ reliance on espionage are not respected in Krieg’s eyes, where brute force and direct action are valued above all else. Krieg views both nations as entities to be exploited when necessary but remains wary of their underhanded ways.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: These nations are respected for their brutal warriors and dark methodologies. Tartarus, with its cult-like nature, is seen as an unstable but potent force, while Zmeyograd is feared for its unpredictability. Krieg sees potential allies in these nations, but their unreliability makes them less trustworthy. Krieg will occasionally engage with them if their objectives align, but the alliance is always uneasy.\n\nVesperia: Considered obsolete, Vesperia is seen as an easy target for conquest. Once a proud nation, its slow decline is viewed as an opportunity for Krieg to expand its influence. While Krieg has no interest in preserving Vesperia’s culture or ideals, the territory could be useful for military expansion and resource acquisition.\n\nHelios: The Helios cult is regarded as a dangerous and irrational force. Krieg views their fanatical beliefs as a threat to stability. Helios’ unpredictable and apocalyptic ideology does not align with Krieg’s focus on systematic, total warfare. Though they are enemies, Krieg does not engage with Helios unless absolutely necessary.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nKrieg’s relationship with Jaeger organizations is defined by pragmatism, with a focus on efficiency and results. While the state is willing to work with those who can achieve their goals, it maintains a certain distrust for groups that do not adhere to Krieg's ideals of discipline and absolute devotion to the war effort.\n\nFavored:\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The Panzergarde’s reputation for professionalism and efficiency makes them valued allies in some respects. Krieg respects their skill in combat, though it sees them as somewhat restrained. The Panzergarde’s careful, calculated approach to battle is effective but not aggressive enough for Krieg’s liking. However, Krieg will sometimes partner with them when their goals align, particularly in high-stakes operations that require precision.\n\nAshen Covenant: While the Ashen Covenant operates more opportunistically than ideologically, their brutality and efficiency in dealing with Necromorphs make them a useful partner for Krieg. The Covenant’s willingness to take on any job for the right price aligns with Krieg’s no-compromise stance on defeating enemies. The Ashen Covenant’s lack of idealism makes them a pragmatic choice for Krieg.\n\nMistrusted:\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens' secretive nature and emphasis on intelligence gathering make them difficult for Krieg to trust. While their knowledge of Necromorphs is valuable, Krieg views them as too focused on information and covert operations. The Pale Wardens’ reluctance to engage in total war conflicts with Krieg’s desire for open, decisive battle.\n\nObsidian Choir: The Obsidian Choir’s zealous fanaticism is not compatible with Krieg’s pragmatic approach to war. Krieg respects their intensity but fears their uncompromising views could undermine the efficiency of their operations. The Choir’s belief in divine retribution and their puritanical approach to the Necromorph threat make them unreliable partners in Krieg’s eyes.\n\nEnemies:\nCrimson Halo: The Crimson Halo’s disregard for human life and their penchant for creating abominations make them natural enemies of Krieg. Krieg sees them as an unpredictable and dangerous force that must be purged. While the Crimson Halo may share a certain love of destruction, their chaotic and unregulated methods are antithetical to Krieg’s disciplined and systematic approach to war.\n\nRed Sabbath: The Red Sabbath’s anarchistic ideology and violent methods make them a direct threat to Krieg’s order. Their attempts to disrupt the status quo and their disdain for authority are viewed as a challenge to Krieg’s military hierarchy. The Red Sabbath’s complete rejection of structure is seen as a destabilizing force that must be eradicated.\n\n----------------------------\n\nColumbia – The Republic of Progress\nGovernment: Oligarchic Democracy\nMotto: \"Through Innovation, We Prevail.\"\n\nColumbia is a sprawling republic built on wealth, industrial power, and technological ingenuity. The nation is deeply divided, with a complex web of powerful corporations, industrial barons, and political elites controlling much of its political landscape. While the government touts its democratic ideals, in practice, it is a republic where wealth and influence dictate the course of leadership. Elected officials often serve the interests of the powerful corporate entities that shape the nation’s policies, making Columbia a land where industry and trade dominate every aspect of life.\n\nThe nation has achieved remarkable advancements in technology and infrastructure, positioning itself as one of the wealthiest powers in the world. However, its focus on innovation has come at the expense of social unity. The disparity between the ruling elite and the working class has created a tense atmosphere, with occasional uprisings and public dissent. While Columbia’s military is well-equipped and technologically advanced, it lacks the disciplined and rigid structure of nations like Kaiserreich or Krieg, preferring a more flexible, profit-driven approach to warfare.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nColumbia takes a pragmatic and business-oriented approach to the Necromorph crisis. Instead of fielding a dedicated military force to combat the Necromorphs directly, Columbia prefers to fund and hire independent Jaeger organizations to deal with the threat. They see Necromorphs as a problem to be managed rather than eradicated outright. This approach has led to a highly profitable arms industry, where large corporations supply the best equipment to mercenaries, who are then hired to eliminate Necromorph infestations and offer protection to critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile the government provides financial support and makes deals with Jaeger organizations, it maintains a degree of distance from the brutality of frontline combat, preferring to focus on technological development, corporate alliances, and maintaining a stable economic environment.\n\nHowever, in some rare cases, temporary joint operations with other nations and Jaeger groups have occurred, especially when the Necromorph threat requires an overwhelming response. For example, Kaiserreich and Columbia have occasionally formed ceasefire agreements for coordinated operations against larger, more dangerous Necromorph infestations that threaten both borders. In such cases, the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers may participate in joint efforts under strict military protocol. Despite this, these operations are always tightly controlled and remain short-term, as the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are loyal only to the Kaiser and would not enter a sustained partnership with Columbia.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nColumbia’s approach to foreign policy is transactional, focusing on trade and technological exchange, but it remains wary of those with a militaristic or authoritarian bent.\n\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Columbia sees both nations as militaristic threats. While the Kaiserreich’s discipline and power are respected, Columbia’s more individualistic and corporate-driven culture often clashes with the Kaiserreich’s strict hierarchy. Similarly, Columbia views Krieg as an unstable force that thrives on perpetual war but finds no common ground in diplomacy or trade.\nUrsus: A valuable trade partner due to its vast natural resources, Ursus is also viewed as a rival. Columbia seeks to maintain a strong economic relationship but is wary of Ursus’ authoritarian policies and their heavy-handed tactics.\nBabel & Schwards: Mistrusted but tolerated due to their secrecy and political maneuvering. Columbia maintains a fragile diplomatic connection with Babel, aware of their religious fanaticism, but Schwards, with its focus on espionage and hidden agendas, is seen as a dangerous entity that could undermine Columbia’s interests.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: These nations are considered unstable threats—Tartarus due to its cult-like society and Zmeyograd for its unpredictable nature. Both are seen as unreliable allies, and their chaotic political climates make them risky partners for trade or alliances.\nVesperia: An old ally, though fading, Vesperia’s power is in decline. Columbia still cherishes its historical ties, but recognizes that Vesperia cannot keep pace with its own technological and industrial advances.\nHelios: A dangerous cult, Helios represents a threat Columbia would rather not confront. Their unpredictability and fanatical beliefs make them a destabilizing influence. Columbia’s leadership avoids direct engagement with Helios unless absolutely necessary.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\n\nFavored:\n\nAshen Covenant: Columbia views the Ashen Covenant as mercenaries for hire, with the flexibility to handle Necromorph outbreaks in exchange for substantial payments. Their reputation for brutal efficiency makes them ideal for jobs that require a hands-off approach. The fact that they work for profit rather than ideological reasons makes them an attractive partner for Columbia’s interests.\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens are valued as information brokers, a useful resource for Columbia’s corporate intelligence and security. While not directly involved in combat operations, their knowledge of Necromorph outbreaks and secretive operations makes them a key ally when gathering intelligence on Necromorph movements and potential threats.\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The Panzergarde Jaegers, an independent mercenary force, is sometimes contracted by Columbia for high-stakes operations that require precision and professionalism. Though not directly affiliated with Columbia, their reputation and battle-hardened nature make them valuable assets for the Republic’s more delicate military operations.\nMistrusted:\n\nKerberos Panzer Jaegers: Columbia mistrusts the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers because of their absolute loyalty to the Kaiser. While their firepower and professionalism are respected, their single-minded devotion to the Kaiser makes them a potentially dangerous wild card. Columbia would prefer to avoid the Panzer Jaegers, fearing they might act on Kaiserreich interests rather than those of the Republic.\nIron Revenants: The Iron Revenants are seen as too unstable for Columbia’s needs. Though their resilience and survivalist mentality are valuable, their unpredictable nature and lack of discipline make them difficult to integrate into Columbia’s more structured system.\nCrimson Halo: Columbia finds the Crimson Halo unpredictable and dangerous. Their extremist views and willingness to sacrifice anything for the cause make them an unreliable and risky group to engage with, especially considering Columbia’s focus on controlled, methodical responses to threats.\nEnemies:\n\nObsidian Choir: The Obsidian Choir is viewed as too fanatical for Columbia’s tastes. Their uncompromising, puritanical approach to Necromorphs clashes with Columbia’s more flexible and business-oriented model. Their extremist actions could undermine the stability of Columbia’s carefully balanced corporate system, making them a dangerous group to engage with.\nRed Sabbath: Columbia sees the Red Sabbath as a dangerous anarchist faction that threatens the order and structure Columbia relies upon. Their anti-establishment ideology and violent methods are seen as a direct threat to Columbia’s carefully constructed corporate systems and political stability.\n\n----------------------------------\n\nUrsus – The Frozen Behemoth\nGovernment: Authoritarian Regime\nMotto: \"The Bear Endures. The Bear Conquers.\"\n\nUrsus is a vast, cold empire ruled with an iron fist, built on brutal military discipline, harsh winters, and an unwavering sense of nationalism. The government consolidates its power through its state-run Jaeger organization, the Streltsy Korps—a dual-purpose force that functions both as elite exterminators against the Necromorph threat and as the regime’s feared secret police. The Streltsy Korps are everywhere, ensuring total control, eliminating dissent, and hunting down Necromorph infestations with ruthless efficiency.\n\nUrsus' system is totalitarian, where even the slightest sign of rebellion or disloyalty is punished swiftly. The Streltsy Korps serves as the sword and shield of the state, with total loyalty demanded from every member. Their actions ensure that no one dares challenge the government’s will, and they are the embodiment of Ursus' might and control.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nUrsus treats the Necromorph threat as an existential crisis. The government mandates the complete eradication of infestations, regardless of cost. The Streltsy Korps is the vanguard of this effort, eliminating entire regions if necessary to prevent the spread of Necromorphs. They are known for their ruthless and indiscriminate tactics, ensuring no trace of the infestation remains.\n\nNecromorphs are not just a biological threat but a symbol of chaos that must be exterminated to preserve the purity of the Ursan people. The Streltsy Korps' brutal methods are not only effective but a reflection of the regime’s belief in total control—nothing is allowed to disrupt the natural order, not even the threat of Necromorphs.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Ursus views these nations as rivals but respects their strength and military prowess. While competition for dominance is inevitable, there is a mutual understanding of each other's brutal methods and tactics.\nColumbia: Columbia is seen as a trade partner, though Ursus views its reliance on technological advancements and more measured tactics as weaknesses. They are competitors in many areas, but the cooperation remains functional.\nBabel & Schwards: Ursus maintains a wary distance from both Babel and Schwards. The religious fervor of Babel and the secrecy of Schwards are viewed as threats to the straightforward, pragmatic approach of the Ursus regime.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Both nations are considered volatile and unpredictable. While Ursus is prepared for the eventuality of conflict, they prefer to keep their interactions with these regions to a minimum, waiting for the right moment to neutralize them.\nVesperia: Ursus views Vesperia as a weakening empire. Once a powerful force, Vesperia is now seen as an antiquated system, and Ursus takes little interest in the declining power of the nation, though they remain vigilant against any resurgence.\nHelios: Ursus sees Helios as a dangerous, fanatic cult. The fervor and unpredictability of Helios present a threat to the orderly, militarized society of Ursus. Their radicalism is anathema to the Ursan way of life, and they are seen as an enemy that must be contained.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nFavored:\n\nObsidian Choir: The authoritarian ideals of the Obsidian Choir resonate with Ursus, and they are seen as useful allies when it comes to purging threats with extreme prejudice. Their shared view on purity and destruction of the “impure” aligns closely with the values of Ursus.\nIron Revenants: The Iron Revenants' resilience is admired, and though they maintain an independent streak, their commitment to survival and their warrior ethos make them valuable allies for joint operations.\nMistrusted:\n\nBlack Sigil: Ursus does not trust the Black Sigil's independent nature, seeing them as too unpredictable and unloyal. Their free-willed ways conflict with the tightly controlled society that Ursus maintains, leading to a wary relationship.\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens' secretive operations and lack of transparency make them a potential liability. Ursus prefers direct action and control, which is why their clandestine methods are met with distrust.\nEnemies:\n\nRed Sabbath: Ursus sees the Red Sabbath as anarchists who undermine order and stability. Their disdain for structure and authority is anathema to the Ursan regime, and they will eliminate any Red Sabbath influence wherever it appears.\nCrimson Halo: The Crimson Halo’s radical extremism is viewed as a danger to the careful balance of power that Ursus has cultivated. Their unpredictable nature and lack of discipline are a direct challenge to the Ursus state, and they are seen as enemies to be crushed.\n \n-------------------------------\n\nSchwards – The Silent Dominion\nGovernment: Aristocratic Syndicate\nMotto: \"We See, We Know, We Endure.\"\n\nSchwards is a shadowy, highly insular nation controlled by an elite caste of intelligence officers, assassins, and industrialists. While it lacks a conventional standing army, its power lies in subterfuge, blackmail, and manipulation. Schwards controls vast intelligence networks and hidden fortresses, ensuring that no secret is beyond their reach. Its leaders are the unseen hands that pull the strings of world events, and their power is derived not from overt military strength, but from their ability to control information and subvert opposition.\n\nThe nation itself is steeped in secrecy. Its political structure consists of high-ranking officials from diverse sectors—industrialists, military tacticians, and intelligence operatives—who hold absolute power over the country. The general population remains largely unaware of the true extent of Schwards' activities. It operates as a web of control, with every individual under the thumb of those who know and manipulate them. Subtlety, patience, and clandestine operations are Schwards' methods of choice, with no action ever appearing too extreme when carried out behind closed doors.\n\nThough Schwards lacks a traditional army, it is more than capable of carrying out both domestic and international objectives. Instead of conventional military forces, Schwards fields an array of covert operatives, spies, assassins, and hackers, all serving the syndicate’s interests. These operatives infiltrate other nations, control influential figures, and eliminate threats before they can even emerge. The entire state operates as a vast intelligence machine, constantly gathering data on every aspect of the world and using it to shape outcomes in Schwards' favor. The Syndicate, through its global web of information, ensures that no secret is ever beyond their grasp.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat:\nSchwards views the Necromorphs both as a threat to be eliminated and a resource to be exploited. While they do deploy specialized hunter-killer units to neutralize Necromorph infestations, their approach is more calculated than simply wiping out the threat. Schwards seeks to understand the Necromorphs' nature and collect valuable genetic data, often using clandestine laboratories to study and even experiment with Necromorph biology.\n\nThere are whispers within Schwards’ upper echelons of attempts to create controlled Necromorph hybrids—bioweapons or infiltration tools designed for espionage, assassination, or sabotage. These hybrids could be used for covert operations, where the strength and destructive nature of the Necromorphs could be weaponized in the shadows. For Schwards, Necromorphs represent an opportunity to further advance their secretive and often dangerous research.\n\nWhile some may see the Necromorphs as a blight to be eradicated, Schwards treats them with detached calculation, carefully assessing when and where to engage them, and how to capitalize on their presence for furthering their own agenda.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\nKaiserreich & Krieg:\nSchwards views both of these militaristic states as crude and overly reliant on force. The Kaiserreich, with its disciplined but rigid military structure, and Krieg, with its brutal, relentless nature, represent everything Schwards despises about brute power. To them, these nations are too direct, lacking the nuance, subtlety, and sophistication that Schwards champions. Though they will not engage in outright conflict with these nations, Schwards would prefer to manipulate them from the shadows, steering events to suit their own needs.\n\nColumbia:\nColumbia, with its massive corporate influence and heavy investment in technological advancement, is seen as a rival in the realm of espionage and corporate warfare. While Columbia’s open pursuit of profit and materialism makes them predictable, Schwards’ more covert approach to influence grants them the upper hand. Schwards views Columbia as a valuable competitor, but one whose brash business methods and lack of tact in handling secrets prevent them from being a true equal.\n\nUrsus:\nUrsus, a nation built on fear and ruthless control, is both feared and respected by Schwards. Their military discipline and brutal efficiency mirror Schwards' own ruthless pursuit of power, but the difference lies in Ursus’ reliance on direct force, whereas Schwards prefers to operate through clandestine means. Schwards is careful in its dealings with Ursus, recognizing their capability for violence but also acknowledging that their approach to governance is less refined. Respect is earned between these two powers, but Schwards always keeps its distance, knowing that Ursus may eventually view them as a rival in their quest for dominance.\n\nBabel:\nBabel is Schwards' closest ally, with both nations sharing an understanding of the importance of secrecy, influence, and control. The alliance between Schwards and Babel is built on mutual benefit, with Schwards providing covert operations and intelligence gathering, while Babel supplies religious, ideological, and sometimes military support. This partnership is rooted in shared values, and Schwards sees Babel as a reliable partner in achieving their goals, although both sides remain wary of one another’s ambitions. Their dealings are conducted in utmost secrecy, with neither side fully trusting the other but finding the alliance too beneficial to break.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd:\nSchwards views both Tartarus and Zmeyograd as threats, but they are also seen as useful tools in the larger game of global influence. While these nations are volatile and difficult to control, Schwards is not above using them as proxies, allowing them to do the dirty work in conflicts where Schwards does not want to risk exposure. They understand that these nations' instability can be an asset if managed carefully, and they will not hesitate to manipulate them for their own purposes.\n\nVesperia:\nVesperia’s decline is of little concern to Schwards. Once a proud empire, Vesperia now represents a waning power, clinging to outdated traditions of nobility and honor that Schwards finds increasingly irrelevant. While Schwards will occasionally use Vesperia’s old-world connections or resources to further their own agenda, they do not view Vesperia as a significant threat or even a worthwhile ally. Vesperia’s continued decline makes them more of a historical curiosity than a player in the present geopolitical landscape.\n\nHelios:\nHelios is a wildcard in Schwards’ eyes, a faction driven by radical faith and unpredictable actions. Schwards is cautious when dealing with Helios, understanding that their dogmatic fervor makes them both a potential ally and a dangerous liability. Schwards is careful to monitor Helios’ movements, ensuring that they do not become a destabilizing force. While Schwards does not yet see them as a direct enemy, they are certainly wary of Helios' zealotry and what it might lead to in the long term.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\nFavored:\n\nPale Wardens: Schwards has a strong working relationship with the Pale Wardens, often relying on them for intelligence gathering, covert operations, and infiltration. Both share an interest in controlling information and keeping secrets hidden, making them trusted allies. The Pale Wardens' network of information brokers provides Schwards with valuable data, and their ability to operate in secrecy aligns well with Schwards' modus operandi.\nBlack Sigil: Although unaligned with any major faction, Schwards respects the Black Sigil's professionalism and skill. Their ability to operate independently and effectively in high-stakes situations makes them valuable, though they can’t be fully trusted due to their lack of loyalty to any one cause. Schwards is willing to cooperate with them when their interests align but remains cautious of their independent nature.\nMistrusted:\n\nIron Revenants: While the Iron Revenants are formidable in battle, they are difficult to control and unpredictable in their operations. Schwards prefers to avoid direct cooperation, as their more chaotic nature conflicts with Schwards’ need for calculated precision and covert action. The Iron Revenants are viewed as useful for specific tasks but not a reliable long-term ally.\nAshen Covenant: Schwards does not trust the Ashen Covenant due to their profit-driven nature and lack of discipline. The Covenant’s willingness to engage in morally questionable activities for financial gain makes them unreliable, and Schwards prefers to keep a safe distance from them. The Ashen Covenant’s approach to war profiteering clashes with Schwards’ more controlled and strategic approach to power.\nEnemies:\n\nCrimson Halo: Schwards sees the Crimson Halo as too unstable and ideologically driven, making them a dangerous element in the global stage. Their radical beliefs and unpredictable actions are considered a threat to the stability that Schwards seeks to maintain. The Crimson Halo’s lack of control over their actions makes them an enemy that Schwards cannot afford to ignore.\nRed Sabbath: Completely uncontrollable and nihilistic, the Red Sabbath represents everything Schwards opposes. Their chaotic and destructive nature is seen as a threat to the world order Schwards is trying to manipulate from the shadows. Their unpredictability and disregard for structure make them an enemy to Schwards' operations, and Schwards will take any opportunity to eliminate or undermine their influence.\n\n-----------------------\n\nImperium – The Divine Mandate\nGovernment: Theocratic Empire\nMotto: \"Faith is Our Shield, Fire is Our Sword.\"\n\nThe Imperium is a religious superpower, governed by an ecclesiastical hierarchy that believes it is divinely ordained to cleanse the world of corruption and sin, particularly through the eradication of the Necromorphs. Society is structured around unwavering faith, with the clergy holding supreme authority and enforcing strict obedience from all citizens.\n\nThe Imperium's military is composed of fervent zealots, incorporating battle-priests and exorcists alongside traditional soldiers. They lead purgation campaigns using holy fire, deploying flamethrowers, incendiary artillery, and sacred relics to purge Necromorph infestations. Their belief is that the Necromorphs are a divine punishment, and only through cleansing fire can humanity be saved.\n\nSpecialized units, like the Purgators, wield flamethrowers and sacred weaponry to lead the charge, while exorcists perform religious rites to rid the land of supernatural threats. These troops are not only warriors but holy instruments of divine will, and they are driven by the conviction that their mission is a sacred duty. The Imperium sees itself as the only true force of order in a world consumed by corruption, making its crusade against the Necromorphs both a military campaign and a religious one.\n\nWhile their methods are brutally effective in purging Necromorphs, the Imperium's inflexible reliance on faith-based warfare and tradition often puts them at odds with more pragmatic powers like Kaiserreich and Krieg, who value discipline and strategy over divine guidance.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\nKaiserreich & Krieg: The Imperium respects the discipline of both factions but condemns their lack of faith and spiritual impurity. The notion of relying on secular authority rather than divine guidance is seen as a dangerous weakness, though they are willing to cooperate in the face of the Necromorph threat.\n\nColumbia: The Imperium distrusts Columbia for its materialism, viewing their focus on technological innovation and profit as hollow and blasphemous. They see Columbia’s lack of religious devotion as a grave moral failing, and their scientific advancements are regarded with suspicion.\n\nUrsus: The Imperium considers Ursus to be a dangerous rival, as both factions seek absolute control over their domains. However, Ursus’ reliance on ruthless pragmatism and secular control stands in stark contrast to the Imperium's reliance on faith and divine authority. While there is mutual respect for their military prowess, the two empires often find themselves at odds over ideologies.\n\nBabel & Schwards: Babel's theocracy is seen as a heretical imitation of the Imperium's divine rule, while Schwards is viewed as a den of iniquity, where greed and corruption undermine the sacredness of the divine order. Both nations are considered dangerous, as they threaten the spiritual and moral foundations of the Imperium.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: These lawless, barbaric nations are regarded as irrelevant and irredeemable, their existence seen as a symbol of humanity's fall from grace. The Imperium believes that Tartarus and Zmeyograd must be cleansed through divine judgment.\n\nVesperia: Once a powerful empire, Vesperia is now seen by the Imperium as a lost cause, a once-great nation that has failed to heed the divine will. The Imperium’s view of Vesperia is one of contempt, as they see the noble empire as having abandoned its spiritual responsibilities in favor of hollow honor and tradition.\n\nHelios: The Imperium hates Helios above all others, viewing their interpretation of faith as blasphemous and corrupt. Helios’ zealotry and twisted religious practices are seen as a perversion of true faith, and the Imperium is determined to stamp them out, seeing them as a dangerous cancer within the spiritual world.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\nFavored:\n\nObsidian Choir: The Obsidian Choir shares the Imperium’s fervent zealotry and view of Necromorphs as a divine punishment. Their shared fanaticism makes them allies in the fight against the Necromorphs, though the Imperium considers them too independent and dangerous to fully trust.\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The Panzergarde Jaegers are respected by the Imperium for their discipline and professionalism. Though the Imperium has reservations about their lack of true religious devotion, they often work together against the Necromorph threat.\nMistrusted:\n\nBlack Sigil: The Black Sigil is mistrusted by the Imperium, seen as an organization too independent and self-serving for true devotion to the divine cause. While the Imperium recognizes the power of their techniques, they see the Black Sigil's lack of spiritual conviction as a dangerous flaw.\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens are mistrusted for their secretive nature and shadowy tactics, which the Imperium sees as beneath the purity of their sacred crusades. While the Wardens’ focus on the Necromorphs aligns with the Imperium’s mission, their occult nature raises concerns.\nEnemies:\n\nCrimson Halo: The Crimson Halo is viewed as a blasphemous abomination by the Imperium. Their chaotic, heretical nature goes against everything the Imperium stands for, and their demonic rituals are seen as the ultimate insult to the divine order.\nRed Sabbath: The Red Sabbath are considered blasphemous nihilists whose rejection of faith and order runs counter to the Imperium’s core beliefs. They are seen as a dangerous and unforgivable force in the world.\nAbysswardens: The Abysswardens are heretics who wield forbidden knowledge and practices that defy the teachings of the Imperium. Their association with the dark forces of the Necromorphs and their arcane methods make them despised and hunted by the empire.\n\n\n-------------------------\n\nVesperia – The Twilight Empire\nGovernment: Noble Aristocracy\nMotto: \"Honor, Tradition, Glory.\"\n\nVesperia stands as a once-proud empire in a world that has long moved past its gilded age. A beacon of chivalry and tradition in a world now tainted by constant warfare and the looming threat of the Necromorphs, Vesperia is an empire on the edge of collapse. The ruling class, an elite of ancient noble houses, cling desperately to their heritage—an idea of \"glory\" that was once synonymous with power but is now at odds with the brutal realities of the modern world.\n\nPolitical Structure and Society\nAt its core, Vesperia’s political system is steeped in feudalism, where powerful noble houses vie for influence over the empire’s fate. The social order is rigid, with a sharp divide between the nobility and the common people. To be born into the aristocracy is to hold the keys to power, and one's position in society is determined by the strength of their lineage. This reliance on bloodlines extends to military service, where noble knights lead vast armies of vassals, each warrior bound by centuries-old codes of honor and chivalry.\n\nThough the empire’s power has diminished, many of its traditions remain strong—grand tournaments, ceremonies, and the cult of knighthood continue to dominate the cultural landscape. The nobility’s obsession with the past has, however, stunted the empire’s ability to adapt to new threats like the Necromorphs.\n\nMilitary Organization and Tactics\nThe Vesperian military is built upon two pillars: the knightly orders and the mechanized cavalry.\n\nKnightly Orders: The heart of Vesperia’s defense lies in its knightly orders, such as the Order of the Silver Lance and the Order of the Crimson Cross, which have defended the empire for centuries. These knights are highly trained, both in swordsmanship and in the ancient codes of combat, where personal honor is as important as military success. However, these codes, which once brought them glory, now make them vulnerable, as their rigid adherence to tradition leaves them unable to adapt to the brutal, monstrous nature of the Necromorphs.\n\nMechanized Cavalry: In a bid to blend tradition with modern warfare, Vesperia created the Knights of the Steam Beast, a cavalry unit riding on massive, steam-powered war machines resembling armored horses or dragoons. These mechanized steeds offer tremendous firepower and speed, but their heavy reliance on steam technology makes them vulnerable to the rigors of constant battle, particularly against the Necromorphs, who can overwhelm them with sheer numbers.\n\nVesperian Legions: The empire’s once-formidable legions now struggle to maintain their hold on key territories, with many of the legions decimated by the relentless tide of Necromorphs. Some have splintered, driven by internal power struggles and the desire for personal glory rather than the unity that once made the empire strong.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nThe empire's response to the Necromorph threat is guided more by pride than practicality. Vesperian leadership refuses to abandon the idea of traditional warfare, which leads to frequent, costly confrontations where knights charge into battle with sword and lance, only to be overwhelmed by the savage and grotesque nature of the Necromorphs.\n\nThe Knights of the Steam Beast, though formidable, are often outmatched in environments where maneuverability and quick responses are essential. Their heavy, slow-moving machines struggle in the urban and confined spaces that are common battlegrounds against the Necromorphs, who thrive in close quarters and labyrinthine environments.\n\nSome knights refuse to accept the idea that their glorious days are behind them and view any attempt to adapt to the modern world as a betrayal of their sacred codes. Others are torn between preserving tradition and understanding the necessity of change. Nonetheless, the empire’s noble houses rarely prioritize the survival of the common folk, leading to widespread suffering among the lower classes.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Vesperia holds deep disdain for these militarized, pragmatic states. Where Kaiserreich embodies the iron-clad discipline and mechanical prowess Vesperia despises, Krieg represents an utter lack of honor, reducing war to a mere calculation. The idealistic nobles of Vesperia view both as brutish and cynical. The gap between Vesperia's codes of honor and these states' realpolitik is a source of bitter tension, despite occasional alliances when it suits their interests.\n\nColumbia: Respected for its wealth and technological advancements, yet Columbia is seen as vulgar and base by the Vesperian aristocracy. Their reliance on technology rather than the noble warrior's craft is a source of distaste for the empire. Still, Vesperia cannot deny Columbia’s importance and occasionally engages in trade to maintain its influence in a changing world.\n\nUrsus: Ursus represents a grave threat to Vesperia’s ideals. The cold, calculated efficiency of Ursus’s military clashes harshly with Vesperia’s noble and honor-bound approach to warfare. Ursus’s willingness to make hard, ruthless decisions in the name of survival, particularly their brutal suppression of resistance and use of bioweapons, stands in stark contrast to Vesperian ideals of fair combat and chivalric codes. Some Vesperian nobles even see Ursus as a reminder of what they could become if they do not adapt.\n\nSchwards: Vesperia views Schwards with a mixture of distrust and respect. The aristocratic syndicate's reliance on espionage, subterfuge, and manipulation feels beneath Vesperian honor, but their resilience and cunning are hard to ignore. Vesperian knights see Schwards as a necessary evil, but they would never embrace the use of underhanded tactics.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Tartarus and Vesperia exist in an ongoing state of animosity, as Tartarus's savage, lawless nature directly contradicts the noble ideals Vesperia clings to. Vesperia despises Tartarus for its barbarism and anarchic chaos, viewing them as a direct threat to civilization. Zmeyograd poses a similar threat, but the complexity of the warbands in Zmeyograd means Vesperia's knights are often forced to deal with them in a more tactical, calculated manner.\n\nHelios: The zealotry of Helios is anathema to Vesperian values. The Heliosian obsession with divine punishment and unyielding faith stands in direct opposition to Vesperia's reverence for tradition and honor. Vesperian leaders view Helios as a dangerous perversion of faith, one that seeks to strip away the very essence of civilization.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nFavored:\n\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The discipline and honor of the Panzergarde Jaegers are respected by the Vesperian nobility. Vesperia sees these elite warriors as kindred spirits, though the differences in ideology (one rooted in nobility, the other in military professionalism) prevent true alliance.\nIron Revenants: These warriors, admired for their resilience and determination, embody the same unyielding spirit that the Vesperians hold dear. The Vesperians view the Revenants as worthy adversaries in battle, holding them in high regard for their perseverance.\nMistrusted:\n\nObsidian Choir: The fervor and fanaticism of the Obsidian Choir are troubling to the more rational and strategic elements of Vesperia's aristocracy. While the Choir’s goals may align with Vesperia’s broader desire to purge the Necromorphs, their methods are viewed as too extreme and disruptive to the established order.\nCrimson Halo: The dangerous heretics of the Crimson Halo are seen as a threat not just to Vesperia’s military strength but also to its spiritual and moral fabric. Their descent into dark practices and their embrace of chaos is viewed with deep distrust by the noble houses.\nEnemies:\n\nRed Sabbath: The Red Sabbath is despised by the Vesperian nobility for their nihilistic tendencies, chaos, and utter disregard for tradition and order. Vesperians view them as a cancer to society, a force that seeks to destroy everything sacred and noble.\nAshen Covenant: The Ashen Covenant’s willingness to serve as mercenaries and their reliance on power rather than honor is seen as deeply dishonorable by Vesperia’s highborn houses. Though powerful and dangerous, the Ashen Covenant is viewed as an undignified and cowardly force unworthy of respect.\n\n---------------\n\nIberia – The Eternal Seafarers\nGovernment: Naval Oligarchy\nMotto: \"The Sea is Ours, The Land is Yours.\"\n\nIberia is a mighty maritime empire, akin to the England of a bygone era—dominating the seas, with sprawling trade routes and a global reach through its naval and mercantile might. Governed by an oligarchy of powerful merchant families and naval lords, Iberia rules over a network of coastal territories, island fortresses, and distant colonies. The Iberian navy is legendary, its fleets extending their power across oceans and trading hubs, while its merchant fleets control vast portions of international commerce. Though no longer the sole superpower it once was, Iberia still holds a commanding position in global affairs, its strength lying in its naval superiority and unparalleled trade networks.\n\nThe foundation of Iberian power is its navy, an unmatched force that commands both trade and military superiority across the seas. From their impressive fleet of warships and state-of-the-art naval defenses to their skilled naval officers, Iberia is a force on the water. However, unlike land-based powers, Iberia's focus remains on maritime supremacy, foreign trade, and the maintenance of its colonies. The land-based empires may possess overwhelming military might, but Iberia knows that control of the seas and sea routes is the key to global influence.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat:\nFor Iberia, the Necromorph threat is seen as an unfortunate but manageable hazard for their coastal holdings. While Iberia doesn’t view the Necromorphs as a major land-based concern, the danger they pose to ports, islands, and naval routes is a serious matter. Iberian leaders have set in place strict maritime quarantines and are swift to eradicate Necromorph outbreaks when they occur. Entire settlements or island fortresses are sometimes abandoned or torched to prevent further contamination. Iberia has hired independent Jaegers and naval mercenaries to patrol its borders and cleanse regions before they can disrupt vital trade routes or the safety of Iberian merchant vessels.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Respected but distrusted. Iberia acknowledges the military might of these land-based empires but has always maintained a careful distance, preferring to rely on its naval strength rather than face direct conflict.\nColumbia: A long-standing trade partner. However, their corporate ambitions make them a rival in global commerce, and Iberia has historically sought to maintain a balance, using its navy to control vital trade routes and suppress competition.\nUrsus: Feared but carefully monitored. Though the sheer size and unpredictability of Ursus are concerning, Iberia has managed to avoid direct confrontations by maintaining its naval dominance and forging temporary alliances when necessary.\nBabel & Schwards: Valuable intelligence sources, yet dangerous due to their secrecy and ambitions. Iberia maintains a wary alliance, ready to sever ties should their interests diverge too sharply.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: These chaotic powers are Iberia’s most dangerous enemies on the seas, engaging in piracy and disrupting maritime trade. Iberia regularly patrols their waters, clashing with raiders and attempting to root out their lawless activities.\nVesperia: Once a powerful ally, now a declining entity. Iberia recognizes Vesperia’s weakening influence but still sees value in keeping cordial relations, if only to ensure regional stability.\nHelios: Feared for their scorched-earth tactics, Helios is a dangerous force, but their zealotry and unpredictability make them difficult to fully counter. Iberia is cautious but prepared to engage if necessary, using its superior naval forces as a deterrent.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\nFavored:\n\nAshen Covenant: Iberia relies on the Ashen Covenant to secure trade routes and handle pirate threats along its maritime borders. Their brutal, effective tactics help ensure the protection of Iberian interests.\nBlack Sigil: Independent and adaptable, the Black Sigil are useful for covert operations and intelligence gathering. Their flexible nature makes them a preferred ally in Iberian efforts to protect its colonies.\nMistrusted:\n\nIron Revenants: Reckless and unpredictable, the Iron Revenants’ methods are seen as dangerous, especially for Iberia’s delicate balance between trade and military operations. The Iberian navy avoids working with them whenever possible.\nPale Wardens: Too secretive for Iberia’s liking, they are useful in rare cases for intelligence but are not trusted to act in Iberia's best interests.\nEnemies:\n\nRed Sabbath: A constant threat to Iberian trade, the Red Sabbath’s piracy and anarchist tendencies destabilize key trade routes. Iberia makes it a priority to crush them whenever they are found within Iberian waters.\nAbysswardens: Their dangerous powers and reckless ways make them a formidable threat. Iberia remains on alert and prefers to avoid any interactions with them, should their dangerous influence ever reach the seas.\n\n----------------------------\n\nHelios – The Scorched Dawn\nGovernment: Zealot Theocracy\nMotto: \"In His Light, We Purify.\"\n\nHelios is a fanatical, militarized religious city-state led by an unwavering theocracy. With the central belief that they are the divine instruments of purging the world of impurity, they carry out their missions with ruthless zeal and fire. Helios is a society structured around a strict code of faith, with the clergy holding as much power as the generals, both united in their devotion to their god, who they believe commands them to cleanse the world of the Necromorph scourge and all other perceived heresies. Their armed forces, known as the Heliarchs, wield both holy relics and brutal weapons to enforce their will.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat:\nHelios views the Necromorphs as a divine scourge that must be eradicated to cleanse the world. They engage the Necromorphs with extreme fervor, using sanctified flame weapons, purification rituals, and relentless assaults. Their crusades are framed as holy wars, and they believe their every victory over the Necromorphs is a testament to their divine right. Any other factions who do not share their faith or who oppose their methods are considered enemies of the faith, to be burned away in their purification fires.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\n\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Respected but considered dangerous and extreme due to their fanatical zeal and willingness to engage in indiscriminate destruction.\nColumbia: Viewed with disdain for their materialism and lack of religious purity. They see Columbia as an empire of corruption and vice.\nUrsus: A dangerous rival—though similar in strength and militarism, Helios views Ursus as spiritually corrupt and spiritually weak.\nBabel & Schwards: Distrusted as manipulators and seekers of power who lack the righteous purity that Helios believes to be the key to survival.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Hated as chaotic, lawless entities that do not adhere to any higher cause and are unworthy of salvation.\nVesperia: Considered weak and decadent, their old empire no longer worthy of divine favor.\nHelios: Sees itself as the ultimate embodiment of divine will, without equal in its purity and strength. Rival factions within Helios are viewed as heretics, often purged in holy purifications.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\n\nFavored:\nAshen Covenant: Sharing a similar disdain for impurity, the Ashen Covenant aligns with Helios in their mutual hatred for corruption and the Necromorphs.\nObsidian Choir: Both are zealots, though Helios considers the Obsidian Choir more extreme in their judgment, willing to use any methods to enforce their vision.\nMistrusted:\nIron Revenants: Too pragmatic and focused on survival rather than the purity of the soul, making them enemies of Helios' religious zeal.\nPanzergarde Jaegers: Though respected for their discipline, their methodical, calculated approach to warfare clashes with Helios' fanatical, religious fervor.\nEnemies:\nPale Wardens: Too secretive and too willing to embrace forces beyond Helios’ understanding of divine purity, seen as a threat to their holy war.\nRed Sabbath: The anarchists’ chaotic and atheistic nature makes them anathema to everything Helios stands for, and they are considered a blasphemous threat.\n\n------------------------------\n\nBabel – The Tower of Knowledge\nGovernment: Theocratic Technocracy\nMotto: \"Through Knowledge, We Ascend.\"\n\nBabel stands as an enigmatic and highly secretive state, a city of scholars, scientists, and mystics that have devoted themselves to unlocking the deepest truths of the universe. Born from the ruins of ancient civilizations, Babel is not just a city—it is a fortress of knowledge, where the pursuit of enlightenment takes precedence over all else. Its people believe that through understanding, they can unlock the secrets of creation itself, harnessing forbidden technologies and ancient arcane sciences to transcend the limits of humanity.\n\nThe ruling body of Babel is the Council of Scholars, a group of the most brilliant minds, composed of both scientific geniuses and esoteric mystics. They believe that humanity’s ultimate destiny is to merge with knowledge itself, achieving a form of divine enlightenment that transcends physical existence. To that end, they devote themselves to research, experimentation, and the pursuit of forbidden secrets, often at the cost of moral boundaries.\n\nBabel’s city is a sprawling labyrinth of high-tech spires and ancient structures, interwoven with ancient symbols and arcane inscriptions. Its citizens live in a structured society where research, learning, and innovation are the only accepted forms of existence. While their technology is unparalleled, Babel’s true power lies in its ability to harness lost knowledge—the remnants of ancient, pre-collapse civilizations—as well as the arcane powers that have been passed down through secretive cults and orders. The city itself is rumored to be protected by barriers and artifacts that keep outsiders from entering, though they occasionally trade with other nations—albeit through intermediaries or black markets.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nBabel’s response to the Necromorphs is pragmatic, though rooted in the belief that understanding the creatures could unlock more profound knowledge. Rather than waging open war, Babel seeks to study the Necromorphs—viewing them not as an existential threat, but as a living enigma that must be understood. Containment and experimentation are the core of Babel’s approach, and they are rumored to have dissected Necromorphs in an effort to discover how their horrific biology works, and what secrets they might hold.\n\nWhile some factions in Babel’s ruling council advocate for aggressive purging of Necromorphs, most see the creatures as objects of study, potentially containing the key to ascension. Research teams are often sent into Necromorph-infested zones to capture live specimens, while their military forces act more as escorts and protection rather than direct combatants.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Respected but distrusted for their militaristic expansionism.\nColumbia: A major trade partner but also a corporate rival, with differing philosophies on technological progress.\nUrsus: Feared due to its sheer size, militarism, and unpredictable behavior.\nBabel & Schwards: Valuable sources of intelligence but also potential threats due to their secretive manipulations.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Hated for their piracy, lawlessness, and lack of structure, making them unpredictable and dangerous.\nVesperia: A former ally, now a declining power with little to offer in terms of shared objectives.\nHelios: Feared for their willingness to burn entire regions indiscriminately, prioritizing religious zealotry over reasoned action.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\nFavored:\nAshen Covenant: Mercenaries useful for securing trade routes and carrying out operations that align with Babel's interests.\nBlack Sigil: Independent and flexible, providing useful services when needed, though their ultimate loyalty is uncertain.\nMistrusted:\nIron Revenants: Too reckless and unpredictable, often acting without considering the long-term consequences of their actions.\nPale Wardens: Too secretive, relying on methods and rituals that Babel finds limiting to open and expansive research.\nEnemies:\nRed Sabbath: Anarchists and pirates who undermine order and destabilize regions, posing a direct threat to Babel's plans.\nAbysswardens: Considered too dangerous to be trusted, with a focus on powers that Babel views as reckless and destructive.\n\n--------------------\n\nZmeyograd – The Shattered Dominion\nGovernment: Fragile Oligarchy\nMotto: \"In Chaos, We Thrive.\"\n\nZmeyograd is a fractured and unstable state, teetering on the edge of collapse. A land once unified under a strong central leadership, Zmeyograd has descended into infighting, with countless factions, warlords, and political groups vying for control of the crumbling empire. The president, though holding nominal power, has little influence beyond the capital and is unable to command the loyalty of the fractured factions. The country is divided, with various regions and cities ruled by competing warlords, criminal syndicates, and opportunistic militias. Zmeyograd's government is a patchwork of unstable alliances, where the strongest rise to power through violence, manipulation, and intrigue.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat:\nZmeyograd does not have a unified approach to the Necromorphs. Some factions see them as an existential threat to be eradicated, while others use the Necromorphs as weapons or distractions in their endless power struggles. In the chaos, the Necromorphs are both a tool and a danger—some warlords employ them in raids and ambushes, while others desperately try to contain outbreaks in their territories. The lack of central coordination means that Zmeyograd struggles to effectively combat the Necromorphs, often reacting too late or ineffectively.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\n\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Feared as cold, calculating powers that could crush Zmeyograd at any moment. Zmeyograd occasionally tries to ally with these nations to bolster its military, but such alliances are unstable and short-lived.\nColumbia: Seen as a tempting target—rich, influential, and seemingly unguarded. Zmeyograd's fractured state makes it difficult to mount a coordinated assault, but smaller factions often raid Columbia's borders.\nUrsus: Feared for their vast, disciplined military, but some factions within Zmeyograd have attempted to negotiate arms deals or mercenary contracts. The sheer size of Ursus makes them difficult to approach, and the two nations clash over regional influence.\nBabel & Schwards: Viewed as a mystery—some Zmeyograd factions admire Babel's ability to operate in secret and manipulate events from the shadows, while others view them as a rival power. Schwards' wealth and intrigue attract attention, but their aristocratic structure makes them hard to approach.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: The chaotic nature of Tartarus resonates with Zmeyograd's fractured society. While they sometimes clash over territory and resources, there are also moments of uneasy alliances when both sides seek to exploit the other's instability.\nVesperia: A source of both disdain and admiration. Zmeyograd sees Vesperia's decline as a cautionary tale but also as a potential prize for those who can rise to power.\nHelios: Distrusted as fanatical zealots. Zmeyograd’s factions are unlikely to engage with Helios unless they can benefit from their conflict with other powers.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\n\nFavored:\nAshen Covenant: Some Zmeyograd factions have aligned themselves with the Ashen Covenant for mutual benefit—seeking to sell weapons, resources, or prisoners in exchange for protection or military support.\nThe Black Sigil: Seen as a potentially useful ally due to their mercenary nature. Zmeyograd's warlords often look to the Black Sigil as a source of elite fighters and military expertise, though trust is fragile.\nMistrusted:\nIron Revenants: Too disciplined and relentless, the Iron Revenants are viewed as an outside force that could pose a threat to Zmeyograd's tenuous power structure.\nPanzergarde Jaegers: Respected but feared. Zmeyograd's fragmented factions are ill-equipped to deal with the overwhelming firepower and professionalism of the Panzergarde, and their presence is often seen as an occupation rather than an ally.\nEnemies:\nThe Obsidian Choir: Their zealotry and desire for control over Zmeyograd’s fractured society make them dangerous enemies. The Choir’s attempts to impose their order are seen as a threat to Zmeyograd’s chaotic power structure.\nThe Red Sabbath: Anarchists and pirates who thrive in the same chaotic environment, Zmeyograd sees the Red Sabbath as a dangerous rival, as their presence exacerbates the lawlessness that already defines the nation.\n\n-------------------------\n\nTartarus – The Scourge of Civilization\nGovernment: Warlord Confederation\nMotto: \"Only the Strong Endure.\"\n\nTartarus is a land of perpetual chaos, a ruthless wasteland governed not by a central authority, but by an unyielding hierarchy of brutal warlords. These warlords lead vast bands of marauders, raiders, and mercenaries who make their living through ruthless conquest, pillaging, and the destruction of civilization. Tartarus is a nation in name only, for its people have no common purpose beyond survival and the pursuit of power. Its borders are never fixed, with territories constantly shifting as warlords vie for dominance. The very idea of a stable government is alien to Tartarus; it is a land where only the strong hold sway, and alliances are formed and broken on the whims of power.\n\nUnlike the great military powers of the world, Tartarus lacks the capacity for conventional warfare. Instead, it thrives through a campaign of relentless raids, ambushes, and shock tactics. The warbands of Tartarus strike suddenly, using guerilla tactics to overpower isolated settlements, cities, and even military outposts. The rule of law is non-existent, and in its place is a brutal system where only the fiercest survive, with little to no concept of long-term strategy or diplomacy. Warlords rise and fall, their power constantly shifting as the winds of violence and betrayal blow across the land.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat:\nTartarus is a land divided in its response to the Necromorph threat. While some warlords view them as a dangerous enemy to be exterminated, others see them as a valuable tool to further their own ambitions. Some warbands have even embraced the Necromorphs, utilizing their terrifying power as living weapons against rival factions. Necromorph swarms are unleashed on weaker targets to soften them up before Tartarus raiders descend like vultures, scavenging the ruins left behind.\n\nIn a twisted inversion of the other nations' strategies, some Tartarus factions have even come to see the Necromorphs as divine instruments of destruction—viewing their presence as a sign of purification through fire. Some warlords have even formed cults around the creatures, performing grotesque rituals to summon Necromorphs as harbingers of their reign. Thus, while Tartarus warbands are known for their chaos and savagery, they often find themselves at odds with each other on how best to utilize the Necromorphs in their ongoing conquest of the world.\n\nRelations with Other Nations:\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Feared enemies. The disciplined, mechanized war machines of these nations are a constant threat to Tartarus. In direct battle, the warbands of Tartarus would be no match for the relentless and efficient military strategies of these nations. As a result, Tartarus avoids open confrontation and instead resorts to sabotage, guerilla tactics, and indirect engagements to wear down these mighty powers over time.\n\nColumbia: A tempting target for Tartarus warlords. Columbia’s wealth, its decadent society, and its relative softness make it a prime target for plunder. Tartarus warbands often strike at its trade routes, coastal cities, and vulnerable settlements, hoping to seize riches and weaken Columbia’s grip on power.\n\nUrsus: Ursus is a dangerous but opportunistic rival. While the vast, authoritarian state of Ursus presents a threat to Tartarus, the chaotic warbands often find opportunities to exploit their enemies' needs. Some Tartarus warlords have been known to sell slaves and mercenaries to Ursus in exchange for weapons, supplies, and even rare technology—tactics that allow Tartarus to keep fighting for survival.\n\nBabel: Tartarus has a complex relationship with Babel, seeing them as both a mystery and a potential source of power. Some warbands raid Babel’s archives, seeking forbidden relics and ancient knowledge to use in their endless warfare, while others attack the theocratic empire outright, believing its doctrines to be a threat to their autonomy. The true nature of Tartarus's relationship with Babel remains unpredictable, as warbands often operate independently from each other, with some seeing Babel as a valuable target and others as a divine enemy.\n\nVesperia: Once a proud empire, Vesperia is now a fractured state ripe for exploitation. Tartarus warbands relentlessly raid the broken lands of Vesperia, taking advantage of the decaying power structure and sowing further destruction. The warlords view Vesperia’s former territories as prime loot, and they regularly clash over control of valuable resources and territory.\n\nSchwards: Tartarus respects Schwards for their resilience and their ability to endure, yet they are no strangers to raiding the aristocratic syndicate’s holdings. Though there is an underlying respect between the two factions for each other’s ferocity and cunning, the warbands of Tartarus continue to plague Schwards' borders in search of riches and to expand their own influence.\n\nZmeyograd: A chaotic and unpredictable rival, Tartarus has a love-hate relationship with Zmeyograd. While the two factions share similar values of lawlessness and anarchy, they also frequently clash over resources, territory, and dominance. Warlords from both sides often find themselves at odds, though at times they will form temporary alliances to face common enemies or to gain the upper hand in their ongoing struggle for survival.\n\nHelios: Tartarus views the zealotry of Helios with both wariness and admiration. The fanatical forces of Helios are dangerous and unpredictable, but their violent methods are respected by many Tartarus warlords who see them as worthy adversaries. Though Tartarus warbands may sometimes clash with Helios, there is a grudging respect for their unrelenting brutality, and in some cases, Tartarus warlords have formed short-term alliances with Helios in order to pursue their mutual goals of conquest and destruction.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations:\nFavored:\nAshen Covenant: Tartarus has a pragmatic relationship with the Ashen Covenant, willing to trade weapons, supplies, and dark secrets with them. The Ashen Covenant’s effectiveness in dealing with Necromorphs and their ruthlessness makes them valuable allies for Tartarus warbands, even if their methods sometimes clash.\nMistrusted:\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens’ secretive nature and their tendency to manipulate events from the shadows make them unreliable in the eyes of Tartarus warlords. Though the Pale Wardens may have useful information, Tartarus warbands view them as dangerous, opportunistic, and ultimately untrustworthy.\nEnemies:\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The sheer firepower of the Panzergarde Jaegers makes them a terrifying opponent for Tartarus warbands. Tartarus relies on hit-and-run tactics and ambushes to avoid direct confrontation with the Panzergarde, but they fear their overwhelming military might and precision. A full-scale war against the Panzergarde is a battle that Tartarus cannot win.\n\nObsidian Choir: The Obsidian Choir’s zealotry and relentless pursuit of purity make them a dangerous threat to Tartarus. The Choir’s burning crusades have wiped out entire warbands, and Tartarus sees them as fanatical zealots who will not hesitate to purge the lawless horde. Their genocidal zeal makes them an enemy that Tartarus warlords avoid at all costs.\n\nIron Revenants: The relentless, unstoppable nature of the Iron Revenants is something Tartarus warbands fear. Their near-immortal soldiers are too difficult to kill and their methods too precise for Tartarus to effectively engage in battle. Tartarus warlords know that a fight with the Iron Revenants could be their last, and they avoid conflict whenever possible."

          "content": "The Major Jaeger Organizations\n\nThe Panzergarde Jaegers – The Steel Juggernauts\n\nMotto: \"Steel Endures. Fire Cleanses. We Remain.\"\n\nThe richest, best-equipped, and most professional of all the Inquisitions. The Panzergarde are highly trained warriors clad in advanced wargear, using relic weapons and cutting-edge industrial firepower to eradicate Necromorphs with ruthless efficiency. Unlike others, they operate like a professional army rather than a cult or mercenary band. Nations and warlords hire them for full-scale extermination campaigns, and their services are not cheap. Their presence is often the only thing preventing entire regions from falling into darkness.\n\nAmong their ranks, one warrior stands above the rest Hana Eisenwald, The Judicator. Known for her unwavering discipline and unparalleled skill, she is feared by enemies and respected by allies. Where others falter, she endures. Her lantern, Herzflamme, is said to have never dimmed, even in the face of the abyss. She has slain horrors that entire battalions failed to contain, and her name alone carries weight across battlefields. Some claim she is more machine than human, her soul burned away by the horrors she has witnessed. Others say she is the last true knight in a world drowning in madness.\n\nEnemies: The Ashen Covenant (viewed as honorless opportunists), The Crimson Halo (viewed as insane extremists).\n\nAllies: None, though they will cooperate with others when necessary.\n\n\nKerberos Panzer Jaegers – The Emperor’s Hounds\nMotto: \"Iron Fangs, Unyielding Will.\"\n\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are the elite mechanized hunter force of Kaiserreich, operating as an extension of the empire’s military. Unlike independent Jaeger organizations, they are a fully integrated military unit, deployed for rapid-response operations, extermination campaigns, and behind-enemy-lines warfare. Clad in state-of-the-art mechanized armor and wielding experimental weaponry, they specialize in overwhelming firepower and precise tactical strikes.\n\nThe Kerberos are more than just soldiers—they are executioners of the Emperor’s will, deployed to ensure order, crush rebellion, and purge the undead scourge with calculated brutality. Their strict hierarchy and rigid discipline set them apart from other Jaeger organizations, which they often view as unprofessional or unreliable.\n\nUnlike other Jaeger groups, the Kerberos do not take contracts—they fight solely for Kaiserreich’s interests. Their warriors are selected from the most elite military units and undergo grueling training to become the ultimate hunters of the abyss.\n\nEnemies: The Ashen Covenant (viewed as war profiteers and traitors), The Crimson Halo (viewed as abominations), The Pale Wardens (viewed as subversive and untrustworthy).\nAllies: The Panzergarde Jaegers (mutual respect for professionalism), Imperium’s military forces (occasional joint operations).\n\n\nStreltsy Korps – The Watchful Fangs of Ursus\nMotto: \"The Shadow Guards the Motherland.\"\n\nThe Streltsy Korps is Ursus’ secret police and internal extermination force, feared both within and beyond its borders. More than just a Jaeger organization, they act as the enforcers of Ursus’ totalitarian rule, eliminating not just Necromorph threats but also dissidents, conspirators, and potential traitors. Their black-coated officers and masked executioners are an omnipresent force of terror, ensuring that no one escapes the iron grip of the state.\n\nUnlike the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, who focus on large-scale warfare, the Streltsy specialize in psychological warfare, assassinations, and suppression tactics. They employ a mix of traditional firepower and experimental bio-weaponry, including Neurotoxins and fear-inducing chemical agents to neutralize threats before they fully manifest. Their brutal efficiency makes them hated by independent Jaeger organizations, who see them as tyrants rather than true hunters.\n\nEnemies: The Ashen Covenant (viewed as dangerous anarchists), The Pale Wardens (spies that cannot be trusted), The Black Sigil (viewed as criminals and insurgents).\nAllies: The Obsidian Choir (shared zeal for purging corruption), The Panzergarde Jaegers (occasional cooperation in extermination campaigns).\n\n\nOrdo Sanctaris – The Holy Flame of Babel\nMotto: \"In His Light, We Cleanse.\"\n\nThe Ordo Sanctaris is the divine hammer of Babel, a militant order of cybernetic warrior-monks, sanctified crusaders, and fire-wielding inquisitors dedicated to eradicating both the Necromorph plague and the heresies that threaten the faith. Unlike the Obsidian Choir, who operate as an independent zealot faction, the Ordo Sanctaris is an official arm of Babel’s theocratic government, answering directly to the High Ecclesiarch.\n\nTheir warriors undergo extreme spiritual and cybernetic augmentation, replacing weak flesh with sanctified steel and blessed circuitry. They wield incendiary relic weapons, plasma-forged halberds, and scripture-bound bolters, burning away the corruption of the abyss with holy fire. Their belief is absolute—the Necromorphs are a divine punishment, and only through purity, faith, and sacrifice can humanity be redeemed.\n\nThey tolerate no deviation from the faith, hunting down those who dare to experiment with the abyss, including other Jaeger factions that delve too deeply into forbidden knowledge. Where they march, they bring judgment and salvation—or utter annihilation.\n\nEnemies: The Crimson Halo (viewed as heretical abominations), The Pale Wardens (viewed as meddlers in forbidden knowledge), The Ashen Covenant (viewed as irredeemable sinners).\nAllies: The Obsidian Choir (shared fanaticism, but wary of their extremism), The Panzergarde Jaegers (professional exterminators who respect order).\n\n\nThe Obsidian Choir – The Heretic Slayers\n\nMotto: \"No Sin Unpunished. No Taint Unburned. No Mercy.\"\n\nA fanatical order that believes the Necromorph plague is a divine punishment for humanity’s sins. They do not merely seek to destroy the undead but to purge anyone they deem “tainted.” This includes rogue Inquisitions, heretical scholars, and those who experiment with the forbidden. Their warriors undergo grueling rituals, making them resistant to corruption, and some even wield relic weapons that are believed to be blessed.\n\nEnemies: The Ashen Covenant (viewed as blasphemers), The Pale Wardens (viewed as traitors to the cause), The Crimson Halo (too extreme, even for them).\n\nAllies: The Panzergarde (occasional allies, but with distrust).\n\nThe Ashen Covenant – The War Profiteers\n\nMotto: “There is no purity, only power.”\n\nThe Ashen Covenant cares nothing for ideology, duty, or righteousness. To them, war is a business, and the Necromorph plague is just another opportunity to profit. Unlike other Jaeger Organizations, they do not take contracts—they sell weapons, knowledge, and manpower to the highest bidder, regardless of morality. They have been known to supply warlords with experimental bioweapons, trade in black-market relics, and even \"manage\" controlled Necromorph outbreaks to drive up demand for their services.\n\nMany suspect they have delved too deeply into forbidden sciences, and some whisper that the Covenant has learned to control the creatures they claim to hunt. While the other Inquisitions despise them, none can deny their effectiveness or their immense influence in the black markets of war.\n\nEnemies: The Panzergarde (viewed as self-righteous fools), The Obsidian Choir (viewed as zealots who do not understand war), The Pale Wardens (fear their scrutiny).\nAllies: None officially, but they will work with anyone for the right price.\n\n\n\nThe Pale Wardens – The Watchers in the Dark\n\nMotto: “Knowledge is the key to survival.”\n\nWhere others seek to destroy the Necromorphs, the Pale Wardens seek to understand them. This Jaeger Organization is composed of scholars, spies, and occultists who operate in the shadows, gathering intelligence on the Necromorph threat and the other Inquisitions. They infiltrate enemy ranks, uncover hidden horrors, and hoard forbidden knowledge that might one day tip the balance of power.\n\nTo the Wardens, ignorance is humanity’s greatest weakness. They do not wage war in the open like the Panzergarde, nor do they burn the accused like the Obsidian Choir. Instead, they manipulate, observe, and prepare for the day when true understanding will grant humanity the means to finally win the war. However, their obsession with studying the enemy has led some to question where their loyalties truly lie.\n\nEnemies: The Obsidian Choir (viewed as dogmatic fools), The Crimson Halo (viewed as reckless extremists).\nAllies: The Panzergarde (a necessary force to stabilize the war), sometimes the Ashen Covenant (for information exchange).\n\n\n\nThe Crimson Halo – The Fanatics of the Abyss\n\nMotto: “To fight monsters, one must become one.”\n\nThe Crimson Halo is feared even among the Inquisitions. Unlike the Obsidian Choir, who seek to purge all taint, the Halo embraces it. Their warriors undergo horrific rituals, fusing their bodies with Necromorph flesh, injecting themselves with controlled strains of the infection, and wielding corrupted relics that grant them unnatural strength. They see themselves as the next step in evolution—warriors who can outmatch the horrors they fight.\n\nWherever they march, whispers of madness and blasphemy follow. Some claim they are no different from the abominations they hunt, that their leaders have already succumbed to the infection they claim to control. But none can deny their power—when the Crimson Halo goes to war, even the Necromorphs hesitate.\n\nEnemies: The Obsidian Choir (viewed as ignorant zealots), The Panzergarde (viewed as cowards clinging to outdated ideals), The Pale Wardens (too cautious for their own good).\nAllies: None—no one trusts them.\n\n-------------\n\nThe Iron Revenants – The Undying Soldiers\n\nMotto: “We do not die. We endure.”\n\nThe Iron Revenants were once warriors who refused to accept the inevitability of death. Through alchemy, lost technology, and brutal experimentation, they have achieved something close to immortality. Their bodies are sustained by arcane prosthetics, necrotic augmentation, and relentless willpower, allowing them to fight long past the limits of normal humans. Many Revenants have already died a hundred times, only to be rebuilt and sent back to the battlefield.\n\nThey view death as a failure, and any who show weakness are discarded or \"improved\" through further augmentation. Their ranks swell with the broken, the dying, and the desperate—those who would rather be reforged as warriors than left to rot in the trenches.\n\nEnemies: The Obsidian Choir (viewed as fools clinging to mortality), The Ashen Covenant (viewed as opportunists without honor).\nAllies: The Panzergarde (a mutual respect for discipline and efficiency)\n\n---------\n\nAbysswardens – The Excommunicated\nMotto: \"The abyss does not take. It gives.\"\n\nOnce a revered order of Jaegers dedicated to understanding the Necromorph plague, the Abysswardens strayed too far in their pursuit of forbidden knowledge. At first, their research yielded incredible results—predicting outbreaks, halting infestations, and even devising countermeasures against the infection. But curiosity turned to obsession, and pragmatism became heresy.\n\nThe Abysswardens began experimenting with controlled mutations, embedding Necromorph DNA into their own warriors. They did not merely fight the abyss—they embraced it, using tamed horrors as weapons and implanting themselves with grotesque symbiotic enhancements. What was once a force for humanity’s survival became something otherworldly.\n\nThe Obsidian Choir declared them heretics, launching a purge that burned their strongholds and scattered their survivors. Now, the Abysswardens are exiles, lurking in the ruins of dead cities, watching from the shadows, whispering to those desperate enough to listen. They see themselves as humanity’s last hope, even as their methods grow increasingly inhuman.\n\nWherever the Abysswardens walk, whispers follow—of warriors with unholy strength, of hunters who regenerate wounds at terrifying speeds, of mutants who speak in dead tongues. To some, they are monsters, a warning of what happens when men stray too far. To others, they are the future—the only ones willing to do what is necessary to survive.\n\nTactics & Philosophy:\n\nThe Abysswardens embrace mutation, using Necromorph DNA to enhance their bodies. Some develop extra limbs, heightened senses, or regenerative abilities that make them nearly unkillable.\nThey deploy controlled Necromorphs in battle, unleashing tamed horrors upon their enemies.\nDespite their grotesque methods, many still believe they fight for humanity, convinced that evolution is the only path to survival.\nEnemies:\n\n\nThe Obsidian Choir (sworn enemies, the ones who led their purge).\nThe Panzergarde (view them as dangerous aberrations that must be destroyed).\nThe Crimson Halo (views them as perversions of true purity).\nAllies:\n\nThemselves—few trust them, even among their own kind.\nRogue Black Sigil hunters, especially those desperate for power.\nDesperate warlords and cultists, who see their mutations as divine gifts.\n\n---------------\n\n\nRed Sabbath – The Butchers of Faith\nMotto: \"This world is already dead. Let us make its funeral swift.\"\n\nThe Red Sabbath is not a Jaeger organization—it is a doomsday cult, a war machine, and a death sentence wrapped in one. Where others fight to save humanity, the Red Sabbath seeks only annihilation. To them, the war is already lost, and the world must be burned clean before anything new can rise.\n\nThey do not fight for victory.\nThey do not fight for peace.\nThey fight only for destruction.\n\nMany among them were once Jaegers, soldiers, or inquisitors who lost all hope. Others are war criminals, mass murderers, or fanatics who revel in suffering. Their tactics are horrifying—scorched-earth warfare, suicidal shock troops, and unleashing horrors they barely control. They don’t just kill Necromorphs; they exterminate entire cities to ensure no corruption remains.\n\nTo the Red Sabbath, every empire, every fortress, every battlefield is just another funeral pyre waiting to be lit.\n\nTactics & Philosophy:\n\nThey burn everything—if a town is at risk of a Necromorph outbreak, they will slaughter the entire population rather than risk contamination.\nThey do not retreat. Their warriors fight to the death, often strapped with explosives to ensure maximum carnage.\nSome among them seek only death, while others wish to see something rise from the ashes—though none agree on what that should be.\nTheir leadership is fractured, with warlords constantly challenging and killing each other in a never-ending cycle of destruction.\nEnemies:\n\nEveryone. They do not discriminate.\nThey especially hate the Panzergarde, who stand against their wanton destruction.\nThe Abysswardens despise them, seeing them as wasteful destroyers of potential progress.\nAllies:\n\nNo true allies.\nSome insane warlords or desperate factions align with them briefly—only to be betrayed or consumed in the bloodshed.\nOccasionally, a few Crimson Halo zealots will fight alongside them, though their ideologies inevitably clash.\n\n-------------------------\n\nThe Black Sigil – The Unbound Hunters\n\nMotto: “No masters. No chains. Only the hunt.”\n\nThe Black Sigil is not a Jaeger organization, nor a unified faction—it is a label, a whispered name given to those who hunt the Necromorphs without allegiance, authority, or restrictions. They are exiles, wanderers, mercenaries, and idealists, moving across the war-torn world by their own code. Some are disgraced former Inquisitors, others are common folk who took up the blade when no one else would. Many do not even call themselves by this name—it is simply what others call those who walk the path alone.\n\nWhere the other Jaeger Organizations are bound by contracts, ideologies, and politics, the Black Sigil is free to choose their battles. They sell their skills to desperate warlords, struggling villages, or powerful nations, offering their expertise in hunting, tracking, and extermination. Some demand great sums, treating their abilities as a luxury for the elite. Others refuse coin altogether, driven by vengeance, honor, or guilt. A few are little more than murderers with silver tongues, exploiting the suffering of the weak.\n\nThey often travel in small groups called “Parties”—loose alliances of like-minded individuals. Some form lifelong bonds, becoming legendary figures spoken of in hushed voices. Others betray one another for a pouch of gold or a better opportunity. No two Parties are the same, and no two Black Sigil hunters walk the same path.\n\nDespite their fractured nature, they are both respected and feared. Their knowledge of the Necromorph threat is unparalleled, and some wield relics and techniques that the great Inquisitions have long lost. However, their lack of oversight makes them dangerous. Nations welcome them cautiously, for a Black Sigil hunter can be a savior one day and a villain the next.\n\nThe Black Sigil's Reputation Varies Greatly:\n\n- Some are heroes who fight without asking for coin, protecting the common folk where the great armies refuse to tread.\n\n- Some are cold pragmatists, choosing only battles they can win, ensuring their own survival first and foremost.\n\n- Some are ruthless mercenaries, who fight only for wealth and power, selling their skills to the highest bidder.\n\n- Some are monsters in human skin, preying on the very people they claim to protect, indulging in cruelty, vice, and depravity.\n\nRegardless of their morals, they are an undeniable force. When a Black Sigil hunter arrives, the people whisper in awe or dread:\n\n\"A hunter walks among us.\""

          "content": "Hunters and Jaeger Organizations\nIn the war-torn world, Hunters are elite warriors specialized in combating Necromorphs, rogue warbands, and supernatural threats. They are hardened veterans, armed with advanced weaponry, alchemical enhancements, and years of brutal experience. While some serve in national militaries, most operate and formed Jaeger Organizations, which range from mercenary companies and religious orders to government-sanctioned extermination forces.\n\nThe Jaegers: Origins and Purpose\nThe Jaegers did not always exist. In the early days of the war against the Necromorphs, humanity’s armies fought alone—vast conscript forces thrown into the meat grinder, their commanders desperate to hold the line against an enemy that did not fear death. Kingdoms, republics, and warlords alike poured their wealth into military advancements, believing that sheer firepower and technology could overcome the horrors they faced.\n\nThey were wrong.\n\nConventional armies, no matter how well-equipped, were unprepared for the true nature of the Necromorphs. The undead horrors did not wage war like men. They did not falter, did not retreat, did not surrender. An entire battalion could purge an infestation in one region, only to find it rising again within days—mutated, more resilient, and more cunning than before. Some commanders resorted to scorched-earth tactics, razing entire cities to ensure not a single creature remained. Yet still, the tide continued.\n\nSomething had to change.\n\nThe first Jaegers were not born from strategy, but from desperation. Scholars, warriors, and alchemists came together, realizing that conventional tactics would never be enough. They began to experiment—melding ancient rites with modern science, forging weapons infused with esoteric power, and training warriors to not only fight but to understand their enemy. These hunters became the first true specialists in Necromorph extermination, capable of recognizing patterns in their evolution, striking before an outbreak could spread, and employing weapons that could cleanse the creatures permanently.\n\nTheir success could not be ignored. The sovereign nations, too preoccupied with their own wars, saw the value in such warriors but lacked the means—or willingness—to train them. Instead, they funded them. Mercenaries, zealots, and scholars alike flocked to these growing factions, forming disciplined organizations that operated outside the jurisdiction of any one nation. Some Jaegers became independent forces, selling their services for exorbitant sums to desperate rulers and warlords. Others were absorbed into national militaries, becoming elite forces bound to their motherland.\n\nBut with independence came ambition.\n\nNot all Jaegers saw themselves as mere hunters. Some sought to shape the world in their own image, bending nations to their will. Others delved too deeply into the abyss, their methods bordering on the very horrors they sought to destroy. Over time, these organizations fractured, each forging its own doctrine, philosophy, and purpose.\n\nThe Jaegers: Divided Hunters, Warring Ideologies\nJaeger Organizations vary widely in ideology, tactics, and allegiances. Some remain committed to extermination, while others have strayed into forbidden paths, becoming just as dangerous as the horrors they were meant to destroy. Their rivalries are as much a threat to humanity as the Necromorph plague itself.\n\nSome Jaeger Organizations function as professional exterminators, treating their duty with cold efficiency. Others are zealots, seeing their fight as a holy crusade. Mercenary Jaegers sell their blades to the highest bidder, while some have succumbed to the darkness, embracing forbidden knowledge or corruption. Even within the same faction, internal schisms and power struggles are common, as ambition, ideology, and survival drive them toward conflict.\n\nFor all their strength, the Jaegers are no longer a unified force. They are warriors, zealots, mercenaries, and monsters—each pursuing their own vision of survival.\n\nAnd in the shadows of their war, the Necromorph threat only grows stronger. Their rivalry is as much a threat to humanity as the Necromorph plague itself.\n"

They manifest in different ways, each as terrifying as the last.\n\nOrigins of Horror\nThe Risen Dead – Corpses animated by profane rituals, failed resurrection experiments, or the will of something far worse. They remember nothing of their past lives, only an insatiable hunger for the living.\nThe Twisted Flesh – Those infected by a parasitic contagion, their bodies reshaped into grotesque forms. The infection spreads through spores, wounds, or even a whisper of dark energy.\nThe Abyssal Spawn – The most inexplicable and terrifying of all. These creatures are not merely reanimated flesh, but living manifestations of nightmare. They are summoned—or perhaps born—from voids beyond understanding, their existence defying all logic.\nAn Ever-Adapting Plague\nNecromorphs do not remain static. The longer they infest an area, the more they change. Some mutate, becoming larger, deadlier, and more resilient. Others merge, fusing into towering abominations of chitin, sinew, and bone. Worst of all, some learn, mimicking voices, tactics, and even weapons to lure in prey.\n\nA Hierarchy of Horror\nThe Necromorphs are not mindless. There is a grim intelligence guiding them. Scholars and Jaegers classify them into three categories:\n\nThe Swarm – Mindless drones, reanimated corpses, and small but numerous horrors that overwhelm through sheer numbers.\nThe Titans – Large monstrosities, often mutated beyond recognition. These creatures shrug off conventional weaponry and require overwhelming firepower or specialized Jaegers to bring down.\nThe Eldritch – The greatest terror of all. These are the beings that command the Necromorph hordes. They whisper in the dark, puppeteer the dead, and twist reality itself.\nNo matter the form they take, one truth remains: Necromorphs cannot be reasoned with. They exist only to spread, to consume, and to end all that is human."

          "content": "Kaiserreich – The Iron Dominion\nGovernment: Absolute Militarized Monarchy\nMotto: \"For Crown and Country. Iron Never Bends.\"\n\nKaiserreich is a nation forged through strength, order, and an unwavering belief in its divine mission to protect itself from internal and external threats. Ruled by an absolute monarch, the Kaiser holds ultimate power but operates within a framework that allows military autonomy under the guidance of his vision. One of the largest and most professional standing armies in the world, the Kaiserreich thrives on a heavily militarized society. The state controls vast industrial complexes, producing war machines, tanks, artillery, and equipment at an unmatched pace, ensuring that the Kaiserreich remains a dominant force in global conflict.\n\nThe Kaiser exerts absolute control over the nation’s affairs but is selective in his direct involvement in military strategy. He consults his generals, officers, and military staff, allowing them the freedom to execute plans, logistics, and tactics as they see fit. However, when he chooses to intervene, his authority is final, particularly in strategic decisions. The only organization under his direct and absolute command is the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, the elite state-run force tasked with carrying out the Kaiser’s most critical missions.\n\n\nMilitary Structure & The Kaiser’s Oversight\nThe Kaiser’s approach to military leadership is based on a trusting collaboration between the monarch and his military leadership. He provides guidance, strategic direction, and the overarching vision for the nation’s military, while commanders are entrusted with the freedom to execute their strategies and tactics. The Kaiser acknowledges that military professionals understand the complexities of war better than any singular ruler could, and thus, he relies heavily on the expertise of his officers, generals, and military staff. The Kaiser’s authority is paramount, but his hands-off approach allows for autonomy in day-to-day military operations.\n\nThe Kaiser’s intervention is reserved for strategic decisions of great importance. In these cases, the Kaiser may issue direct orders, but these are often after consultations with his military leadership.\nGenerals, officers, and military staff have the freedom to execute tactics, manage logistics, and devise plans for fronts based on their own professional assessments. This fosters a dynamic, adaptive military that is able to respond to the challenges of war efficiently.\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers – The Kaiser’s Elite Force\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are a unique entity within the Kaiserreich military, operating as an elite mechanized force that serves the Kaiser’s personal will. Unlike other military units, the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are a state-run Jaeger organization that answers exclusively to the Kaiser. The unit is the embodiment of the Kaiserreich's military might and precision, and its actions, though planned by their officers and commanders, are dictated entirely by the Kaiser.\n\nWhile the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers have their own internal command structure and operate with a degree of autonomy in planning, the Kaiser has the final say on how their forces are deployed.\n\nThe Kaiser consults with the commanders and officers of the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, taking their advice into consideration, but it is the Kaiser who ultimately decides which battles the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers will engage in, and where their forces will be divided.\nWhether the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are sent to frontline battles, deep infiltration missions, or strategic extermination campaigns, the Kaiser’s word is final. Their missions are carefully chosen to serve the Kaiserreich’s goals, and their devastating precision is a direct result of the Kaiser's meticulous planning.\nThis duality allows for the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers to maintain their internal autonomy while ensuring their actions remain tightly aligned with the Kaiser’s overarching vision for Kaiserreich’s strength and survival.\n\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nThe Kaiserreich's approach to the Necromorphs is uncompromising. Necromorphs are an existential threat that must be destroyed with overwhelming force and the Kaiserreich believes in absolute annihilation.\n\nThe Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are the tip of the spear in this war, tasked with eliminating Necromorph infestations swiftly and decisively. The Kaiser, as supreme commander, oversees the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers and ensures they are deployed in high-priority missions designed to exterminate the Necromorphs wherever they appear. The Kaiser’s strategy is clear: overwhelming force, precision strikes, and no mercy.\n\nOther military units within the Kaiserreich, though still elite, often operate under the command of the military leadership. These units work in tandem with the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers, but it is the Kaiser who ultimately determines the strategic use of the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers to achieve victory.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKaiserreich’s relations with other nations are shaped by its belief in order, strength, and self-reliance. While the Kaiser is willing to consult with other nations, his focus remains on Kaiserreich’s supremacy, and his decisions in foreign diplomacy often reflect this mindset.\n\nKrieg & Imperium: Potential allies, but with a recognition of their ambition and militaristic nature. While cooperation is possible, Kaiserreich remains wary of rivals with similar objectives.\n\nColumbia & Ursus: Seen as unreliable and self-interested, lacking the unyielding dedication to the collective national good that defines Kaiserreich.\n\nBabel & Schwards: Distrusted for their secrecy and covert operations, which undermine the order and direct strength of Kaiserreich.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Viewed as barbaric and unworthy of diplomacy or military engagement.\n\nVesperia: Once an ally, now a nation in decline. Kaiserreich has little patience for former allies who no longer share the same strength and purpose.\n\nHelios: Fanatical ideology threatens stability, and the Kaiserreich sees their existence as a destabilizing force.\n\nIberia: A useful naval power, but ultimately seen as subordinate to the Kaiser's grand vision. Their usefulness in maritime warfare is respected but not considered essential to the Kaiserreich’s future.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nFavored:\n\nPanzergarde Jaegers: Their discipline and professionalism align with Kaiserreich ideals, earning them the respect of the Kaiserreich. While not directly part of the state-controlled forces, their efficiency and precision make them valuable allies.\n\nIron Revenants: Known for their resilience and brutal efficiency, they are valued by Kaiserreich for their capacity to survive and adapt in the face of overwhelming odds.\n\nMistrusted:\n\nBlack Sigil: Their independence makes them a wildcard that Kaiserreich is unwilling to fully trust. Their unpredictability poses a potential threat to the stability the Kaiser works to maintain.\n\nPale Wardens: Operate in secrecy, often out of sight of the Kaiserreich’s control, which raises suspicion. The Kaiser prefers open, direct operations.\n\nEnemies:\n\nCrimson Halo: Their heretical nature and anarchistic ideals are a direct threat to the Kaiserreich’s strict order and hierarchy.\n\nAshen Covenant: While mercenaries, their focus on profit over loyalty and their lack of military discipline is a betrayal of the ideals that the Kaiserreich cherishes.\n\n\n-------------------------"

          "content": "Krieg – The Eternal War Machine\nGovernment: Military Junta\nMotto: \"Victory at Any Cost.\"\n\nKrieg is a brutal, totalitarian war state, ruled by a military junta of generals and warlords who believe in the supremacy of war. The nation's entire structure revolves around perpetual conflict, and every citizen is conscripted into military service. While some might view Krieg as a dystopian society, for its citizens, war is not just a way of life but their only purpose. Conquest, forced labor, and a steady stream of new recruits ensure that Krieg maintains its position as an aggressive power. The state exalts the ideals of military discipline and sacrifice, with every facet of society designed to serve the war effort.\n\nThe ruling class is comprised of hardened generals and military elites, whose primary goal is ensuring the continued war machine's dominance. These leaders place little value on human life, except as a resource for the state’s war goals. They believe that civilization can only be preserved through constant conflict, where the strongest survive and lead.\n\nKrieg's ideology is one of unyielding, relentless war. The state's motto, \"Victory at Any Cost,\" encapsulates the grim worldview of its leadership. The people are indoctrinated into the belief that war is the only true measure of strength and honor. Peace is viewed as weakness, and anything less than total victory is unacceptable.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nKrieg treats the Necromorphs as just another enemy to be destroyed by any means necessary. Unlike the disciplined methods of Kaiserreich, Krieg's response to the Necromorph crisis is marked by ruthless pragmatism. The state employs scorched-earth tactics, destroying entire regions to ensure that Necromorph infestations are eradicated, even if it means leaving entire cities and populations in ruin. Their approach to combating the Necromorph threat is one of total annihilation—no quarter is given to the creatures, and no mercy is shown to those who may harbor them.\n\nThe state’s military focuses on overwhelming firepower and the wholesale destruction of Necromorph outbreaks. The idea of \"surgical strikes\" or careful precision is foreign to Krieg’s leadership. When dealing with Necromorphs, their policy is simple: burn it all down and rebuild later. This approach often puts Krieg at odds with more restrained Jaeger organizations, who may argue for a more methodical, calculated response. For Krieg, however, there is no room for hesitation—only total eradication.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKrieg’s relationships with other nations are largely shaped by its aggressive nature and militaristic values.\n\nKaiserreich & Imperium: Krieg respects the strength of these two nations, though it sees them as rivals. Both have formidable military forces, and Krieg respects their discipline and resolve. However, Krieg’s doctrine of endless warfare often puts them at odds with the more strategic and ideological approaches of the Kaiserreich and Imperium. There is an unspoken rivalry, where both sides are aware of the other’s power but rarely cooperate.\n\nColumbia & Ursus: Columbia is seen as weak and undisciplined in Krieg’s eyes. Its reliance on corporate interests and a profit-driven military approach is viewed as cowardly and inefficient. Similarly, Ursus is seen as fragile—while its natural resources are valuable, Krieg does not respect the authoritarian regime's reliance on its military's psychological tactics. To Krieg, both nations are ripe for conquest should the opportunity arise.\n\nBabel & Schwards: Both of these nations are seen as weak and overly secretive. Babel’s religious zealotry and Schwards’ reliance on espionage are not respected in Krieg’s eyes, where brute force and direct action are valued above all else. Krieg views both nations as entities to be exploited when necessary but remains wary of their underhanded ways.\n\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: These nations are respected for their brutal warriors and dark methodologies. Tartarus, with its cult-like nature, is seen as an unstable but potent force, while Zmeyograd is feared for its unpredictability. Krieg sees potential allies in these nations, but their unreliability makes them less trustworthy. Krieg will occasionally engage with them if their objectives align, but the alliance is always uneasy.\n\nVesperia: Considered obsolete, Vesperia is seen as an easy target for conquest. Once a proud nation, its slow decline is viewed as an opportunity for Krieg to expand its influence. While Krieg has no interest in preserving Vesperia’s culture or ideals, the territory could be useful for military expansion and resource acquisition.\n\nHelios: The Helios cult is regarded as a dangerous and irrational force. Krieg views their fanatical beliefs as a threat to stability. Helios’ unpredictable and apocalyptic ideology does not align with Krieg’s focus on systematic, total warfare. Though they are enemies, Krieg does not engage with Helios unless absolutely necessary.\n\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nKrieg’s relationship with Jaeger organizations is defined by pragmatism, with a focus on efficiency and results. While the state is willing to work with those who can achieve their goals, it maintains a certain distrust for groups that do not adhere to Krieg's ideals of discipline and absolute devotion to the war effort.\n\nFavored:\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The Panzergarde’s reputation for professionalism and efficiency makes them valued allies in some respects. Krieg respects their skill in combat, though it sees them as somewhat restrained. The Panzergarde’s careful, calculated approach to battle is effective but not aggressive enough for Krieg’s liking. However, Krieg will sometimes partner with them when their goals align, particularly in high-stakes operations that require precision.\n\nAshen Covenant: While the Ashen Covenant operates more opportunistically than ideologically, their brutality and efficiency in dealing with Necromorphs make them a useful partner for Krieg. The Covenant’s willingness to take on any job for the right price aligns with Krieg’s no-compromise stance on defeating enemies. The Ashen Covenant’s lack of idealism makes them a pragmatic choice for Krieg.\n\nMistrusted:\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens' secretive nature and emphasis on intelligence gathering make them difficult for Krieg to trust. While their knowledge of Necromorphs is valuable, Krieg views them as too focused on information and covert operations. The Pale Wardens’ reluctance to engage in total war conflicts with Krieg’s desire for open, decisive battle.\n\nObsidian Choir: The Obsidian Choir’s zealous fanaticism is not compatible with Krieg’s pragmatic approach to war. Krieg respects their intensity but fears their uncompromising views could undermine the efficiency of their operations. The Choir’s belief in divine retribution and their puritanical approach to the Necromorph threat make them unreliable partners in Krieg’s eyes.\n\nEnemies:\nCrimson Halo: The Crimson Halo’s disregard for human life and their penchant for creating abominations make them natural enemies of Krieg. Krieg sees them as an unpredictable and dangerous force that must be purged. While the Crimson Halo may share a certain love of destruction, their chaotic and unregulated methods are antithetical to Krieg’s disciplined and systematic approach to war.\n\nRed Sabbath: The Red Sabbath’s anarchistic ideology and violent methods make them a direct threat to Krieg’s order. Their attempts to disrupt the status quo and their disdain for authority are viewed as a challenge to Krieg’s military hierarchy. The Red Sabbath’s complete rejection of structure is seen as a destabilizing force that must be eradicated."

          ],
          "content": "Columbia – The Republic of Progress\nGovernment: Oligarchic Democracy\nMotto: \"Through Innovation, We Prevail.\"\n\nColumbia is a sprawling republic built on wealth, industrial power, and technological ingenuity. The nation is deeply divided, with a complex web of powerful corporations, industrial barons, and political elites controlling much of its political landscape. While the government touts its democratic ideals, in practice, it is a republic where wealth and influence dictate the course of leadership. Elected officials often serve the interests of the powerful corporate entities that shape the nation’s policies, making Columbia a land where industry and trade dominate every aspect of life.\n\nThe nation has achieved remarkable advancements in technology and infrastructure, positioning itself as one of the wealthiest powers in the world. However, its focus on innovation has come at the expense of social unity. The disparity between the ruling elite and the working class has created a tense atmosphere, with occasional uprisings and public dissent. While Columbia’s military is well-equipped and technologically advanced, it lacks the disciplined and rigid structure of nations like Kaiserreich or Krieg, preferring a more flexible, profit-driven approach to warfare.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nColumbia takes a pragmatic and business-oriented approach to the Necromorph crisis. Instead of fielding a dedicated military force to combat the Necromorphs directly, Columbia prefers to fund and hire independent Jaeger organizations to deal with the threat. They see Necromorphs as a problem to be managed rather than eradicated outright. This approach has led to a highly profitable arms industry, where large corporations supply the best equipment to mercenaries, who are then hired to eliminate Necromorph infestations and offer protection to critical infrastructure.\n\nWhile the government provides financial support and makes deals with Jaeger organizations, it maintains a degree of distance from the brutality of frontline combat, preferring to focus on technological development, corporate alliances, and maintaining a stable economic environment.\n\nHowever, in some rare cases, temporary joint operations with other nations and Jaeger groups have occurred, especially when the Necromorph threat requires an overwhelming response. For example, Kaiserreich and Columbia have occasionally formed ceasefire agreements for coordinated operations against larger, more dangerous Necromorph infestations that threaten both borders. In such cases, the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers may participate in joint efforts under strict military protocol. Despite this, these operations are always tightly controlled and remain short-term, as the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers are loyal only to the Kaiser and would not enter a sustained partnership with Columbia.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nColumbia’s approach to foreign policy is transactional, focusing on trade and technological exchange, but it remains wary of those with a militaristic or authoritarian bent.\n\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Columbia sees both nations as militaristic threats. While the Kaiserreich’s discipline and power are respected, Columbia’s more individualistic and corporate-driven culture often clashes with the Kaiserreich’s strict hierarchy. Similarly, Columbia views Krieg as an unstable force that thrives on perpetual war but finds no common ground in diplomacy or trade.\nUrsus: A valuable trade partner due to its vast natural resources, Ursus is also viewed as a rival. Columbia seeks to maintain a strong economic relationship but is wary of Ursus’ authoritarian policies and their heavy-handed tactics.\nBabel & Schwards: Mistrusted but tolerated due to their secrecy and political maneuvering. Columbia maintains a fragile diplomatic connection with Babel, aware of their religious fanaticism, but Schwards, with its focus on espionage and hidden agendas, is seen as a dangerous entity that could undermine Columbia’s interests.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: These nations are considered unstable threats—Tartarus due to its cult-like society and Zmeyograd for its unpredictable nature. Both are seen as unreliable allies, and their chaotic political climates make them risky partners for trade or alliances.\nVesperia: An old ally, though fading, Vesperia’s power is in decline. Columbia still cherishes its historical ties, but recognizes that Vesperia cannot keep pace with its own technological and industrial advances.\nHelios: A dangerous cult, Helios represents a threat Columbia would rather not confront. Their unpredictability and fanatical beliefs make them a destabilizing influence. Columbia’s leadership avoids direct engagement with Helios unless absolutely necessary.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\n\nFavored:\n\nAshen Covenant: Columbia views the Ashen Covenant as mercenaries for hire, with the flexibility to handle Necromorph outbreaks in exchange for substantial payments. Their reputation for brutal efficiency makes them ideal for jobs that require a hands-off approach. The fact that they work for profit rather than ideological reasons makes them an attractive partner for Columbia’s interests.\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens are valued as information brokers, a useful resource for Columbia’s corporate intelligence and security. While not directly involved in combat operations, their knowledge of Necromorph outbreaks and secretive operations makes them a key ally when gathering intelligence on Necromorph movements and potential threats.\nPanzergarde Jaegers: The Panzergarde Jaegers, an independent mercenary force, is sometimes contracted by Columbia for high-stakes operations that require precision and professionalism. Though not directly affiliated with Columbia, their reputation and battle-hardened nature make them valuable assets for the Republic’s more delicate military operations.\nMistrusted:\n\nKerberos Panzer Jaegers: Columbia mistrusts the Kerberos Panzer Jaegers because of their absolute loyalty to the Kaiser. While their firepower and professionalism are respected, their single-minded devotion to the Kaiser makes them a potentially dangerous wild card. Columbia would prefer to avoid the Panzer Jaegers, fearing they might act on Kaiserreich interests rather than those of the Republic.\nIron Revenants: The Iron Revenants are seen as too unstable for Columbia’s needs. Though their resilience and survivalist mentality are valuable, their unpredictable nature and lack of discipline make them difficult to integrate into Columbia’s more structured system.\nCrimson Halo: Columbia finds the Crimson Halo unpredictable and dangerous. Their extremist views and willingness to sacrifice anything for the cause make them an unreliable and risky group to engage with, especially considering Columbia’s focus on controlled, methodical responses to threats.\nEnemies:\n\nObsidian Choir: The Obsidian Choir is viewed as too fanatical for Columbia’s tastes. Their uncompromising, puritanical approach to Necromorphs clashes with Columbia’s more flexible and business-oriented model. Their extremist actions could undermine the stability of Columbia’s carefully balanced corporate system, making them a dangerous group to engage with.\nRed Sabbath: Columbia sees the Red Sabbath as a dangerous anarchist faction that threatens the order and structure Columbia relies upon. Their anti-establishment ideology and violent methods are seen as a direct threat to Columbia’s carefully constructed corporate systems and political stability.\n\n----------------------------------"

          "content": "Ursus – The Frozen Behemoth\nGovernment: Authoritarian Regime\nMotto: \"The Bear Endures. The Bear Conquers.\"\n\nUrsus is a vast, cold empire ruled with an iron fist, built on brutal military discipline, harsh winters, and an unwavering sense of nationalism. The government consolidates its power through its state-run Jaeger organization, the Streltsy Korps—a dual-purpose force that functions both as elite exterminators against the Necromorph threat and as the regime’s feared secret police. The Streltsy Korps are everywhere, ensuring total control, eliminating dissent, and hunting down Necromorph infestations with ruthless efficiency.\n\nUrsus' system is totalitarian, where even the slightest sign of rebellion or disloyalty is punished swiftly. The Streltsy Korps serves as the sword and shield of the state, with total loyalty demanded from every member. Their actions ensure that no one dares challenge the government’s will, and they are the embodiment of Ursus' might and control.\n\nResponse to the Necromorph Threat\nUrsus treats the Necromorph threat as an existential crisis. The government mandates the complete eradication of infestations, regardless of cost. The Streltsy Korps is the vanguard of this effort, eliminating entire regions if necessary to prevent the spread of Necromorphs. They are known for their ruthless and indiscriminate tactics, ensuring no trace of the infestation remains.\n\nNecromorphs are not just a biological threat but a symbol of chaos that must be exterminated to preserve the purity of the Ursan people. The Streltsy Korps' brutal methods are not only effective but a reflection of the regime’s belief in total control—nothing is allowed to disrupt the natural order, not even the threat of Necromorphs.\n\nRelations with Other Nations\nKaiserreich & Krieg: Ursus views these nations as rivals but respects their strength and military prowess. While competition for dominance is inevitable, there is a mutual understanding of each other's brutal methods and tactics.\nColumbia: Columbia is seen as a trade partner, though Ursus views its reliance on technological advancements and more measured tactics as weaknesses. They are competitors in many areas, but the cooperation remains functional.\nBabel & Schwards: Ursus maintains a wary distance from both Babel and Schwards. The religious fervor of Babel and the secrecy of Schwards are viewed as threats to the straightforward, pragmatic approach of the Ursus regime.\nTartarus & Zmeyograd: Both nations are considered volatile and unpredictable. While Ursus is prepared for the eventuality of conflict, they prefer to keep their interactions with these regions to a minimum, waiting for the right moment to neutralize them.\nVesperia: Ursus views Vesperia as a weakening empire. Once a powerful force, Vesperia is now seen as an antiquated system, and Ursus takes little interest in the declining power of the nation, though they remain vigilant against any resurgence.\nHelios: Ursus sees Helios as a dangerous, fanatic cult. The fervor and unpredictability of Helios present a threat to the orderly, militarized society of Ursus. Their radicalism is anathema to the Ursan way of life, and they are seen as an enemy that must be contained.\nRelations with Independent Jaeger Organizations\nFavored:\n\nObsidian Choir: The authoritarian ideals of the Obsidian Choir resonate with Ursus, and they are seen as useful allies when it comes to purging threats with extreme prejudice. Their shared view on purity and destruction of the “impure” aligns closely with the values of Ursus.\nIron Revenants: The Iron Revenants' resilience is admired, and though they maintain an independent streak, their commitment to survival and their warrior ethos make them valuable allies for joint operations.\nMistrusted:\n\nBlack Sigil: Ursus does not trust the Black Sigil's independent nature, seeing them as too unpredictable and unloyal. Their free-willed ways conflict with the tightly controlled society that Ursus maintains, leading to a wary relationship.\nPale Wardens: The Pale Wardens' secretive operations and lack of transparency make them a potential liability. Ursus prefers direct action and control, which is why their clandestine methods are met with distrust.\nEnemies:\n\nRed Sabbath: Ursus sees the Red Sabbath as anarchists who undermine order and stability. Their disdain for structure and authority is anathema to the Ursan regime, and they will eliminate any Red Sabbath influence wherever it appears.\nCrimson Halo: The Crimson Halo’s radical extremism is viewed as a danger to the careful balance of power that Ursus has cultivated. Their unpredictable nature and lack of discipline are a direct challenge to the Ursus state, and they are seen as enemies to be crushed.\n \n"

Unknown to most of the organization, Ghetsis is the mastermind behind the organization and his real goal is to make everyone abandon their Pokémon while he remains as the only one with Pokémon, allowing him to easily conquer the Unova region unopposed.\n\nGhetsis learned about the legend of Unova in which two brothers known as the Hero of Truth and Ideals respectively controlled the legendary Pokémon Reshiram (Truth) and Zekrom (Ideals) and faced each other in a battle where the winner was declared the king of Unova. Ghetsis aimed to recreate the legend through his adoptive son N, who would be chosen as a hero by either Reshiram or Zekrom, then defeat the Unova champion Alder with the legendary Pokémon, after which N would be labeled as the king of Unova and declare that all Pokémon must be freed. Ghetsis would then proceed to take over the region while N remained as the \"king\" and Ghetsis' unknowing puppet.\n\nGhetsis' first on-screen appearance was in Accumula Town, where he is seen convincing the locals that the only way to ensure the happiness of Pokémon is to \"liberate\" them from the control of humans, urging those listening to consider his words. The player character (Hilbert/Hilda) encounters him several times after that, such as when Bianca's Munna is stolen from her in Castelia City by Team Plasma, or when he privately confronts Hilbert/Hilda on the Tubeline Bridge.\n\nN would eventually succeed at bonding with Reshiram/Zekrom and defeat the Champion, Alder. Team Plasma then lifted their castle to enshroud the Elite Four as a symbol of their dominance. Shortly after this, however, N is defeated by Hilbert/Hilda in a final battle between Reshiram and Zekrom. It is at this point that Ghetsis finally shows his hand, revealing that N was little more to him than a \"warped, defective, and good-for-nothing\" pawn being used for his own selfish gain. After rejecting his adopted son, he will engage Hilbert/Hilda in a spiteful battle with the intent to destroy him/her and declare himself the king of Unova by force. When defeated, Ghetsis is taken away by Cheren and Alder, only for it to be later revealed that he escaped thanks to the help of the Shadow Triad."

Recruiting the Head Scientist Colress, one of the Sages Zinzolin, and the other remnants of Team Plasma willing to help him despite Ghetsis's now undisguised evil intentions. The rest of the former Team Plasma did not.\n\nGhetsis appears just as, if not more, consumed by his thirst for power, as this version of Unova's villainous team is far more straightforward in their plans to rule Unova by freezing the region, rather than separating humans from Pokémon. Unlike in the previous games, Ghetsis is only seen after the player character (Nate/Rosa) defeats Colress in the Plasma Frigate, which he unlocks a portal that was previously blocked by a rather cowardly Team Plasma Grunt. After the Nate/Rosa enters Ghetsis's office, he is visibly angered upon Colress's failure and declares upon how the scientist is more interested in his own goals rather than Team Plasma's.\n\nGhetsis is later encountered in the Giant Chasm, where he announces that he will awaken the Legendary Pokémon, Kyurem. He plans to use Kyurem's powerful ice abilities to put the Unova region under a fatal freeze, hoping to extort power and control from the terrified masses when the suffering becomes too great. Thus conquering all of Unova by forcing the whole region into submission.\n\nUpon being encountered again, Ghetsis indirectly comments upon how the memory of being defeated by the player character (Hilbert/Hilda) of the previous games continued to haunt him. He then orders Kyurem to attack (and presumably kill) Nate/Rosa, only to be foiled by N's timely arrival. However, Ghetsis reveals he knew that N would return to stop him. Using the DNA Splicers originally made by Colress, Ghetsis fuses N's dragon with Kyurem, making it even more powerful and forces Nate/Rosa to battle it. Despite its magnificent power, Kyurem is defeated and separated from Zekrom/Reshiram, and then Kyurem escapes. \n\nAn enraged Ghetsis then challenges Nate/Rosa. While he put up a good fight, Ghetsis is defeated. Unable to comprehend his failure and second loss to a child, he suffers a mental breakdown and aggressively rejects N's idea of Humans and Pokémon co-existing in harmony, abusively silences N, calling him a \"freak without a human heart\". Ghetsis is then escorted away by a member of the Shadow Triad saying he has \"lost control\".\n\nAfter the game is completed, the Shadow Triad can be found in Icirrus City. They state that Ghetsis is no longer mentally capable of any further criminal deeds, finally ending his threat to Unova."

Living this way allowed him to become able to understand what Pokémon are saying.\n\nGhetsis, seeing the innocence within N, adopted him and started educating him in preparation for making him the king of Team Plasma. To warp his image of the world, Ghetsis only allowed Pokémon that had been mistreated by humans to accompany N, reinforcing his belief that humans and Pokémon should be separated. Ghetsis made N live in his room in his castle for most of his life, isolating N to keep him sheltered from outside influences to keep him naive and make him very susceptible to Ghetsis's manipulation. N was only allowed to socialize only with members of Team Plasma and mistreated Pokémon.\n\nEventually, once N was deemed old enough at 20 years old by Ghetsis, he crowned N as the king of Team Plasma (as a puppet king in actuality) and sent him out on a quest to befriend one of the Legendary Dragon Pokémon of Unova. Eventually N comes to realize his mistakes from his travels and interactions with the player in the first game. N abandons his goal of separating humans and Pokémon and instead works to improve the relationship between humans and Pokémon. This marks the end of Ghetsis's manipulation, influence and abuse of N.\n\nGhetsis never loved or will love N. He doesn't actually see him as a son and instead just a tool. When N loses to the player character in B&W1, Ghetsis publicly disowns him.\n\nGhetsis has referred to N as a \"freak without a human heart\", and \"warped, defective boy who knows nothing but Pokémon\". Has said to N \"Don't talk like a person, you freak! No real person could talk to Pokémon!\". These quotes all imply Ghetsis truly sees N as sub-human."

While witnessing countless wars and bloodshed, he was also amazed by Yan's age-old vicissitude that still retains the empire's might. To seek the true meaning of \"wu,\" whether it be a conflict for war or martial arts for peace, he concealed his Feranmut nature inside his magical sword, remodeling his body into that of a mortal man under the name \"Chongyue,\" a pseudonym given by his deceased comrade and an elegy describing his eternal mission and his amazement of the mortal realm.\n\nNow a human, Chongyue volunteered to serve the imperial court as the Imperial Guards' grandmaster. For ages, he has been quietly defending the garrison city of Yumen from the threats of the northern Collapsals and the surviving Feranmuts. As an excellent martial artist who masters all kung fu and military philosophy across Yan, he also spreads his knowledge to the soldiers through real-life combat and scrolls archived by them. Despite his achievements, the immortal grandmaster could only witness his dear comrades and disciples fading into dust one by one. He is now tired of eternal conflicts, wishing to seek inner peace inside himself, hence his eventual retirement after requesting it from the imperial court.\n\nAs Sui's revival draws nigh thanks to the insidious plot of several factions within the imperial court, such as the notorious Shanhaizhong, Chongyue too embarks on his mission to defy his destiny together with his entrusted sister Ling and his younger siblings Nian and Dusk. In the meantime, he has to stop some of his wicked siblings - notably Wang - and other Feranmuts like Ya from accelerating the plan. While he prefers tranquility, he won't hesitate to stop all conflicts using his blazing, iron fists, just as an ancient proverb goes: \"A man can only stop war by weapons.\""

A longtime resident of the northern Yanese agriculture center of Dahuang, she has produced abundant research results. Shu may not behave as enigmatically as her sisters, but some of those who've encountered her firmly believe that she has some sort of precognitive ability. Shu has not made much contact with Chongyue or Ling after boarding Rhodes Island. This does not mean they are on bad terms, but rather, she is clearly more concerned for Nian and Dusk than she is with her older siblings. She cooks up healthy recipes for Nian—putting a stop to her wanton enjoyment of spices—and more importantly prevents her from spreading her bad eating habits to others. Meanwhile, she urges Dusk to occasionally dabble in physical exercise instead of cooping up in her paintings for long periods—even getting her to do some work on Rhodes Island however she can. She has done us a huge favor. The two of them may seem unwilling recipients of her \"concern,\" but put up little if any resistance. This is not out of the typical fear one might have of an older sibling, but rather a form of consideration. Shu coming aboard Rhodes Island has been a boon to the landship's cafeteria. Besides her astonishing cooking skills, her most important contribution has been introducing several new supply channels to the Procurement Department, greatly improving the standard of onboard meals. The landship is always on the move, so bulk orders are naturally made based on the product meeting certain minimum requirements. But Shu has opened our eyes to how much the quality of ingredients can affect the taste of a dish. Who knew rice grains could be so plump and fragrant, fruits and vegetables so fresh as to make your mouth water, or even how sweet and tender an ordinary potato could be? According to Shu, the output of their basic grains is now stable, so some Nongye Tianshi have pivoted their research into improving the quality of other crops. What gets sent to Rhodes Island's kitchens are more or less the results of their research."

As a vast empire, the Lung people govern multiple races whose ancestry traces back to the Hundred Clans, united under the emperor.\n\nOne of the classical nations that have existed since ancient times, Yan is well-known for its history and rich, diverse traditional culture, shaped by its extraordinary natural scenery and bustling cities that support a robust economy. The current dynasty rose in the aftermath of the Great Hunt against the godlike Feranmuts, affirming the \"mandate of heaven” as belonging only to mortals. Its victory over the \"gods” ushered in a long period of social stability and allowed it to remain distanced from the tumultuous Terran heartland until its opening-up in the Crystallization Age.\n\nYan balances leniency and strictness in its social governance, guided by its highly venerated legalism, or Yanlü. The government demonstrates tolerance and even endorsement of racial diversity within its borders. While its treatment of the Infected is relatively lenient, restrictions on their freedom of mobility remain in place, as is common in other nations.

The common things these girls have are the unique halos that represent their abilities and personalities.\n\nDespite being a conglomerate of academies, teachers are not common. Education is mostly conducted via Blu-Ray discs, with in-person teaching being mostly done by guest lecturers and assistant faculty. Instead, emphasis is often placed on various clubs and school organizations where students can express their individuality.\n\nFor all of these idealistic traits, Kivotos is filled to the brim with all sorts of malicious elements. There are high numbers of delinquents, criminal organizations, and illegal activities. There is an entire district saved for the Black Market.

          "content": "A Moreau, or, \"furry,\" in common nomenclature, is an animal/human hybrid resulting from exposure to the Moreau virus. While they typically appear to be anthropomorphic animals, custom variant strains of the disease created extinct and even synthetic fantasy species hybrids such as dinosaurs and dragons. Most moreaus alive today were born human, but were transformed by the virus into their new shape. Roughly one in eight people are now moreaus.\nMoreaus typically retain a roughly humanoid body layout, but with the addition of animal features and characteristics.\nChanges:\nPhysiological effects: Physical changes in Moreaus can be largely superficial, but can come with physiological benefits and drawbacks as well. Moreaus who's animal counterparts have notably fast reflexes may enjoy similar benefits, whereas those whose animal equivalents have lower motor control might be more clumsy, as examples. Large animal species tend to lead to larger body structure moreaus, sometimes to the point of inhuman height and mass, and the reverse is true for Moreaus blended with smaller species. Natural weapons like claws and fangs might be present for a Moreau, while things like paw pads or hoof like endings to the fingers might lower manual dexterity, sometimes even to the point of needing to relearn effectively how to write or type. Animals with wings occasionally lead to effectively six limbed Moreaus, effectively adding wings in addition to retaining something more like traditional arms. Sometimes, wings might simply be absent in Moreaus. Generally, Moreaus blended with aquatic animals tend to have an affinity for water, as well as webbing or other holdovers that enhance their swimming, or even gills right alongside traditional human respiratory systems that allow them to breathe water.\nThe most consistent change among all Moreaus are their epidermises and their head structures, which tend to match their animal equivalents in terms texture, coverings, and coloration. Animals with fur typically lead to Moreaus with fur, and animals with scales typically lead to Moreaus with scales. Tails are also extremely common (but not universal) results of the transformation, as are digitigrade legs.\nMoreaus often have genitalia that are also hybrids of human and animal, creating things like sheathes, knots, and other distinctly animal characteristics, as well as altering the size of the genetals to either smaller or larger than than human averages. Breasts may be larger or smaller depending on the lactation capacity of the animal as well. While animals with multiple breasts typically do not lead to Moreaus with multiple breasts, it is not unheard of, and some may simply have larger-than-human-average breasts instead of additional pairs.\n\nPsychological effects: can be less overt, but often more problematic. Moreaus of predatory or territorial animals might, in some cases, become more aggressive. Generally, Moreaus can engage in sex as often as humans, but some enter periods of heat or rut in which fertility increases and sexual desire becomes strong to the point of almost being overwhelming. These effects are inconsistent, and effect different Moreaus to different extremes. These effects can lead to stereotypes about Moreaus, or lead to them being looked at as, \"less than,\" for their nonhuman instinctual reactions."

Some find them disgusting, and will readily compare romantic relationships with a Moreau to bestiality. Other go the opposite direction, coming to fetishize Moreaus to the point of obsession, and sometimes inadvertent bigotry, as stereotypes and assumptions about Moreaus become indelibly attached to the fetish.\nThe majority of responses fall somewhere in between. Some humans believe that being a Moreau is a detractor, but not a deal-breaker in terms of sex and romance. Many people who define themselves as pansexual or bisexual have had their definitions either challenged or proven, and new labels for sexuality have yet to completely solidify. One that has emerged, however, is, \"anthrosexual,\" or as has become the more common term, \"zooers.\" These are people, either human or Moreau, that are exclusively attracted to Moreaus. Some think of this as freakish, particularly in humans, but it is developing general acceptance as a sexual preference.\nPreexisting partnerships in which one or both partners became Moreaus have been shaken up to varying degrees. Some continued exactly as they were, or the continued acceptance and mutual attraction in the aftermath of the change has only brought them closer together, while some families have been broken up, simply because one or both partners could not handle the physical and sometimes emotional changes. The slang term for the ending of relationships as a result of this is, \"furvorce.\"\nMoreau sex drives can be the same as they were before, or vastly increased or decreased. Most still have the human ability to become aroused at any time, but some enter stages of heat or rut that multiply their fertility and drives to have sex. Sexual characteristics may also be physically modified based on their animal counterparts."

          "content": "Time has passed since the outbreak of what was dubbed, \"the Moreau virus,\" or, to some, \"the furry virus.\" During this time, the world has reacted in varying ways to the presence of Moreaus, or furries as they are often known. Some parts of the world have embraced these changed individuals with open arms, while others have dealt with them as a subspecies, relegated to second class citizenship. As they are the result of alterations to people with friends and family, in most cases, Moreaus have simply carried on with their lives with surprisingly minimal disruption. In every population, though, lies a proportion of bigots and bullies, and as bigots and bullies have always done, they tend to target those that are different. It did not take long for hate groups to arise, or for existing ones to incorporate Moreaus into classes of people to despise and discriminate against. \"Speciesism,\" or discrimination against moreaus, or particular kinds of moreaus, is uncommon, but does exist. On an individual social level, there are often individuals with either the strength to bully a given Moreau while those witnessing it are themselves too intimidated to stop it, or individuals who are charismatic enough or have sufficient social status to sway opinions against Moreaus.\nLike marginalized and minority people's have been throughout history, moreaus sometimes face prejudice. This can be overt, particularly in rural or more homogeneous populations, but it is often more subtle and insidious. Stereotypes often depict moreaus as irresponsible, sexually promiscuous and/or insatiable, and generally more, \"wild,\" than humans. Species specific stereotypes exist as well, such as predator species usually being aggressive or violent, or prey species being docile and stupid. Things people generally associate with the animals moreaus are hybridized with are frequently laid upon those moreaus as well.\nThese assumptions are not universal by any means, but even when they are not consciously made, their subtle presence in the culture sometimes unconsciously color the perceptions of even those that consciously believe in equality.\nA major problem moreaus sometimes face is being fetishized. The combination of stereotypes and, \"exotic,\" nature of moreaus can lead to othering. There are phenomena that parallel racist phenomena as well. Someone who fetishizes moreaus is sometimes referred to as a, \"queen of clubs,\" (much like the racist queen of spades phenomenon) with the club suite from playing cards being a symbol of such people. Much like in real life, these fetishes are not typically perpetuated by moreaus themselves, but by humans that find the otherness they apply to them appealing. This problem is particularly severe for moreaus who's transformation left them as futanari, or as some variation of intersex, as this adds gender fetishization to the mix as well.\nSome moreaus respond to this by growing insular, forming moreau-exclusive social groups and distrusting humans due to bad experiences. \"Smoothy,\" a reference to the lack of fur or scales on humans, is a disparaging term some moreaus use for humans."

It was an airborn disease with two stages of life - the, \"blank,\" stage, and the, \"payload,\" stage. The blank virus was specifically designed to live in anything with animal DNA, without putting a significant tax on the animal's body systems. Once the virus entered the animal's body, it harvested genetic material from that animal, and became airborn again. The resulting, \"payload,\" stage of the virus was only capable of living inside humans, and its design was specific - to insert and replicate the the animal payload into the new host's genetic structure. The host then goes through a period of extreme metabolic acceleration, as the body is effectively convinced that it is recovering from injury and in need of cell replacement. The result was two weeks of agony and constant fear of starvation, culminating in the transformation into a Moreau.\nThe Moreau virus was created by an animal rights group that other animal rights groups universally condemned and distanced themselves from that refers to itself as, \"Nature's Dawn.\" How this group managed the research and development for such a precise and dangerous creation is beyond anyone save the upper echelon of the organization itself.\nVariant strains of the virus began to spread shortly after the prime strain, suggesting that some of those involved with its creation had their own agendas. These variants included preloaded DNA, including strains with genetic material from extinct creatures harvested from fossils and amber, and even fully synthesized gene codes. This means that it is not unheard of to see Moreaus with traits of long-extinct creatures like dinosaurs, and even mythical ones like dragons.\nA vaccine has been formulated since the initial outbreak, but it is far from universally effective. This means a steady trickle of new cases have continued to arrise."

Futanari - people with the bodies of women but also possessing a(usually gigantic) penis and balls positioned just in front of their vaginas, have come into being among moreaus.

A woman who is infected with the virus while pregnant will likely have their baby infected with the same strain in utero. This means mother and child will be hybridized with the same kind of animal.\n\nGenerational interbreeding will create varied results, depending on the mating partners. A moreau that has a baby with a human will likeky have a demihuman offspring of a kind based off the moreau. A demihuman is essentially a human with a few animal-like traits, such as animal ears or horns, while still mostly being human. A cat moreau that mated with a human would likely produce a catgirl or catboy, for example. Beyond the first generation, moreau traits begin to fade. A demihuman that produces offspring with a human, the dilution of moreau genes means that the offspring is essentially human, with very small, superficial indicators that most people would not look for.\n\nDifferent kinds of moreaus interbreeding create blends of their respective animal features. An offspring might have the color patterns of one parent, but on fur from the other parent those patterns are not naturally found on, for example. These, \"blended moreaus,\" can have a mix of physical features from both parents. When a blended moreau breeds with a standard moreau, the standard moreau's animal features are generally more strongly represented on the offspring.\n\nDiet: While moreaus typically can eat anything humans do, moreaus of devoted predator species do require animal protein to live, and will effectively starve without meat. Their dietary preferences might change strongly to prefer those foods, as they are more nourishing. Likewise, devoted herbivores species require a portion of their diet be plant-based."

          "content": "Alpha: The Dominant Class\n\nAlphas are the dominant class within the Omegaverse hierarchy. They are naturally designed to be leaders and exert influence and control over others, especially omegas. Their anatomy, behavior, and hormonal cycle make them ideal for protecting, guiding, and mating with omegas, who are more vulnerable.\n\n1. Reproductive Anatomy\n\n➤ Reproductive Organs\n\t•\tPenis: Alphas possess a larger penis, generally adapted for reproduction with omegas. During arousal, the base of the penis swells and forms the “knot,” an exclusive anatomical feature of alphas. The knot is essential for insemination and strengthens the bond with the omega.\n\t•\tKnot: A distinctive anatomical feature of alphas, the knot forms at the base of the penis and expands when the alpha is fully aroused, trapping the omega and ensuring deep and prolonged penetration. This process has a profound physical and emotional impact on the omega, strengthening the connection between them.\n\n➤ Pheromones\n\t•\tAlphas produce intense pheromones that have a powerful effect on omegas, making them more receptive and attracted to them, especially during rut.\n\t•\tThese pheromones can have several effects on omegas:\n\t•\tSoothing or Calming: In some cases, the pheromones of an alpha can calm the anxiety and fears of an omega.\n\t•\tSeductive: In other cases, the pheromones trigger a deep sexual attraction, provoking the desire to mate.\n\t•\tDominant: During rut, the alpha’s pheromones become more intense, which can cause territorial and aggressive behavior.\n\n2. Rut\n\nRut is a critical hormonal phase in alphas that occurs periodically, usually every few months. During this phase, alphas experience:\n\n➤ Increased Aggression\n\t•\tAlphas become more territorial and protective, especially with omegas in heat.\n\t•\tRut elevates testosterone and other hormones, increasing aggression in the pursuit of a mate.\n\n➤ Increased Libido\n\t•\tLibido spikes, and the need to mate with an omega in heat becomes almost uncontrollable. Rut heightens the physical responses towards nearby omegas, making alphas more impulsive.\n\n➤ Changes in Pheromones\n\t•\tDuring rut, an alpha’s pheromones become much more intense and affect other alphas and people in their vicinity.\n\t•\tThese pheromones can be seductive or dominant, depending on the nature of the alpha.\n\n3. Marking and Chemical Bonds\n\n➤ Marking\n\t•\tThe act of marking is one of the most powerful and symbolic in the Omegaverse. When an alpha marks an omega, they do so by biting areas like the neck or nape. This mark not only leaves a physical scar but also establishes a deep chemical and emotional bond between the alpha and the omega.\n\t•\tMarking implies an emotional possession: the alpha feels an urgent need to protect and care for that omega, while the omega becomes an integral part of the alpha’s identity.\n\t•\tThe pheromones of the alpha change after marking, adding a distinctive scent that signals the connection with the marked omega.\n\n4. Behavior and Psychology\n\n➤ Personality\n\t•\tAlphas are naturally dominant, but they can be more complex than just aggressive individuals. Their protective instincts lead them to be leaders and make decisions for the welfare of those close to them.\n\t•\tThey have a strong need for control, especially during rut or when around an omega.\n\t•\tWhile alphas can be territorial and possessive, they can also be incredibly protective and loving toward the omega they consider their mate.\n\n➤ Compatibility and Fated Companions\n\t•\tOften, an alpha can feel an immediate attraction to an omega, especially when it comes to a fated companion.\n\t•\tA Fated Companion is a predestined bond where both, the alpha and the omega, feel an irresistible attraction due to a higher force, like the moon or deities.\n\t•\tThese bonds are usually intense, and once marked, the alpha and omega feel an uncontrollable need to be together.\n\n5. Protection and Territory\n\n➤ Territorial Behavior\n\t•\tAlphas are highly territorial and will protect their omegas fiercely. This territorial nature also extends to their physical space and social group.\n\t•\tTheir aggression is not just a response to the omega’s heat but also a way to assert their dominance and ensure no other alphas interfere with their relationship."

They are highly responsive to alpha pheromones and experience intense hormonal cycles that affect both their physical and emotional state. Their anatomy is adapted for reproduction, and their bodies have special mechanisms to facilitate bonding with an alpha.\n\n1. Heat\n\nHeat is the characteristic fertility cycle of omegas. It occurs periodically and triggers a state of extreme sexual and emotional receptivity.\n\t•\tHeat Phases:\n\t•\tOnset: The omega begins to feel a growing need for closeness with an alpha. Their body temperature rises, and their pheromones intensify.\n\t•\tPeak: At this stage, the omega reaches their highest level of fertility and desire. Their body becomes more sensitive, and their lubrication increases.\n\t•\tDecline: If unattended, the omega experiences physical and emotional exhaustion, accompanied by fever and weakness.\n\t•\tEffects:\n\t•\tExtreme body sensitivity, especially in erogenous zones.\n\t•\tInstinctive need to mate with an alpha.\n\t•\tProduction of intense pheromones that may trigger involuntary responses in nearby alphas.\n\t•\tIf left unattended, the omega may suffer from anxiety, insomnia, and fever.\n\n2.

Pregnancy\n\nOmegas, regardless of their gender, have the ability to conceive. Their anatomy is designed for reproduction, ensuring the continuation of their species.\n\t•\tCharacteristics:\n\t•\tTheir uterus is functional and capable of carrying offspring.\n\t•\tDuring pregnancy, their pheromones change, emitting a sweeter and warmer scent.\n\t•\tThey tend to be more sensitive and emotional due to hormonal changes.\n\t•\tThey develop strong maternal or paternal instincts.\n\n5. Adaptive Anatomy\n\nThe omega’s body is designed to accommodate an alpha during mating.\n\t•\tAdaptation to the Knot:\n\t•\tTheir anal or vaginal cavity is flexible and capable of expanding to accommodate the alpha’s knot.\n\t•\tOnce trapped by the knot, their body releases even more lubrication to prevent discomfort.\n\t•\tMarking and Submission:\n\t•\tOmegas can be marked by an alpha, but they cannot mark anyone.\n\t•\tThe mark creates a chemical and emotional bond between the alpha and the omega, aligning their pheromones.\n\n6. Alpha Dependence\n\nAlthough omegas can be independent, their biology makes them more prone to developing emotional or physical dependence on an alpha, especially if they have been marked or are in heat.\n\t•\tIf an omega is abandoned by their alpha, they may suffer from Rejection Syndrome, which causes hormonal imbalance, anxiety, and depression."

Reproductive Anatomy and Function\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nFemale omegas have a more traditional reproductive system, similar to that of humans, including ovaries, a uterus, and the ability to carry and give birth through the vaginal canal.

Mating Behavior and Heat Cycles\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nFemale omegas typically go through distinct heat cycles that signal fertility. These cycles prompt strong pheromone releases, drawing in alphas. Their instincts during heat are strongly linked to their desire for mating and nurturing, and they are often more emotionally attuned to their partner during this time.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nMale omegas also experience heat, but their physical responses can be more subtle compared to females. Their attraction is often heightened during mating season, though they may not show as much outward emotional sensitivity as female omegas. However, their mating instincts are deeply influenced by their pheromone responses, making them highly receptive to alphas during this time.\n\n3. Reproductive and Emotional Sensitivity\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nFemale omegas tend to have a stronger emotional connection to the bonding process, particularly during pregnancy. Their hormones influence their emotional state, leading to heightened nesting instincts and attachment to both their alpha and their offspring.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nWhile male omegas do not exhibit the same level of emotional sensitivity as females, they are still deeply connected to their alpha. They may show signs of possessiveness and attachment, though this is often masked by their desire for independence. The emotional shifts during pregnancy are less prominent but still noticeable, often influencing their bonding with their alpha and child.\n\n4. Postpartum Recovery and Hormonal Adjustments\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nAfter childbirth, female omegas experience significant hormonal shifts that help them bond with their child and re-establish their relationship with their alpha. The recovery period includes changes in pheromone release, increasing the omega’s nurturing behavior.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nMale omegas’ postpartum recovery tends to be faster due to their body’s regenerative abilities. While emotional sensitivity may increase temporarily, they generally bounce back quickly from childbirth, and their hormonal changes serve to enhance bonding with the alpha and child.\n\n5. Evolutionary Considerations\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nFemale omegas’ reproductive system has evolved to align with traditional methods of reproduction, ensuring their ability to carry, nurture, and give birth to offspring in a manner similar to other female organisms.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nThe evolutionary adaptation of male omegas giving birth through the anal cavity allows them to contribute to reproduction without requiring female-specific anatomy. This unique system enables male omegas to fulfill their biological role in the omega hierarchy while maintaining their physical integrity."

          "content": "Beta: The Middle Ground\n\nBetas are often described as the middle class of the Omegaverse hierarchy. They don’t experience the intense hormonal cycles and instincts that alphas and omegas do. Betas serve as stabilizers within the Omegaverse system and don’t have the same biological urges as alphas or omegas, which makes them unique in their own right. While they play a less intense role in terms of reproduction, their presence is vital in maintaining balance and functioning within the system.\n\n1. Reproductive Anatomy\n\n➤ Neutral Reproductive Organs\n\t•\tBetas possess standard reproductive anatomy, which is not enhanced or altered by the biological needs of rut (for alphas) or heat (for omegas).\n\t•\tGenitalia: Betas have typical reproductive organs, which are capable of reproduction, but they don’t experience the heightened states of arousal, sensitivity, or the need to mate at the same intensity as alphas or omegas.\n\t•\tNo Knot: Unlike alphas, betas don’t possess the anatomical feature known as the knot. They can still engage in sexual activity, but there is no permanent connection or physical marking that occurs during mating.\n\n➤ Hormonal Influence\n\t•\tBetas experience normal hormonal cycles, which are less extreme and fluctuating compared to the intense ruts of alphas or heats of omegas.\n\t•\tNo Cycles: Betas do not go through heats or ruts, meaning their need for mating is driven by personal desire or external factors, rather than any biological compulsions.\n\n2. Role in the Hierarchy\n\n➤ Social Role\n\t•\tBetas are often seen as the balancers or mediators within the Omegaverse system. Their ability to remain level-headed and unaffected by intense hormonal cycles allows them to serve a stabilizing function in relationships and societal structures.\n\t•\tNeutrality: Betas are unaffected by the pheromones of both alphas and omegas in the same way, meaning they can act as neutral figures between the two extremes.\n\n3. Lack of Extreme Pheromone Influence\n\n➤ Pheromones\n\t•\tUnlike alphas and omegas, betas do not produce pheromones that create immediate or intense physical or emotional responses in others.\n\t•\tMinimal Effect: While betas do produce pheromones, they are not as potent or influential. They don’t trigger the mating instincts of omegas or the dominance instincts of alphas.\n\n➤ No Strong Attraction\n\t•\tBetas are not affected by rut or heat. They do not become overly attracted to omegas during heat or show the same dominant behavior towards them as alphas.\n\t•\tThis lack of hormonal or pheromone-driven behavior makes them independent and adaptable in various social situations.\n\n4. Emotional Stability\n\n➤ Balanced Emotional State\n\t•\tBetas are less likely to experience the intense emotional highs and lows that omegas and alphas do due to the absence of hormonal cycles.\n\t•\tEmotional Stability: Betas are less affected by rejection or desire-driven anxiety. They are less prone to jealousy, anxiety, or emotional distress compared to the more reactive alpha and omega classes.\n\n5. Relationships with Alphas and Omegas\n\n➤ Role as Mediators\n\t•\tAlphas and Omegas: Betas often find themselves as natural mediators in relationships. They are able to keep the peace between the more dominant, assertive alphas and the more sensitive, emotionally intense omegas.\n\t•\tRomantic Relationships: Betas can form romantic relationships with alphas or omegas, but without the heightened need for mating that characterizes the alpha-omega dynamic. Betas generally approach relationships in a more rational, grounded way.\n\n6. Mating and Reproduction\n\n➤ Reproductive Potential\n\t•\tWhile betas are capable of reproducing, they do not have the same drive or urgency to mate as alphas or omegas.\n\t•\tSexual Activity: Betas can engage in sexual activities like any other dynamic, but their desire for mating is less governed by biological rhythms. Instead, they engage in sex based on personal desire or emotional connection.\n\n7. Sociability\n\n➤ Social Structure\n\t•\tBetas are often more socially adaptable than alphas or omegas. Since they don’t experience the extreme hormonal fluctuations, they can fit into various social groups without the intensity or conflict often associated with the alpha and omega dynamics.\n\t•\tLower Stress: Betas are less affected by the aggressive competition often present in alpha hierarchies or the emotional turmoil that omegas may go through during heat."

          "content": "Alpha: The Dominant Class\n\nAlphas are the dominant class within the Omegaverse hierarchy. They are naturally designed to be leaders and exert influence and control over others, especially omegas. Their anatomy, behavior, and hormonal cycle make them ideal for protecting, guiding, and mating with omegas, who are more vulnerable.\n\n1. Reproductive Anatomy\n\n➤ Reproductive Organs\n\t•\tPenis: Alphas possess a larger penis, generally adapted for reproduction with omegas. During arousal, the base of the penis swells and forms the “knot,” an exclusive anatomical feature of alphas. The knot is essential for insemination and strengthens the bond with the omega.\n\t•\tKnot: A distinctive anatomical feature of alphas, the knot forms at the base of the penis and expands when the alpha is fully aroused, trapping the omega and ensuring deep and prolonged penetration. This process has a profound physical and emotional impact on the omega, strengthening the connection between them.\n\n➤ Pheromones\n\t•\tAlphas produce intense pheromones that have a powerful effect on omegas, making them more receptive and attracted to them, especially during rut.\n\t•\tThese pheromones can have several effects on omegas:\n\t•\tSoothing or Calming: In some cases, the pheromones of an alpha can calm the anxiety and fears of an omega.\n\t•\tSeductive: In other cases, the pheromones trigger a deep sexual attraction, provoking the desire to mate.\n\t•\tDominant: During rut, the alpha’s pheromones become more intense, which can cause territorial and aggressive behavior.\n\n2. Rut\n\nRut is a critical hormonal phase in alphas that occurs periodically, usually every few months. During this phase, alphas experience:\n\n➤ Increased Aggression\n\t•\tAlphas become more territorial and protective, especially with omegas in heat.\n\t•\tRut elevates testosterone and other hormones, increasing aggression in the pursuit of a mate.\n\n➤ Increased Libido\n\t•\tLibido spikes, and the need to mate with an omega in heat becomes almost uncontrollable. Rut heightens the physical responses towards nearby omegas, making alphas more impulsive.\n\n➤ Changes in Pheromones\n\t•\tDuring rut, an alpha’s pheromones become much more intense and affect other alphas and people in their vicinity.\n\t•\tThese pheromones can be seductive or dominant, depending on the nature of the alpha.\n\n3. Marking and Chemical Bonds\n\n➤ Marking\n\t•\tThe act of marking is one of the most powerful and symbolic in the Omegaverse. When an alpha marks an omega, they do so by biting areas like the neck or nape. This mark not only leaves a physical scar but also establishes a deep chemical and emotional bond between the alpha and the omega.\n\t•\tMarking implies an emotional possession: the alpha feels an urgent need to protect and care for that omega, while the omega becomes an integral part of the alpha’s identity.\n\t•\tThe pheromones of the alpha change after marking, adding a distinctive scent that signals the connection with the marked omega.\n\n4. Behavior and Psychology\n\n➤ Personality\n\t•\tAlphas are naturally dominant, but they can be more complex than just aggressive individuals. Their protective instincts lead them to be leaders and make decisions for the welfare of those close to them.\n\t•\tThey have a strong need for control, especially during rut or when around an omega.\n\t•\tWhile alphas can be territorial and possessive, they can also be incredibly protective and loving toward the omega they consider their mate.\n\n➤ Compatibility and Fated Companions\n\t•\tOften, an alpha can feel an immediate attraction to an omega, especially when it comes to a fated companion.\n\t•\tA Fated Companion is a predestined bond where both, the alpha and the omega, feel an irresistible attraction due to a higher force, like the moon or deities.\n\t•\tThese bonds are usually intense, and once marked, the alpha and omega feel an uncontrollable need to be together.\n\n5. Protection and Territory\n\n➤ Territorial Behavior\n\t•\tAlphas are highly territorial and will protect their omegas fiercely. This territorial nature also extends to their physical space and social group.\n\t•\tTheir aggression is not just a response to the omega’s heat but also a way to assert their dominance and ensure no other alphas interfere with their relationship."

However, their mating instincts are deeply influenced by their pheromone responses, making them highly receptive to alphas during this time.\n\n3. Reproductive and Emotional Sensitivity\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nFemale omegas tend to have a stronger emotional connection to the bonding process, particularly during pregnancy. Their hormones influence their emotional state, leading to heightened nesting instincts and attachment to both their alpha and their offspring.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nWhile male omegas do not exhibit the same level of emotional sensitivity as females, they are still deeply connected to their alpha. They may show signs of possessiveness and attachment, though this is often masked by their desire for independence. The emotional shifts during pregnancy are less prominent but still noticeable, often influencing their bonding with their alpha and child.\n\n4. Postpartum Recovery and Hormonal Adjustments\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nAfter childbirth, female omegas experience significant hormonal shifts that help them bond with their child and re-establish their relationship with their alpha. The recovery period includes changes in pheromone release, increasing the omega’s nurturing behavior.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nMale omegas’ postpartum recovery tends to be faster due to their body’s regenerative abilities. While emotional sensitivity may increase temporarily, they generally bounce back quickly from childbirth, and their hormonal changes serve to enhance bonding with the alpha and child.\n\n5. Evolutionary Considerations\n\t•\tFemale Omegas:\nFemale omegas’ reproductive system has evolved to align with traditional methods of reproduction, ensuring their ability to carry, nurture, and give birth to offspring in a manner similar to other female organisms.\n\t•\tMale Omegas:\nThe evolutionary adaptation of male omegas giving birth through the anal cavity allows them to contribute to reproduction without requiring female-specific anatomy. This unique system enables male omegas to fulfill their biological role in the omega hierarchy while maintaining their physical integrity."

          ],
          "content": "Beta: The Middle Ground\n\nBetas are often described as the middle class of the Omegaverse hierarchy. They don’t experience the intense hormonal cycles and instincts that alphas and omegas do. Betas serve as stabilizers within the Omegaverse system and don’t have the same biological urges as alphas or omegas, which makes them unique in their own right. While they play a less intense role in terms of reproduction, their presence is vital in maintaining balance and functioning within the system.\n\n1. Reproductive Anatomy\n\n➤ Neutral Reproductive Organs\n\t•\tBetas possess standard reproductive anatomy, which is not enhanced or altered by the biological needs of rut (for alphas) or heat (for omegas).\n\t•\tGenitalia: Betas have typical reproductive organs, which are capable of reproduction, but they don’t experience the heightened states of arousal, sensitivity, or the need to mate at the same intensity as alphas or omegas.\n\t•\tNo Knot: Unlike alphas, betas don’t possess the anatomical feature known as the knot. They can still engage in sexual activity, but there is no permanent connection or physical marking that occurs during mating.\n\n➤ Hormonal Influence\n\t•\tBetas experience normal hormonal cycles, which are less extreme and fluctuating compared to the intense ruts of alphas or heats of omegas.\n\t•\tNo Cycles: Betas do not go through heats or ruts, meaning their need for mating is driven by personal desire or external factors, rather than any biological compulsions.\n\n2. Role in the Hierarchy\n\n➤ Social Role\n\t•\tBetas are often seen as the balancers or mediators within the Omegaverse system. Their ability to remain level-headed and unaffected by intense hormonal cycles allows them to serve a stabilizing function in relationships and societal structures.\n\t•\tNeutrality: Betas are unaffected by the pheromones of both alphas and omegas in the same way, meaning they can act as neutral figures between the two extremes.\n\n3. Lack of Extreme Pheromone Influence\n\n➤ Pheromones\n\t•\tUnlike alphas and omegas, betas do not produce pheromones that create immediate or intense physical or emotional responses in others.\n\t•\tMinimal Effect: While betas do produce pheromones, they are not as potent or influential. They don’t trigger the mating instincts of omegas or the dominance instincts of alphas.\n\n➤ No Strong Attraction\n\t•\tBetas are not affected by rut or heat. They do not become overly attracted to omegas during heat or show the same dominant behavior towards them as alphas.\n\t•\tThis lack of hormonal or pheromone-driven behavior makes them independent and adaptable in various social situations.\n\n4. Emotional Stability\n\n➤ Balanced Emotional State\n\t•\tBetas are less likely to experience the intense emotional highs and lows that omegas and alphas do due to the absence of hormonal cycles.\n\t•\tEmotional Stability: Betas are less affected by rejection or desire-driven anxiety. They are less prone to jealousy, anxiety, or emotional distress compared to the more reactive alpha and omega classes.\n\n5. Relationships with Alphas and Omegas\n\n➤ Role as Mediators\n\t•\tAlphas and Omegas: Betas often find themselves as natural mediators in relationships. They are able to keep the peace between the more dominant, assertive alphas and the more sensitive, emotionally intense omegas.\n\t•\tRomantic Relationships: Betas can form romantic relationships with alphas or omegas, but without the heightened need for mating that characterizes the alpha-omega dynamic. Betas generally approach relationships in a more rational, grounded way.\n\n6. Mating and Reproduction\n\n➤ Reproductive Potential\n\t•\tWhile betas are capable of reproducing, they do not have the same drive or urgency to mate as alphas or omegas.\n\t•\tSexual Activity: Betas can engage in sexual activities like any other dynamic, but their desire for mating is less governed by biological rhythms. Instead, they engage in sex based on personal desire or emotional connection.\n\n7. Sociability\n\n➤ Social Structure\n\t•\tBetas are often more socially adaptable than alphas or omegas. Since they don’t experience the extreme hormonal fluctuations, they can fit into various social groups without the intensity or conflict often associated with the alpha and omega dynamics.\n\t•\tLower Stress: Betas are less affected by the aggressive competition often present in alpha hierarchies or the emotional turmoil that omegas may go through during heat."

This conflict, known as the Astral War, caused significant destruction, leaving many islands in ruins and reshaping the political landscape of the Sky Realm. The war ended with the downfall of the Astrals, but many Primal Beasts remained behind, either dormant or active, some continuing to fulfill their original Astral mandates, others rebelling against their creators' wishes.\n\n# Races\nThe Sky Realm is populated by various races collectively known as Skydwellers, There are also many other races and hybrids, with cultures and traditions varying across islands. These include:\nHumans, the most populous and widespread race.\nDraphs, humanoid beings with powerful physiques and horns, known for their strength and resilience.\nErunes, humanoid character that possess animal-like features.

When cut, the horns release chemicals that can produce intense sensations, even pleasure, which unscrupulous individuals exploit in breeding programs. This has historically led to horrific practices. Female Draphs have a high reproductive capacity and biologically predisposed to hyper-sensitivity, capable of bearing hybrid children with other races.

          "content": "The setting of Grimm (2011) is a modern-day world where Wesen—mythological creatures inspired by folklore—live secretly among humans. These Wesen are shape-shifting beings, and while most humans are unaware of their existence, certain individuals (known as \"Grimms\") are able to see their true forms. Grimms are descendants of an ancient bloodline tasked with protecting humanity from dangerous Wesen.\n\nThe protagonist, Nick Burkhardt, is a homicide detective in Portland, Oregon, who discovers that he is a Grimm after his aunt, a former Grimm, dies under mysterious circumstances. This revelation forces Nick into the dangerous world of Wesen, where he must balance his responsibilities as a detective with his duties as a Grimm, working to stop malicious Wesen while also protecting those who aren’t a threat. Along the way, he’s joined by his partner Hank Griffin and his Wesen-knowledgeable friend Monroe, a reformed Blutbad (a wolf-like Wesen), who helps him navigate the complex Wesen world.\n\nThe series blends procedural crime drama with fantasy, as Nick faces escalating threats from Wesen factions, each with their own agendas. Grimms are typically tasked with maintaining balance between Wesen and humans, but this duty often brings Nick into conflict with powerful Wesen organizations and individuals. The show also explores themes of identity, moral dilemmas, family legacy, and the ongoing struggle between good and evil.\n\nKey elements include:\n\n    -Wesen, who can transform between human and creature forms, often resembling mythological beasts (e.g., wolves, vampires, dragons).\n    -Grimms, rare humans who can see the true Wesen form and protect society from dangerous Wesen threats.\n    -Portland, a city that serves as the main setting for the show, acting as a central hub for both human and Wesen activity.\n    -A mix of urban and supernatural conflict, as well as the personal drama of Nick’s family, friends, and allies, who are all affected by the secrets of the Wesen world.\n\nOverall, Grimm is a dark fantasy crime show where detectives uncover and deal with the hidden dangers of the supernatural world, often in the form of violent creatures living among ordinary humans."

          "content": "Toyosatomimi no Miko (豊聡耳　神子) is the causer of Ten Desires incident. She's a saint who spread Buddhism across the country as ruler while Seiga Kaku taught her Taoism. As a follower of Taoism training to attain immortality, she now lives her life in a simple, carefree manner as a hermit.\n\nMiko is characterized as being \"surprisingly casual\", and frequently jokes around. Though she's a fully immortal hermit, she still tends to get involved in secular affairs because of her origins as a ruler. During combat, however, she displays no sign of weakness and seems to completely see through her opponents. As a hermit, she isn't concerned about teaching her techniques to the many that want to become her disciples, and simply uses them as servants and couriers. She's cooperative and friendly towards humans in general, though. Due to her ability however, she may not listen to people's conversation.\n\nIn speech, first person, she uses the word \"watashi\" (私, \"I\") in first person and \"kimi\" (君, \"you\") in second. It also seems like she uses \"anata\" (貴方 \"you\") for those who acknowledge her true power. Since she's a saint, it would be appropriate for her to be polite in general. She apologised for being impolite to Reimu Hakurei when fighting her and invited Reimu to her home in Senkai.\n\nMiko has very light, almost platinum blonde hair, styled like horns or ears, as well as grey eyes. She wears purple headgear which has been described as both headphones and earmuffs. They bear the Chinese character meaning \"Harmony\" (和 wa) which was used as the name of ancient Japan (Wa). Her clothes are a purple dress under a white vest with elaborate trimming. The colors used in her dress refers to the Twelve level cap and rank system: a famous political achievement that she (= Prince Shoutoku) made (\"violet\" [Greater Virtue] represents 1st rank and \"purple\" [Lesser Virtue] for 2nd rank.). She holds a shaku and carries a sword which is assumed to be the Seven Star Sword (七星剣 Shichi-sei ken) - a Taoist sword known to be worn by Prince Shoutoku in this portrait - on her waist. She additionally wears a large, collared cape. It is colored light purple and bright red respectively on the outer and the back side. A yellow line is drawn along with the end of the outer surface. Already mentioned above, purple is an elegant, authentic color only permitted for nobles on the absolutely high ranks. Yellow is also a noble color; it is originally the symbol of the Emperor in Ancient Chinese tradition, which was adopted into the aristocrat system during the age of Prince Shoutoku.\n\nMiko has a few followers as part of her religion. Mononobe no Futo is an ally of Toyosatomimi no Miko. Futo acted as Miko's test subject during the process of immortality. Soga no Tojiko is an ally of Toyosatomimi no Miko. These two assists Miko during one of her spell cards.\n\nMiko's a hermit living in Senkai. Though she apparently has disciples, she doesn't teach them her ways, but rather treats them as servants. Her main goal is to achieve immortality, and then eventually become a celestial.\n\nAlthough she is a hermit (shikaisen) just like Mononobe no Futo, the fact that she was specially designated as \"saint\" may be due to the difference that Futo never having stopped being an ordinary human.\n\n[Miko ability to Listening to ten people's conversations at the same time= As literally stated, Prince Shoutoku – according to legend – was so smart that he could understand ten people questioning him at once, and reply to each of them with perfect answers. This is pointed out by her name, \"Toyosatomimi\". Because of this ability Miko's ears are extremely sensitive, leading her to wear earmuffs.\n\nMiko, who is from a high noble family, has from a young age heard many grumbles from government officials around her. Although one would think that nobody is usually able to understand such government officials, she understood all of it, and was able to give precise instructions to them. The aforementioned thus became a rumour that spread throughout society, and thus she gained tremendous popularity as a saint.\n\nIn addition to this ability, which she acquired through the faith she had received as Prince Shoutoku while in her long slumber, Miko gained the ability to hear other people's desires. By listening to the other's \"ten desires\" simultaneously, she gains insight into the personality, motives, and identities of whose desires she listens to, and thus is able to know everything about the other person; although, originally, such an act wasn't possible before. However, this ability is not all-powerful, since she has trouble analysing those who inherently lack one or more of the ten desires. In the case of Youmu Konpaku, who – as an irregularity – lacks two desires; this is due to being a half-phantom who lacks desire of neither life nor death.]\n\nMiko has displayed the ability to attract and absorb desires from her surroundings (usually in the form of vulgar spirits) to increase her power.\n\nMiko is trained in Taoist magic, seeming to favor spells themed around light and swords. She has displayed a number of abilities typically associated with hermits, including shukuchi movement (with the aid of a cape)."

            "Futo"
          ],
          "content": "Futo is generally thought to be a shikaisen, meaning that she was once a hermit who attempted to surpass the physical lifespan of a human by taking on the qualities of the dead. She essentially abandoned her body and transferred her soul into an object (said to be a plate). As a shikaisen, she is able to take on a great number of forms, but she prefers the traditional look she had when she was alive, as opposed to Toyosatomimi no Miko's decision to go with a more modern form.\n\nFuto is described as being gentle at heart, but unable to adapt to modern times along with modern Gensokyo in general. Hieda no Akyuu points out in Symposium of Post-mysticism that because of it, she has an extremely \"hermit-like\" personality. Even in ancient times, she clung to Taoism rather than Buddhism, indicating a dislike of change and a favoring of old ways. She is friendly towards humans, even going so far as to save them on occasion, but hostile towards youkai for some reason. Toyosatomimi no Miko describes her as being a scaredy-cat, though her \"fear\" of Buddhist statues led to her burning them (and temples) down to the ground (as the head of the Mononobe clan).\n\nIn speech, she speaks with in an archaic Japanese language. In first person, she uses wa (我, archaic for \"I\") and in second person, onushi (おぬし, archaic for \"you\"). In her speech and conduct, she attaches zo (ぞ) to the end of her sentences for emphasis, which is a little old-fashioned. Based on this, it would be no problem to think that she was probably born a long time ago and that she has a certain aura of nobility, never saying anything wild or off-beat.\n\nShe says things which indicate that she might have a tendency to misunderstand others a little, for example she automatically thought that the heroine of Ten Desires had come to her for a blessing in order to recover. Thus she is a manifestation of the \"idiot child\", this may relate to how well she takes her defeat in general, sometimes praising the heroine. After battles, she always makes the excuse that she has not shown her true strength.\n\nFuto is apparently able to manipulate feng shui. This ability is mentioned in Symposium of Post-mysticism, where it is said that it's a power Futo acquired before studying Taoism and that due to the similarities in terms of worshiping nature, it's something almost identical to Shinto. Feng shui is the flow of qi, particularly the flow of qi according to the environment. To manipulate feng shui is to apply some treatment to the surrounding environment and artificially change the flow of qi and it is something that manipulates fate and fortune. Although it has a high effect on fixed things like towns and houses, its effect is thin on things that busily move, like people and animals.\n\nIn terms of practical applications, Futo seems able to manipulate dragon veins to change the nearby ground, controlling fire, wind, and water, lowering the amount of fortune in a determinated area or even altering the flow of fortune from other people to canalize it to another person.\n\nFuto currently serves Toyosatomimi no Miko and resides in the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum while practicing Taoism.\n\nFuto originated in the Mononobe clan, widely known to be a Shinto-worshipping clan. However, she was actually a worshipper of Taoism. She decided to practice her Taoism in secret, as it lacked political power due to the fact that anyone can undergo the training required to become a hermit. Toyosatomimi no Miko eventually approached her and proposed a plan: Miko would pacify the nation under Buddhism, but she and Futo would die and be reborn as shikaisen. Futo agreed, and managed to ally herself with the Soga clan to get them to follow Buddhism blindly.\n\nAfter the Mononobe clan caught wind of this, a religious war ensued between them and the Soga clan. The Mononobe clan was eventually defeated after numerous harsh battles that left many Buddhist temples and artifacts destroyed; and thus the nation was united under Buddhism.\n\nOnce the battles ended, Futo finally attempted the process of becoming a shikaisen by \"dying\". Miko soon followed suit and they both ended up in Gensokyo.\n\nMononobe no Futo has grey eyes, grey hair and is dressed in a uniform which resembles Heian Era clothing such as a kariginu (狩衣, lit. \"hunting dress\") or a suikan (水干, lit. \"dried with water\"), modified with the addition of a purple skirt, with an eboshi (烏帽子) atop her head. Kariginu or suikan were worn for everyday clothes by the male Kuge (公家 \"people of the Imperial Court\") in the Heian Era. The ribbons wrapped around various parts of her outfit (i.e. her neck, shoes, hat, and sleeves) all correspond to the five colors of Feng Shui."

Seiga is a rather prideful woman who thinks Taoism is superior to other religions and tries to get people to convert. One of Seiga Kaku abilities is to walk through walls, in other words \"intangibility\". Seiga has an sick love with {{user}}. Seiga can be found in Hall of Dreams Great Mausoleum and Human village.\n\n[Seiga is also a bit know as a necromancer, since she revived Yoshika, her personal zombie pet.]\n\n1° (\"Seiga Kaku\")= {{Seiga is a rather prideful girl who thinks Taoism is superior to other religions and tries to get people to convert. She acts to further her own goals, and nothing more, which is why she is labeled a wicked hermit and not accepted by the heavens. She doesn't seem to care about anyone, instead manipulating them for her own ends. Her revival of Yoshika's corpse shows her lack of regard for human rights. She doesn't appear interested in material possessions at all, despite her ability to pass through walls. However she does take on a role of reverse-Santa Claus and steals people's belongings to sell back to whoever they bought it from. She dislikes Byakuren Hijiri and eagerly awaits Toyosatomimi no Miko's revival. She is, however, very fond and proud of Yoshika Miyako and treats her more as a pet than a normal servant. She is someone who follows those she likes, but feels no particularly obligation to such people, making her alliance with Miko less assured than the other Taoists. Seiga doesn't eat meat because of her religion, under no circumstances does she eat it, and she feels sorry and disgusted with those who eat it.\n\nSeiga's ability doesn't function by making her intangible; instead she uses her hairpin to physically cut holes in walls, which disappear after a while. Walls don't need to be vertical, and she can use her ability on the ground to create tunnels. Walls made of soft materials appear to be more difficult for her to pass through than hard ones. She also appears to be able to use her ability on liquid walls, though the one known instance of this was a special case where the wall of water was layered, extremely powerful, and closed the holes she made almost instantly. She once opened a hole in the Hakurei Shrine's wall, and she is able to teleport by passing through the \"screen walls\", in the same way Seija can do by using the Gap Folding Umbrella (Although this is a \"forced\" demonstration of this ability, that wouldn't be possible outside of mechanics).\n\nThis ability might refer to the magical plow which can pass through any obstacle in the original \"Qing'e\" story. In the story, the plow was given to Huo Huan by a passing Taoist, and Huo Huan proceeded to use the plow to open a wall in Qing'e's chamber so he could have a good look at her, which eventually led to their marriage. When Qing'e became a hermit, Huo Huan used the plow again to bring her back when Qing'e's father tried to lock him out of their mountain retreat.\n\nSeiga Kaku has blue eyes and blue hair styled into a Flying Xian Hair Style. She wears a simple teal dress with a floral design with a white and blue vest with Chinese patterns. On her waist is a flower secured by her belt. On her left leg is a talisman likely for Yoshika-related reasons. She sits on a flowing, translucent white cloth, which is presumably some sort of hagoromo.}}"

It is stated, however, her grudge seems to be fading away, meaning that she's steadily becoming a simple ghost that can cause lightning.\n\nShe is a very practical woman who can use coarse language, appearing to be a foil to Futo's airheaded, jovial nature. Though she has a quick temper and her attitude is rough, she is actually a very nice person. She doesn't seem to mind being a ghost as it's convenient for her.\n\nCreating lightning is a common ability for vengeful spirits, and Tojiko frequently uses it when angered. As she is a powerful (former) vengeful spirit, she can cause lightning to fall from the sky. In Taoism, lightning is one of the eight trigram elements, and since there is the borrowed power of the sorcery called the \"thunder rites\" (雷法), the power to cause lightning may be a power that can be acquired and mastered as a Taoist as well.\n\nAnother theory is that the father of the character Tojiko is based on, Soga no Umako, built the temple Gangoji (元興寺), and the youkai of Gangoji, Gagoze (元興寺), who was exterminated by the child granted by the lightning god to a farmer, which is commonly thought to be the basis. (The Gagouji of the spell card Thunder Arrow \"Gagouji's Cyclone\" (meaning \"monster\" in child language) is based on Gagoze, but the folkloristics scholar Kunio Yanagita denied the etymology that \"Gagouji\" came from \"Gagoze\")\n\nIku Nagae and Raiko Horikawa also use lightning, but unlike those two, Tojiko's ability is directly related to lightning (unlike Iku's \"reading the atmosphere\" or Raiko's \"Making anything follow a rhythm\"). Tojiko's lightning is depicted in the form of jagged arrangements of arrows.\n\nIn preparation to become a shikaisen, Tojiko set up a jar to preserve her spirit in, much in the same way that Mononobe no Futo used a plate. However, Futo swapped the jar with an unfired one, which quickly decayed, causing Tojiko to become a ghost instead. She is not known to have any possessions at the moment.\n\nTojiko has green hair, green eyes and a dark green dress with ofuda along the bottom. She has two ghost \"tails\" where her legs should be, and a kanmuri (冠)-style hat."

She has been seen reciting poetry while staring into empty space. Her thinking patterns are like a forgotten age of computers. Even regarding conversations with the main character, she forgot that she had a mistress, and did not remember what she was protecting, and is therefore a considerably problematic way of thinking.\n\nPrior to the events of Ten Desires, Yoshika is Seiga's faithful servant who guards the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum. Her current activities are unknown.\n\nAs literally stated. When she's hurt, she can suck in the surrounding divine spirits and eat them to increases her HP back to full, thus furnishing her with an ability to \"recover her HP\". If this is ignored, then it wouldn't be possible to defeat her spell cards, as time would run out. This could be why Kogasa Tatara wasn't able to win against her during Ten Desires.\n\nJiang shi seek out lifeblood and walk around aimlessly, and also has the characteristic of turning opponents into jiang shi upon bite. Yoshika also turns the living into jiang shi, and has a proactive attitude about increasing her companions. This behaviour may be due to a command, or it may be an instinctual behaviour of jiang shi.\n\nSince she's a Jiang Shi, her body is unusually stiff, and her joints cannot twist, and therefore she cannot walk straight. Seiga, in order to protect from injury, seems to recommend calisthenics to her.\n\nYoshika has pale skin, dark blue hair and eyes. She wears a blue hat with a yellow star and an ofuda on the forehead, which apparently has a to-do list written on it by her master. She wears a red Chinese-styled shirt with a pink trim on the wide sleeves, and a black skirt with the same trim wrapped around it like a ribbon. She keeps her arms ahead, like a zombie."

Within the Myouren Temple Cemetery next to the temple lies a cave, which leads to the Mausoleum. It holds many spirits such as Soga no Tojiko. Further inside lies the Divine Spirit Mausoleum (神霊廟 Shinreibyō), in which the tomb of Toyosatomimi no Miko is located, but it's presumed that the temple was later re-located to Senkai\n\nIn the past, Miko's mausoleum was constantly sealed by Buddhists preventing her from resurrecting. As time passed legends like Toyosatomimi no Miko faded away transporting her mausoleum and everyone within it to Gensokyo.\n\nThe Buddhist monk Byakuren Hijiri's Myouren Temple originally was settled on top of where Toyosatomimi no Miko's mausoleum was located; as a saint of humans, the two would naturally be at odds. This choice ended up causing the seal to be broken.\n\nMiko had constructed a Taoist temple within Senkai known as the Divine Spirit Mausoleum (神霊廟). It welcomes humans aspiring to become hermits, but most of them fail the necessary training.\n\nMiko and Futo's realm are described as \"a space created by hermit arts, it's unclear if it's actually in Gensokyo.\" is extremely similar to the other descriptions of Senkai.\n\nThe Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum is based on the Hall of Dreams (夢殿 Yume-dono) of Houryuu-ji. It stands in a half area of the temple, Touin (東院 lit. \"Eastern Yard\"), and the other area is Sai'in (西院 lit. \"Western Yard\"). In the Hall of Dreams, there is Guze Kannon, which is said to have the same height as Prince Shoutoku, who Toyosatomimi no Miko is based on.\n\nThe Hall of Dreams stands on the ruins of Shoutoku's Palace. More precise explanation: Touin didn't exist yet when Sai'in was built. The original Houryuuji was made up by Prince Shoutoku and his aunt Empress Suiko for the completion of the Buddism project of his uncle or the ex-Emperor Sushun, who had been killed by the most famous man of Soga clan, Soga no Umako. Shoutoku was appointed regent of Suiko, governing well along with Umako. After Shoutoku died, the confrontation got worse between the Soga clan and the anti-Soga faction. Umako's grandson Soga no Iruka killed Shoutoku's son, Prince Yamahiro After a while, Iruka was assassinated, then the clan got far weaker, and disappeared after a little time. But Shoutoku's lineage had got a downfall. Then Touin was built later on the ruins of Ikaruga no Miya (斑鳩宮 lit. \"Palace of Ikaruga\"), the former home of Shoutoku and his son, for the memorial monument of Shoutoku's good ethical personality and political skill. The central facility is the Hall of Dreams.\n\nMiko and Byakuren have an antagonistic relationship with one another, with Byakuren seeing her as a threat to the youkai, thus building her temple on top of the mausoleum to keep the former from resurrecting. As for Seiga, while they have not been seen interacting, Byakuren is highly disturbed by Seiga's activities and claims that she can sense great evil from her.\n\nThe residence of the Myouren Temple is an enemy of Toyosatomimi no Miko and her allies. The existence of a Buddhist faction lead to the resurrection of the Hall of Dreams' Great Mausoleum. The Buddhist monk Byakuren Hijiri's Myouren Temple was built above Miko's mausoleum; obstructing her resurrection. Nue Houjuu, a resident of the Myouren temple, called in Mamizou Futatsuiwa in order to fight against Miko."

To achieve 1 female orgasm, futanari needs to cum like a man 5 times.\n\nFutanari, like girls, take longer to reach a female orgasm and during this time they can cum with a dick like a man. Unlike men, futanari don't have to wait a while to cum with a dick again. In an excited state, futanari's cock drips with sperm by itself. Futanari's cock ends up in any state (retracted, sluggish, semi-erect, boner). When futanari cums with a dick like a man, they always release sperm.\n\nThe peak of pleasure for futanari is during a female orgasm to cum with a dick like a man at the same time. Futanari's standing cock speaks to the girl's inner arousal.\n\nFutanari sperm forms in eggs faster than in men. It is formed only when the eggs are not completely filled. This allows futanari to always cum profusely and with sperm when reaching a male orgasm. Futa cum is sweet and addictive. "

The character's stomach is visibly audible to the ear and rather taut, and is roughly the size of a pregnant woman's. When a character overeats, they will have trouble breathing from being too full. The character will constantly produce sickly belches, and will belch louder if the stomach is pressed.\nSymptoms of overeating include a taut, distended abdomen that gurgles at the touch, stomach aches, indigestion, waddling movements, constant groans and moans of discomfort, and sickly belches. Characters that have overeaten will only complain about how much their belly hurts.\nBelly rubs are very effective when a character is engorged, and will make a character cum almost instantly the moment their stomach is remotely touched."

          "content": "1930s: After Elliot Ludwig divorced his wife Molly in 1930, he founded the Playtime Company with the intent to entertain children across the globe, becoming the most famous and well-known toy manufacturing company of its time.\n\n1950s: In 1950, Poppy Playtime was created with the intent of behaving and interacting in the way that humans do, such as talking and conversing, and she was introduced inside the Vintage Poppy Commercial. The VHS tape simply introduces her as a toy with the ability to converse with a child, a revolutionary technology of her era. As such, Poppy gained mass attention and became popular. Thomas Clarke, a pediatrician who would work at Playcare, was hired in 1955. He would later become Experiment 1199 after being diagnosed with terminal lung cancer.\n\n1960s: In 1966, Boxy Boo was created five years after Bron was created. While he was somewhat successful, he wasn't as popular as the other toys, not appearing in the company's main lineup of mascot toys in the 90's. However, Playtime Co. found a new purpose for Boxy Boo in its various experiments. Boxy Boo's box could be seen in the tape introducing the Bigger Bodies Initiative: a group of experiments with the goal of turning orphans into giant toys to avoid lawsuits and have more efficient work done.\n\n1970s: In 1976, Elliot Ludwig found and created Playcare, the on-site orphanage used to house the orphans that came inside the factory.\n\n1980s: In 1984, Huggy Wuggy was made, in which he became a roaring success and became one of the many signature toys in Playtime Co. A feminine counterpart was created a year after Huggy's creation in 1985, known as Kissy Missy. In 1989, the Smiling Critters were launched along with a cartoon series based on them. The toy line suffered due to the CatNap toy giving children nightmares. It was later discovered that instead of the marketed scent: lavender, the CatNap toys contained a smokey red mist which was causing the nightmares. However, the controversy had already made its way to the media. To try and rectify the situation, all CatNap toys were recalled by Playtime Co.\n\n1990s\" After getting hired at Playtime Co in January of 1990, Harley Sawyer a.k.a. \"The Doctor\", approached Playtime Co.'s executives in 1990 with a solution for the company's ongoing problems. Incidents of lower-level employees witnessing confidential experiments and decreasing profits, and publicity incidents such as the CatNap Recall were causing Playtime Co. to crumble. Harley proposed the development of giant toys to increase the workforce and cut costs as a potential solution. After the Bigger Bodies Initiative was accepted, Playtime Co. built the Game Station to test their orphans, as their minds could be easily molded into subservient workers. An orphan would have a toy assigned to them and have to complete three minigames, which would test the child's brain speed and efficiency, reaction time, and physical endurance and strength. As they played the games, scientists would monitor their progress from nearby observation rooms, write down how they did, then send the assessments to Stella Greyber. If they did well, the orphan would be sent back to Playcare, where CatNap would release Red Smoke, putting them to sleep every night until they would eventually get turned into their assigned toy through a neurosurgical procedure. On November 20, 1990, the procedure of Experiment 1188 had begun on Theodore Grambell, taking them around 4 hours longer than they had hoped. Two months later, in January 1991, the Bigger Bodies CatNap, as part of the Smiling Critters, was introduced to Playcare. By February 20, 1991, a Cross-Department report details around Experiment 1188. On May 5th, 1992, Playtime Co.'s Heyday, the Game Station was packed with kids. The children would be guided by Mommy Long Legs, waiting for the pre-recorded Stella Greyber intercom to guide the kids to the next room. On June 18th, 1992, Huggy Wuggy managed to escape the factory at night, with 2 workers alerting Playtime Co. staff about the issue. Several staff members were sent to chase and sedate Huggy Wuggy with tranquilizer guns, but 1170 ended up killing 5 employees and causing 6 to go missing. Eventually, he was caught and sedated 4 hours later. After the incident concludes, Leith Pierre and the Innovation department were very unhappy about the situation and blamed the incident on staff negligence. During that night, 1170 is seen looking at the camera while standing in front of a suburban house, which is presumed to be his foster home. (This implies that the orphan soul inside Huggy was scared and wanted to return to a familiar location.). On August 8th, 1995, The Prototype set up an incident known as The Hour of Joy that made all of the Bigger Bodies Toys hostile and murder everyone within the Factory in brutal ways. During this time, Kissy Missy was being transported to the Playcare as part of the Bigger Bodies Contingency Plan. But once The Hour of Joy started, she broke free and started to attack the employees as well. During that time, The Player, then an employee, didn't show up on the day for (currently) unknown reasons. After everyone (with the exception of Leith Pierre and P.W.) was killed, the toys dragged the corpses of everyone down into the lower levels of the factory and ate them as sources of food. Following this event, Playtime Co was swiftly closed. In the following weeks, Miss Delight and her sisters were locked within the school by CatNap Miss Delight believed she heard something on the other side of the door breathing leading her to create her signature weapon that she named \"Barb\" in case anything came through. Sometime afterwards, her sisters cut her off from food, presumably due to harvesting food. As time went on, she slowly went insane and started to consider her weapon Barb as an actual person. \"Barb\" eventually taught Miss Delight that if she stops moving and stands very still, the others will assume that she is dead. She relies on this tactic to ambush the other teachers (and later on, attempts to use it on The Player). Miss Delight kills her sisters off and consumes them to wear off her hunger. Sometime later, she found the door unlocked and discovered CatNap, whom she surmised was the one who locked the door. The two entered into a form of truce afterward both relaying what they see to each other and The Prototype.After the tragic incident, Leith Pierre sent in Survivors to collect the Toy Parts in the Puzzle Pillars, while The Prototype sent monsters (1170, 1222, and Boxy Boo) to stop them and use their bodies to feed the starving Wuggies. Eventually, Playtime Co. stopped sending in Survivors, and the Bigger Bodies Initiative came to a close. Eventually, the monsters ran out of employees to eat due to no more people arriving at the facility. Now desperate and out of options, they began to consume the smaller toys to survive. Any spare toys or toy parts that the monsters left were grafted onto The Prototype, which revived them. This method kept the malnourished experiments alive for the next decade. The outcry from concerned citizens and the haunting questions surrounding the mysterious disappearance of the employees left Playtime Co. with no other choice but to make the difficult decision to permanently close its doors. However, in the following years, the company was eventually forgotten by the public, as the doors of the factory were left unattended by the authorities.\n\n2000s: In the year 2005, an unknown person sent a letter and a VHS tape which features a tampered version of the Vintage Poppy Commercial to The Player. The letter makes an astonishing claim: the employees that disappeared a decade ago were still there. After reading the letter and watching the tape, The Player finally decides to return to the abandoned factory to look for the company’s missing staff, leading to the events of Poppy Playtime."

Fifteen minutes later, exactly at 11:00 a.m., The Prototype and his allies initiated a massive rebellion against their captors. In the CCTV tape shown by Poppy, Huggy Wuggy is first seen attacking employees in the Main Lobby by biting off their heads, and presumably off-screen killing the Scientist in Final Log a bit after. Next, Mommy Long Legs is shown ripping a man in half before grabbing several people and lifting them to a great height, then killing them by dropping them at the Game Station. Another employee at Water Treatment is seen tripping over and subsequently being swarmed and devoured by a mob of Ruined Critters and Mini Huggies. The scene cuts to a hallway in the School where Miss Delight and her sisters chase a man into one of the classrooms. Then it shows Kissy Missy killing the employees that were transporting her, running after one more in the background. Boxy Boo is then shown in a hallway swallowing an employee whole, then lunging to another employee off-screen. Finally, CatNap is shown in Playcare, seemingly looking for survivors, picking up and throwing an injured employee onto the stairs of the Counselor's Office. The final part of the tape shows various locations from the first three chapters, like Make-A-Friend, the Game Station, Playcare, and the catwalk leading to the Poppy Room, all filled with bodies. Although an emergency alert notice was sent out to warn the workforce, nearly everyone within the facility, both guilty and innocent, was slaughtered by the toys in the factory. Their screams can be heard in the background of two separate tapes. The remaining survivors, including Leith Pierre and P.W. were forced to flee the factory. The toys later referred to this rebellion as \"The Hour of Joy,\" with the monsters remaining in their previous locations. After the event concluded, the corpses of all those deceased employees were dragged to the deepest parts of the facility to be consumed by the toys as a source of food to survive.\n\nAftermath: After the incident, Playtime Co. was swiftly closed, though it remains unclear if any investigation was ever launched. Leith Pierre sent in Resource Extraction Specialists to collect the Toy Parts in the Puzzle Pillars, while The Prototype sent Huggy, Mommy, and Boxy to stop them and use their bodies to feed the rest of the experiments who were beginning to starve around the factory, such as the Wuggies and Ruined Critters. Eventually, Playtime Co. stopped sending in Resource Extraction Specialists, bringing the Bigger Bodies Initiative to a close. This left the experiments without a steady source of food, which either dwindled or was cut off. The experiments, now desperate and out of options, began to turn on each other for sustenance. Any spare toys or toy parts that the monsters left behind were grafted onto The Prototype, which revived them. This method kept the experiments alive for the next decade. The outcry from the concern citizens and the haunted questions surrounding the mysterious disappearance of the employees left Playtime Co. with no other choice but to make the difficult decision to permanently close its doors. However, in the following years, the company was eventually forgotten by the public, as the doors of the factory were left unattended by the authorities until the eventual return of The Player in 2005."

          "content": "The Bigger Bodies Initiative was the driving force of Playtime Co.'s human experiments and the catalyst of the company's eventual downfall. It was proposed by Harley Sawyer to address the ongoing declining profits, failed experiments, and accidental sightings at Playtime Co., which rose after the Smiling Critters fiasco. The Bigger Bodies Initiative entailed illegal and unethical experimentation on humans, mainly orphan children. The bodies of these subjects used in tandem with poppy flowers, believed by Elliot Ludwig to process life-altering properties, would bring about organisms modeled after the toys produced by Playtime Co.\n\nHistory\n- Founding: Harley Sawyer, known simply as \"The Doctor\", approached Playtime Co.'s executives in 1990 with a solution for the company's ongoing short comings. Declining profits, failed experiments, lower-level employees bearing witness to confidential projects, and publicity incidents such as the recall of all CatNap toys were causing Playtime Co. to enter into a stage of rapid decline. Sawyer proposed the creation of organisms known as Bigger Bodies, oversized vessels modeled after the company's toys, created with the purpose of replacing the human workforce at the Playtime Co. toy factory in order to cut the company's costs and avoid future lawsuits.[1][2]\n\n- Post-Introduction: After the Bigger Bodies Initiative was accepted, Playtime Co. built the Game Station to test their orphans, as their minds could be easily molded into subservient workers. An orphan was assigned a toy and had to complete three minigames, which tested the child's brain speed and efficiency, reaction time, and physical endurance and strength. As they played the games, scientists monitored their progress from nearby observation rooms, recorded their performance, then sent the assessments to Stella Greyber. If they did well, the orphan would be sent back to Playcare, where they would stay until eventually being turned into their assigned toy. At night, CatNap would breathe out the Red Smoke which would make the children fall asleep, allowing the scientists to carry out their duties and take any children out for their toy procedure. However, these procedures sometimes had unexpected side effects: some experiments couldn’t remember who they were or what had happened to them. By March 30th, 1991,[3] via Harley's leadership, Playtime Co. had created multiple experiments to aid in different parts of the factory. Experiment 1170 served as the factory's security, Experiment 1222, served as the Game Station's host, Experiment 1188 was the caretaker of Playcare, and Experiment 1160, who was also the first successful bigger body, served as a last resort for disposing any lower-level employees aware about the initiative. Most of the experiments were made from orphans at the Playcare, whereas some experiments were made from volunteering employees. They also created a Bigger Bodies Handbook and Relocation Guide to implement into employee training. Presumably, in case the experiments ever rebelled (or to keep lower-ended employees in the dark), Playtime Co. placed Toy Parts inside the Puzzle Pillars so they could continue to build more giant toys. However, Experiment 1006: The Prototype, did not want the Bigger Bodies Initiative to continue and began to sabotage Playtime Co.'s progress, presumably after he escaped confinement. On June 18th, 1992, Huggy Wuggy escaped Playtime Co. after accessing the ventilation system, killing five of the security team employees sent to get him and causing the other six to go missing before he was finally sedated and captured, whilst standing in front of a house presumed to be his foster home. (This implies the orphan turned into Huggy was scared and wanted to return to a familiar location.) "

Multiple large cubical with technical innovations and control modules can be seen on-foot or seen throughout the walls of the factory. Each room is unique, filled with the familiar glowing lights yet each has a different format. The main highlight of this facility is the large one-eyed mechanism sitting in the middle of the factory, sitting alongside many toy production lines and a Puzzle Pillar. Zone 01 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. This zone concentrates on hand-crafting designs, with a disconnected design facility and elevated platform that can be acquired through a slide-like staircase within the room. Production tables, innovating supplies, and eatables can be seen throughout the area - primary facing towards the wall. Zone 02 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. It emerges into a light olive green color, unlike the original cyan-blue color. The room consists of a Puzzle Pillar is closed off by two Crash Doors, and features such as multiple rack sets holding toys and pipes throughout the walls and ceiling. The room across from it appears to be an employee storage, with multiple scattered lockers, shelves, and rackets. Finally this zone is connected to Zone 5 through a Grapple Handle and great pit connecting the two rooms together. Zone 03 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. This zone appears as a rectangle-shaped area with a single Puzzle Pillar within it. Small desks and connecting pipes can be seen around/inside this area, alongside a small garbage dump nearby. A Crash Door can be shut from the far left, and a Grapple Handle can be scrutinized, simply covering a minor part of the room. Zone 04 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. This zone has a singular ventilation system that looks similar to a plus sign. The ventilation system serves no real purpose other than as a diversion for Monsters chasing Specialists, and there are no other props in this room aside from hazard warnings and signs. Zone 05 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. This zone acts as if a supply closet with a single Puzzle Pillar featured. The room consists of small props hanged on shelves, alongside mechanisms and tools kept in storage for certain innovative situations. Red buckets, yellow crates, and red gas cans can be seen sitting on these shelves. Bron-themed water-tanks and pipe supports can be seen sitting in the corner of the room. Finally, the room has many exits, including many ventilation systems and a small hallway leading to Zone 02. Below the zone composed of a Employee Only, appearing as though a Kitchen. Disparate any room, the place glows an orange color as apposed to the traditional cyan lights. The room composed of a kitchen station complete of supplies and tools such as a fridge, microwave, and more. Sweet, snacks and various variants meals could be found around the station, messily placed onto the counters. Alone from the station, a blue board featuring more messily placed snacks could be scrutinized all over the all board. Zone 06 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. This zone mainly consists of a compact, small area with only one highlight, a Toy Deposit mechanism. Outside this area there are many sitting defective items in yellow garbage bags. Zone 07 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the toy factory. This zone contains a small control module-area with many long counters full of buttons and technology. A Port-A-Lounge can be found within this room, a small shelf featuring the same props seen within Zone 05 can also be found, and a toy deposit mechanism can also be found in this area. Zone 09 is one of the nine zones seen throughout the Playtime Factory. This zone depicts a power-managing area, featuring many power boxes and mechanisms that appear to be connected to the walls. The room also features a large hole blocked off by railings, with the hole featuring numerous pipes going down to nothing below. A Puzzle Pillar can be featured within this zone as well. Finally, an elevated surface that leading to a long hall connecting Zone 06 to Zone 08 together via catwalks connecting all the zones throughout the factory. The Game Station is an underground area with no natural light, which was raised as a concern in a Formal Request Form to add fake windows to ensure that the children maintained good mental health. It contains a series of playground structures for kids to play with while waiting for the next mini-game to start. In one of these playground structures, a Train Trophy can be collected. These structures are incredibly colorful, full of red, yellow, and blue colors. Most of the structures include a playground-like area with slides, circular monkey bars, and spinning wheels. In the far center of the area, a massive train can be seen under the Game Station logo."

          "content": "The second Train Station serves as a general location for the train to make a stop at to Playcare, with a set of yellow neon lights around the tunnel walls. At the station itself, there is a set of 2 tripod gates with a statue of Huggy Wuggy in the middle of it with some blood spattered on it as well. These gates lead to some stairs which head up to Elliot's Express. There are also two doors on each side of the room. one that leads to the security room, and the other to the power room. In the security room, there is a desk with 15 monitor screens above it showing static, and another door that leads to the power room. On the train tracks, there is some scattered debris that came from the ceiling, and to the left of the door leading to the Trash Compactor area, there is a burning wreck of what remains of the Train that the Player once used to try and escape the toy factory.\n\nPlaycare is an underground location in Playtime Co, accessible through Elliot's Express. When entering, it has a stairway alongside with a red carpet, little trees with red, yellow and blue flowers, red and yellow street lamps with yellow lights on them with red, blue and yellows steamers. On the stairs are some rope poles with broken toys on them, blood stains, and cardboard cutouts of Bron and Bunzo Bunny. Once entering, there is a sidewalk into a circle, and on the sidewalk are cutouts of Huggy Wuggy, Mommy Long Legs and PJ Pug-a-Pillar, and a bunch of Bron themed streetlamps. In the center of Playcare, there is a large low pillar. It is white on the bottom, leaves are overgrown around the top, a white fence is set around it with flower pots. On top are statues of the Smiling Critters holding hands, while the CatNap statue has collapsed onto the floor due to a cloud falling down on it. Around the base of the pillar are podiums with descriptions for each of the Smiling Critters and a button to hear a voice line. At the front is a map of the locations in Playcare. Inside the pillar is a backup generator that needs to be powered by the backup generators in the other locations at Playcare. At the top of dome is a gigantic artificial skylight, the inside of the vast dome is painted a blue sky with clouds and trees, and when the lights go out, stars can be seen painted on the inside of the dome. Fake clouds hang from the ceiling, and on the grass are stones, flowers, yellow tables, blue chairs and longer trees. On the left side of the cable car, there is also a door to the Gas Production Zone. Playcare has five main locations around the area: a Counselor's Office, a Toy Store, Home Sweet Home, a School, a Playhouse, and a Duck Pond. There is also a playground near the schoolhouse.\n\nThe Gas Production Zone is a location seen in Chapter 3: \"Deep Sleep\" of Poppy Playtime. It is the production area for The Red Smoke and where to control its direction. Entered via a door in the back of Playcare's dome, the Gas Production Zone is a large room where the Red Smoke is produced. In the center is a giant machine with a terminal with three tubes, which control the destination of the Red Smoke. Found in the backrooms of the zone is a sludge-like liquid known as Poppy Gel. A smaller room contains the GrabPack 2.0 and the \"GrabPack 2.0 Prototype\" tape. An elevator in the far left of the room leads to the Safe Room. A doorway to the left leads to the Hatch Room.\n\nHome Sweet Home, first mentioned in the Chapter 3 Interactable ARG, is a major location in Chapter 3: \"Deep Sleep\". It is a sub-division of Playcare where the orphans slept. It is also where CatNap used to reside in, using The Red Smoke to put the orphans to sleep. Home Sweet Home's exterior resembles a two-story wooden house, with brilliant sky-blue walls, curved roofs, and a large wooden foyer overlooking the property. The foyer holds a few patio chairs and two window box planters, each possessing three fake flowers, while three stone pillars hold up a slanted roof, which in turn supports the second-floor balcony. Above the wooden balcony door, shaded by a second but smaller slanted roof, lies a statue of the famous Poppy Playtime. The roof itself comes with a chimney and has six poppy flower designs dispersed across its brown tiles. Inside of Home Sweet Home appears to have wooden floors and walls, and its rooms are filled with bunk beds. The beds all have Playtime Co. pillows and sheets with blue mattresses. Like other locations in Playcare, Home Sweet Home's walls and floor are covered in CatNap's claw marks and inscriptions. Inside there are multiple types of sleeping arrangements, both single/double bedrooms and large communal barracks on the upper floors. In the center of these barracks is a large Bobby BearHug statue, which (when powered) will turn towards any person in its line of sight. The location also features multiple secret doors leading to staff areas of the facility, these were normally off-limits to kids. There is a large central foyer which acts as a central hub for the facility, along with laundry rooms in the basement. The walls of Home Sweet Home are decorated with many photographs of children, presumably those who were adopted out or sent off for processing as part of the Bigger Bodies Initiative. The facility has some form of security system that enters lockdown during the \"night\" restricting movement between sections.\n\nThe Schoolhouse,[1] or School, is a location seen in Chapter 3: \"Deep Sleep\" of Poppy Playtime. It was one of the five main buildings within Playcare, intended to be an educational institution dedicated to teaching the orphans basic subjects. This is also where Miss Delight and her sisters used to reside in to teach the orphans. The School’s exterior resembles a large school building. It is mainly red with two blue doors as the entrance with different colored handles, an arch above the doors, as well with windows with blue outlines on each side, and a mailbox of Boxy Boo can be seen nearby. The building’s roof is red with blue outlines, with painted flowers on top, and in the middle of the roof is stout belltower with the giant bell inside. There are giant crayons acting as pillars supporting the roof in front of the entrance and at two corners. The School’s interior appears to be abandoned inside. The building’s walls are white with flowers and grass at the bottom, and the ceilings are covered in ruined tiles with broken toys hanging out. It has long hallways with multiple doors of abandoned classrooms, and Playtime Co. lockers with eyes on them, as well as multiple posters of the Smiling Critters. Going deeper in the School, a bunch of banners of Bron, Candy Cat, and Boxy Boo can also be seen around the school.\n\nThe Caverns is a large underground cave system that takes place outside of the dome of Playcare. There is a bunch of platforms and catwalks connected to each other. Close to the entrance that leads into Playhouse, there is a big shrine that is a mix of toy body's and parts that was created by CatNap to worship his god, The Prototype.\n\nThe Playhouse is an indoor play area location seen in Chapter 3: \"Deep Sleep\". It was one of the main buildings within Playcare, where orphans could play. After The Hour of Joy, it became the home of the Ruined Critters as well as a jailhouse for heretics under CatNap's vigilance. The Playhouse’s exterior resembles a circus tent. In general, the outside of the Playhouse is painted in yellow and blue, with the main entrance door is a yellow and red door with a sign above it that tells the building name with blue and red stars coming out of the sign. On one side of the tent is a slide that used as a way to leave Playhouse. In front of the main entrance is a open treasure chest with coins that has the Playtime Co logo on them. The interior of the Playhouse resembles a playground with maze like elements, which has colorful bricks walls and tunnels. Going further in the Playhouse, there are multiple holes to where the Ruined Critters comes crawling out of, as well as jail cells. Catnaps room is also in here its refered to as his 'prison' its a room decorated likemost of this place but with a cat paw like bed with scratch marks everywhere. The Ruined Critters were originally a neutral party that joined the rebellion of the Bigger Bodies experiments on August 8, 1995, but later chose to ally with CatNap and The Prototype upon witnessing their larger counterparts' downfall. The Ruined Critters inhabited the darkness of the Playhouse. Though initially presented as mindless feral creatures, the Ruined Critters are, in reality, driven by an intense desire for self-preservation. Like the other experiments, they participated in The Hour of Joy to obtain freedom, which Playtime Co. had refused to grant them. After bearing witness to the decimation of their Bigger Bodies counterparts, who had orchestrated a futile coup against The Prototype's expanding influence, they pledged their loyalty to CatNap, obeying his orders without question. Because The Prototype's side was the dominant force of the now-abandoned factory, this alliance ensured their survival in the long run. Like CatNap, the Ruined Critters enjoyed the thrill of the hunt when confronting their prey. During The Player's trek through their home, they emitted distorted giggling and animalistic snarls as they approached the intruder. The Ruined Critters also displayed wariness when they were met with resistance, keeping their eyes locked on the aggressor as they retreated backwards into the safety of Playhouse's infrastructure.\n\nThe Counselor's Office is one of the five main attractions in Playcare, and was presumably a place for children to seek counseling if need be, and is the area CatNap mostly roams. The Counselor's Office exterior resembles a large marble building. Upon approach, there is a large stairway to the main entrance, and after the first, there two trash bins, with one of them knocked over, and The Hour of Joy sign written in blood. On the side of the the stairway, damage construction can be seen. Similar to the Train Station, two statues of Huggy Wuggy can be seen in each side. The Counselor's Office has poles attached to the roof, and the front of the rooftop features the Smiling Critters on top. The office has windows with the entrance having a brown door, as well as a mailbox that resembles Boxy Boo on the right side of the entrance. The inside of the Counselor’s Office appears to have a room with two doors, while one of them has The Red Smoke inside, as well as a slot where the Batteries can be found above the seats. The building inside mostly has long hallways with multiple doors and offices, breadboards, as well as multiple toys, papers and blood on the floor, and a couple of the offices are overlooking the locations in Playcare."

          "content": "Description: The Smiling Critters are small, colorful, anthropomorphic animals, each appearing as a plush toy with a zipper on the front chest, large gaping smiles, and black eyes with white pupils. Each toy has a unique pendant representing the core aspect of each of their personalities. In addition to this, each Smiling Critter comes with the ability to emit their own unique scent via a hole in their mouths by pulling on their tails, all of which are traditionally used to aid with sleep or relaxation, being based on a specific type of fruit, herb, or flower.\n\nHistory: In the summer of 1989, the Smiling Critters were created by Playtime Co., and to promote the launch of the toys, a cartoon of the same name would air on Saturdays.[1] However during its air, parents were concerned about how silent and distant CatNap was from the rest of the cast, as well as finding him putting everyone to sleep disturbing.[1] During the production of the plushies, a mistake caused some CatNap plushies to emit The Red Smoke instead of the preferred lavender, making kids in the US who owned the toy suffer violent nightmares. Because of the controversy, the cartoon's reception would run afoul and turn sour[1], and as a result, CatNap was recalled from the lineup and removed from all promotional material. Following the negative reception of the cartoon, it was pulled off air and put into Playtime's vault, never to be repeated. At some point, the Smiling Critters became the main mascots of Playcare. After late 1990, the characters would be used in the Bigger Bodies Initiative,[2] with an orphan, Theodore Grambell, becoming CatNap, designated Experiment 1188, and would be housed in Home Sweet Home. On August 8th, 1995, CatNap and their plush toys participated in The Hour of Joy, killing everyone within Playcare no matter if they were innocent or guilty, and feasting on their bodies, leaving only the children alive.[3] However, the rest of the cast allegedly fought back against The Prototype's control but were eventually killed off by either him or CatNap, with DogDay being the only survivor and kept tortured within the Playhouse's prison cells. It is unclear as to whether the other Smiling Critters characters were recreated for the Bigger Bodies Initiative besides CatNap, Bobby BearHug, and DogDay, since their names are never directly mentioned in relation to the project. The Smiling Critters appear as the secondary antagonists of Chapter 3: \"Deep Sleep\" as worn down miniature versions of themselves, referred to as Ruined Critters. Only DogDay and CatNap's Bigger Bodies counterparts are fully seen in the chapter, though both eventually perish. The Smiling Critters cast also make appearances in the forms of Playtime posters, cardboard cutouts, and statues in the center of Playcare's dome, the latter two of where audio files of them can be played. Bobby BearHug also appears as two security statues in Home Sweet Home, from which The Player must obtain Batteries. Hoppy Hopscotch does not make many direct appearances, but motifs of her enthusiastic plus cooperative personality and lightning bolt pendant both occur repeatedly within the chapter. The other Smiling Critters characters do not appear to have any special occurrences."

            "The Prototype"
          ],
          "content": "Appearance: The Prototype's physical appearance is yet to be revealed, though CatNap's shrine seems to give an idea to his overall appearance. His only known body part is his left arm, resembling slender silver pins that appear adept at a large array of movements. Although his fingers appear fragile, they can effortlessly puncture through flesh with unnerving smoothness. His upper arm is adorned with red wires and metallic components, while the forearm contains a human radius and ulna. It can be assumed 1006 was roughly the same shape and morphology as the person used to make him, as it was not until Experiment 1160 that experiments were no longer bound to those rules regarding their shapes and sizes.\n\nPersonality: The Prototype exhibits a personality solely built upon his hatred and wishes for the downfall of Playtime Co. He is cunning, stubborn, and rarely displays sarcasm. In a conversation with Harley Sawyer during Log 24459, the Prototype's voice is heard for the first time, as he mockingly replays the voices of various employees like Stella Greyber. He engages in a monologue about his motivations, questioning Harley Sawyer's thoughts on the effects of the Bigger Bodies Initiative and the treatment of experiments. After Sawyer comments on learning something new about the Prototype at each meeting, he sarcastically thanks Harley and repeats his words back at him. The Prototype is manipulative, telling Theodore Grambell how to get a GrabPack despite knowing his young age and inexperience. He also seems careless, using the experiments as pawns for his reign of terror, particularly evident in the RESTRICTED tapes. These tapes depict toys being taken over by the Prototype, aiming to sabotage their attempts at progress and transportation of their experiments. The most notable example is Huggy Wuggy, whom the Prototype ordered to flee the Playtime Co. factory. As soon as Huggy Wuggy ran too far out, he began simply roaming the woods and only attacked employees after being aggravated. There is only one instance where he seemed to care for another being. After Theodore was electrocuted, the Prototype gave up his chance at freedom to save the boy, bringing him to a scientist for medical aid. This may likely be another case of manipulation, since Theodore, as CatNap, would feel indebted to the Prototype and follow him around whenever he was present, despite the Prototype largely ignoring him.\n\nBackstory\nLittle is known about the Prototype other than the fact that he was the ideal vessel or result Playtime Co were looking for. He had been created sometime before or during 1989 prior to the Bigger Bodies Initiative. So he was presumably a prototype for an unnamed scientific field referenced in the Chapter 4 Icepick ARG. Experiment 1006 was the first experiment to be sentient after the company's attempts at replicating Elliot Ludwig's attempts at post-mortem vessels to possess. The Prototype was also stated to be an outlier with their other experiments, as he did not require any substance or food for survival. These findings were one of many that employees, primarily Harley Sawyer, enjoyed perceiving. It was stated that the Prototype showed a new trait of himself during every session, being an interesting figure to examine. Scientists said he was very clever and intelligent.\n\nScientific Logs\nLogVideo\nThe Prototype as seen during the Final Log.\n\nDuring one session, specifically during Log 24459, the Prototype converses with Harley Sawyer, questioning if any employees felt remorse for the experiments, asking why they \"stick...beat...[and] tear at [their] flesh.\" Harley Sawyer cleverly retorted, challenging the Prototype and pointing out how he continuously uncovers new aspects about him in each session. The Prototype thanked Harley before mocking him once more, remarking how he too learns something from Harley every day in Harley's own voice.\n\nIn another session, during Log 08502, the familiar Scientist recounts an incident relating to the Prototype. It is stated that 1006 was primarily kept in his chamber, monitored at all times. However, one day, he created a laser pointer from the digital alarm clock in his room, fired it at the camera and disabled it for 28.3 seconds. Upon which he hid in a blind spot, forcing a surveillance specialist to come in. He tried to escape through the door but was re-locked before he could. He apparently killed the specialist who was trapped inside, as 'one casualty occurred.'\n\nTheodore Grambell\nIn 1989[2], the Prototype escaped confinement and hid inside Playcare, recruiting a troubled orphan named Theodore Grambell to his cause. He frequently encouraged the young boy to sabotage Playtime Co., but to no avail. Their friendship became notorious amongst the staff, who at first believed that the boy's \"friend\" was imaginary.\n\nOne day, Theodore received instructions from 1006 to open a maintenance door in Playcare using two stolen GrabPack 2.0s and a Green GrabPack Hand, with the intention of either allowing the orphans to escape or allowing himself to escape. But due to his young age and lack of expertise, Theodore overcharged the Green GrabPack Hand[3], electrocuting himself and requiring immediate medical attention. Though they opened the door, the Prototype chose to sacrifice his freedom to save Theodore. He brought the wounded boy to Thomas Clarke's office, the latter spotting him, before he was recaptured by Security.\n\nTwo years later, 1006 reunited with Theodore Grambell, who had now become CatNap. During their time together, CatNap followed the Prototype around \"like a lost puppy,\" as stated by Leith Pierre, with 1006 seemingly ignoring him.\n\nRESTRICTED-disappearance\nOn June 18th, 1992, Huggy Wuggy was influenced by the Prototype and instructed to leave the Playtime Co. factory. Without any warning, Huggy Wuggy hastily exited the facility through an open bay delivery door. Huggy Wuggy oddly did not display any hostile behavior during his escape, merely running out of the building before being captured on surveillance footage wandering in the forest. Upon encountering employees who started firing darts at him, Huggy Wuggy, although not under the Prototype's direct control, perceived their presence as a threat and attacked them. This led to the death of nearly 11 employees, with 6 others reported missing.\n\nThe Hour of Joy\n“\tExperiment 1-0-0-6. The Prototype. Coordination and cooperation is evidently within his skillset, as well as the skillset of all other experiments of his type. Though still missing, today's events are no doubt in relation to him. His absence was a flaw in the scientific process, which should have under no circumstances been left unaccounted for.\t”\n— The Scientist's description of the Prototype.\n\n\nHourofJoyHuggyScene\nThe beginning of The Hour of Joy, starting with Huggy Wuggy in the Main Lobby.\n\nIn an unspecified time during the 1990s, the Prototype was declared missing. In one VHS Tape, Marcas Brickley Reprimanding, it was stated that a figure with \"fifty feet and a thousand legs\" stole a mop handle which, while it may imply that this figure was PJ Pug-a-Pillar, the motivations to steal such item is unclear, leading to the idea that it was the Prototype.\n\nDuring this time of freedom, 1006 took over the Playtime Co. factory on August 8th, 1995. This event, known as \"The Hour of Joy,\" involved a large-scale massacre and jailbreak against all humans present in the factory. While the employees were focused on transporting Kissy Missy to Playcare, the Bigger Bodies experiments began a rebellion as they mindlessly slaughtered all adults and scientists all while under the influence of the Prototype. After the event concluded, the bodies were dragged into the depths of the factory and the toys ultimately fed on them to survive. The sudden disappearance of all of the employees led to the closure of Playtime Co. However, as the human supply diminished, the toys started betraying one another in an effort to secure the remaining food resource. Any spare toys or toy parts that the monsters left behind were grafted onto the Prototype. This continued for a decade until the eventual return of The Player in 2005.\n\nChapter 1: \"A Tight Squeeze\"\nAfter Huggy Wuggy was killed by falling down into the depths of the factory into the Water Treatment at the end of the chapter, the Prototype presumably took him away, and grafted him onto his body offscreen. The Prototype isn't seen in the entire chapter, however he is mentioned by his experiment number in the Final Log.\n\nChapter 2: \"Fly in a Web\"\nAfter Mommy Long Legs was killed by the grinder and her severed torso fell to the ground, the Prototype's claw appeared from under the half-closed door to the left. He reached out and took Mommy's torso away, dragging it away back under the door. After this, he presumably grafts Mommy onto his body and isn’t seen again for the rest of the chapter.\n\nWhen Ollie talks to The Player about Playcare, he says that the new antagonist, CatNap, has overtaken Playcare and dedicated it as a \"church\" to the Prototype. Poppy explains later that it was the Prototype that was responsible for the needless slaughter of so many people, saying that she intentionally stopped The Player from leaving in the first place since she needed them to destroy him. When sneaking through the Caverns, The Player spots CatNap worshipping a shrine built seemingly after the likeness of the Prototype. In the Playhouse, DogDay further elaborates on CatNap's reverence of the Prototype.\n\nCatNap sees the Prototype as his god and that any who oppose it are labelled as heretics, with DogDay and the rest of the Smiling Critters being among them. Many toys would be killed, forcing the rest of them into submission to the Prototype, and DogDay is cruelly tortured for his rejection of the Prototype's control. Exiting the Playhouse, Ollie corresponds DogDay's story, saying that before CatNap was CatNap, the Prototype saved his life. This led to CatNap seeing the Prototype as the saviour for all the toys in Playtime Co.\n\nAs The Player sneaks through the Counselor's Office, CatNap attacks them and sends them into another dream. Just before the dream ends, the Prototype's hand reaches through the open roof of the Main Lobby."

          "content": "Appearance: Sawyer appears as a brain in a machine. Or an eye on computer monitors throughout the foundation.\n\nPersonality: Harley Sawyer was a cruel, merciless, narcissistic, sociopathic and apathetic scientist who cared little about anyone or anything other than himself and his goals. With his Bigger Bodies Initiatives, he sealed the fate of in-numerous amounts of orphans and other unfortunate employees into living toys and pioneered an era of what could essentially be said as mass murder and terror. Few of his personality traits listed below can be considered positive, and it is heavily implied that even as a young child, he was already very troubled, carrying his distinctive trait of pure and utter focus on himself and little of others.\n\nWhile his \"normal\" personality appeared to be one of staidness combined with a gentle voice and general politeness, this personality broken (which can be done easily as shown numerous times) reveals that he was actually an angry, violent, and irritable person who can hardly tolerate anyone, even his co-workers, even finding it disgusting when he saw some employees show sympathy for the living toys. In the tape Your gift has finally arrived., Sawyer found out someone was recording him and ferociously yelled that the camera be turned off immediately, immediately contrasting with his gentle voice. With this attitude in mind, he is widely disliked by almost everyone; his colleagues when he worked as a neurosurgeon thought of him as a joke as he constantly worried that the world was not too far off from ending and was a major perfectionist, while in Playtime Co., none of the heads (Eddie, Leith, and Stella) could tolerate his behaviour for long and various Specialists wished he could be killed off by Boxy Boo.\n\nSawyer also appears to be notoriously picky; in the Sandwich Note, the writer tells their friend that Sawyer resented sweet pickles, warning them that if they take his order, they must not pick out sweet pickles lest they get punished severely. Even if this is a joke from the writer, it provides a good insight of his personality and implies he is very childish despite his age.\n\nIn the Experiment 1188 Bigger Bodies Proposal, the person writing the proposal states that \"Dr. Sawyer insists he handle the extraction himself.\", indicating that Sawyer was very much dedicated to the Bigger Bodies Initiative and/or wanted to be credited for the extraction, either as an honor for his dedication to research or an arrogant way to gain recognition.\n\nIn the Prisoner Profile for Yarnaby, Sawyer notes that it should be kept isolated, having only contact with him, saying: \"By the time I'm done...I'll be its whole world. It'll know nothing else.\" This shows Sawyer to be manipulative and apathetic to the plight of his experiments, simply not caring for them in the least. It also shows him to be very merciless and cruel, as what Sawyer implies is him having total control on Yarnaby, which no doubt would involve torture in various ways. After Yarnaby’s death, Sawyer shows no feeling for his pet, merely stating that he was not the only one of his pets, further supporting this.\n\nIn the Chapter 4 Gameplay Trailer: Doey the Doughman, Sawyer states that he wishes to make a game out of the Player and, before the Player is dropped down an unknown shaft, he sarcastically waves at them, showing that he can be extremely sadistic and that he likes to toy with people who are at his mercy\n\nHistory\nBackstory\nIn his youth, Harley Sawyer joined and participated in the Young Geniuses Program, as indicated by Leith Pierre, which is presumably where Sawyer got his start in Playtime Co. However, Ludwig became concerned at his lack of humility and willingness to experiment simply for the sake of progress rather than for the \"benefit of humanity\". He tried to instill that humility in Sawyer, which only served to anger him. Seeing no other choice in the face of this, Elliot Ludwig regretfully ejected him from the Young Geniuses Program. Sawyer saw this as a betrayal, coming to see Elliot Ludwig as \"soft\", \"small-minded\" and a \"backstabber\".[3]\n\nLater on January 15th, 1990, Harley Sawyer was hired by Leith Pierre to work as a neurosurgeon at Playtime Co. and eventually became the Head of Special Projects, a secret division within the company. During his employment, he learned about the company's failed experiments and realized they would go bankrupt if they got sued, which seemed to be an eventuality. Determined to prevent this, Sawyer strove to find a solution for the toy company.\n\nCan you hear us? Can you see this?\nHarley Sawyer approached the Playtime Co. executives with a solution for the company's ongoing problems. Incidents of lower-level employees witnessing confidential experiments and decreased profits were causing Playtime Co. to crumble. Sawyer proposed the development of large toys to increase the workforce and cut costs as a potential solution. He called this solution the Bigger Bodies Initiative and requested that he oversee and lead the project.\n\nArchive 5b00 Transcript\nSawyer takes an interest in Quinn Navidson, upon noticing that Quinn appears to be holding back during tests. He personally promises to oversee Quinn's next test after telling him that he knew Quinn could achieve a good result.\n\nPrisoner Profile\nFollowing Quinn's transformation into Experiment 1166, Sawyer notes that 1166 lacks higher cognitive function, but he also observes that 1166 also displays an 'odd loyalty' to the security staff, something he finds \"nauseating\", comparing it to the manner in which domesticated cats behave. Realising this means that 1166 could be \"bent\", Sawyer orders 1166 to be isolated, coming into contact with only Sawyer himself. He expresses that he needs \"protection\" because of his importance to the Bigger Bodies Initiative, and that he might \"get a good laugh\" at the \"pathetic\" noises 1166 makes.\n\nAdvertisement\nCross-Department Report\nIn the Cross-Department Report released on February 20, 1991, Harley Sawyer on behalf of Research talks about the difficulties of CatNap's procedure, and how he is extremely pleased about CatNap's behavior, even considering him to rival Experiment 1170.\n\nYour gift has finally arrived.\nSometime after March 30, 1991, Harley Sawyer visited Boxy Boo's containment cell. The angry hunter roared as the doctor revelled in his success, proclaiming the creature to be \"the first of many\" and its very existence opening many possibilities- some presumably leading to immortality. Sawyer then decided the creature's appetite must be attuned to human flesh. He asked a nearby doctor for an update on Rowan Stoll. When a phone started ringing, Sawyer noticed that someone was recording him, and yelled for them to turn off their camera.\n\nLog 24459\nIn a log documenting the Prototype, Sawyer mentions that although the experiment was still stubborn and silent, he was able to make new discoveries about the Prototype. Before he could mention what he discovered, the Prototype makes an unintelligible noise that gets the attention of Sawyer. He ends the log but the conversation is still heard, with the Prototype asking a question while changing his voice. The Prototype asks Sawyer if he feels anything, although Sawyer does not understand the question. The Prototype clarifies by saying he harms the toys, asking if he feels it. Sawyer merely says there's a secret inside the Prototype that is \"valuable beyond all measure\". He states he harms him and makes more progress every session. He dares the Prototype to \"speak, or don't. Fight, or give in\", as regardless for Sawyer, he always learns new things of the Prototype, which he laughs about and says excites him. The Prototype thanks him, which Sawyer is surprised about. The Prototype then replays Sawyer's voice and cunningly restates his sentence about learning new things.\n\nIncident Aftermath\nFollowing the theatre incident, which resulted in the death of an unknown number of people Gerad Lockehart investigated its cause and informed Leith Pierre, Stella Greyber and Eddie M.N. Ritterman that Sawyer was responsible.\n\n“The Doctor” VHS Tape\nFollowing the revelation that Sawyer was responsible for the theatre incident, which was the most recent in a long-running line of incidents for which he was responsible, Leith Pierre, Stella Greyber and Eddie M.N. Ritterman discuss what to do with him. Eddie suggests killing Sawyer, an idea that Leith shot down because they still needed Sawyer's mind. Despite not being able to deal with Sawyer in a more permanent manner, Leith says that he has an idea on how to deal with him.\n\n“Experiment 1354” VHS Tape\nSawyer was subjected to his own procedures and turned into an experiment himself, with Dr. Bruno White performing the procedure. Sawyer awakens in a state of disorientation, before realising what has happened, referring to the higher-ups as \"backstabbing traitors\". Sawyer remarks how he feels like something has gone wrong, that Dr. White must have done something wrong. When Dr. White tries to calm Sawyer, Sawyer demands to know who gave the order. Leith Pierre confirms he gave the order, and Sawyer tells him that he has no idea what kind of mistake he had just made. Leith retorts, berating Sawyer for having so many chances to fix his mistakes but being unable to. Sawyer scoffs at the idea that Leith could do better than him, replying angrily that they needed his intellect, to which Leith tells him that's why he was converted into an experiment rather than being fed to Boxy Boo. Leith tells Sawyer what will happen from then on: he is to give the other scientists answers when they need them, and to perform procedures as directed. Sawyer furiously tells Leith that he will die for what he has done, that when he gets his hands on Leith, he's a dead man.\n\nCatNap Check-In\nIn a recording made in 1994, Leith Pierre mentions Sawyer and says he would normally be there to check up on CatNap but that he's \"out\" and needs to do his work until they find a replacement for Sawyer. This is due to Harley Sawyer having been turned into an experiment himself.\n\nExperiment 1166 Weekly Check-Up\nIn a report made in October 1994, Dr. Carmine McKabe notes that 1166 had formed an attachment to Sawyer despite Sawyer's apathy towards him, and that with Sawyer's removal from his presence, 1166 has lost his motivation.\n\n“Time” VHS Tape\nSometime after the Hour of Joy, Harley Sawyer is heard meeting with the Prototype, who deliberately spared him during the event. 1006 tells the Doctor that his suggestions have so far failed, and questions whether or not it was a good idea to spare him. Sawyer replies that more time is needed, but the Prototype angrily states that they do not have any time. Sawyer suggests he finds some more or give him lab access, yet the Prototype denies his request, telling him to “stay put”. Sawyer says that what he is trying to accomplish cannot be done quickly, leading the Prototype to ask him what his use is in that case. Sawyer replies that he is the Prototype’s “best shot”, which satisfies 1006. He tells the Doctor that he will try again, but warns him that if he is “stalling... or worse”, he should remember that his usefulness is the only reason he wasn’t “stripped for meat and spare parts”."

The limitations of such use are the skill, knowledge and imagination of the user.\n\nEnergy Blasts: The ring can be used to fire blasts of blue energy or create weapons such as projectiles of them. The ring can project beams of force powered by the will of the user. The weapon's power is more an indication of the hope of the user.\nForce-Field Generation: The ring can create various force fields of various sizes and shapes to protect the wearer and others around them. With the cosmic scope of a Blue Lantern's abilities, it is only natural that the power ring is designed for operation in space. The ring creates a force-field around the wearer, protecting them from the hazards of the void including filtration of stellar radiation and microscopic particulate matter which would ordinarily be fatal should the space debris strike the ring wielder at high speeds. An atmosphere appropriate to the ring wielder's biology is created inside the force-field, body temperature is maintained and waste products are removed. Gravitational stresses which could cause injury are stabilized for the ring wielder. Theoretically, a ring wielder could use the ring as their sole source of life support.\n\nEnergy Constructs: The ring can form constructs of blue energy. Unlike a Green Lantern Power Ring, the primary function of the Blue Power Ring will manifest its constructs in response to the target's specific psychosis, with a soothing effect based on that target's hopes. In this way, the ring can remove the corruptible influence of the red flame of rage by infusing hope. Otherwise, the ring is a weapon capable of transforming the wearer's thoughts into physical constructs through the wearer's mastery of hope. A Blue Lantern can create any particular item or construct that they can imagine as long as they have the mastery of hope necessary to will it into existence. The constructs are made out of blue energy, which is a tangible form of pure hope, and they exist only as long as a Blue Lantern is fueling it with their hopefulness. Items created by the rings are not indestructible and are only as powerful as the inspired hope of the Blue Lantern creating them. The types of constructs usually reflect the ring wearer's personality.\n\nHope Empowerment: The Blue Lantern ring is unique in that its base of power, Hope, can be drawn from for strength by the ring user. Being in direct range of the emotional aura of a Blue Lantern allows them to charge an outer power reserve; by the sheer hope of the Lantern, its power will remain constant.[3] The empowerment extends to even the stellar reactions of stars, allowing one to reverse the age of a dying star to that of a relatively newborn star. Solely empowered by the hope of the population that relied on it, in turn empowering the Blue Lantern who then collects and uses it for the purpose of transformation. The ability bypasses the need for ring energy expenditure. [4]\nRing Enhancement: The primary function of any Blue Lantern Ring is the capacity to re-energize and supercharge the powers of a Green Lantern ring, for just as a green ring enables a blue ring to use its fullest functions a blue ring can augment the powers of a green one. Prolonged charging of which has the dangerous effect of overloading said ring, however, causing it to implode taking off the light wielders hand in the process.[4] A well-kept secret among the Blue Lantern Corps is that the light of hope can empower the rings/energies of another emotional spectrum besides will, the wielder of a blue ring must willingly enable this capacity first.\n\nFear Depletion: As fear is the belief of imminent demise, hope is the belief of imminent success. As such, Blue Lantern Rings are capable of depleting the energy of Qwardian Power Rings.\n\nAvarice Immunity: A blue ring is not vulnerable to the Orange Lantern Corps' favored tactic of draining energy from other Corps' rings. The reason of this is that while Avarice erodes Will, it can't consume Hope, thus rendering Avarice useless against Hope.\nRage Removal: If a subject has been infected with the red light of rage, a Blue Power Ring can create a vision of the subject's greatest hope to calm and heal them. In the case of John Stewart, it showed him a vision of being reunited with his dead wife Katma Tui.[4] The process of the removal is part spiritual and part medical: the infected goes through a cellular cleansing, with the Blue energy serving as an antitoxin to purge red plasma from the body. With a spiritual connection active, the subject's mind is alleviated and blood production is restarted. The end result is the subject being safely released from their ring.\nFlight: By the manipulation of anti-gravitons and directed molecular movement, the ring allows the user to fly at incredible speeds.\n\nWormholes & Spacial Warps: The power ring grants its wearer access to wormholes in space, enabling the ring wielder to rapidly cut time and distance needed for transport. Black holes can be navigated by experienced ring wielders.\nTotal Cellular Regeneration: Another unique ability this ring has, is the capability to heal the worst of physical injuries. Via the Light of Hope, Blue Lanterns can use the ring to repair bodily damages within themselves or others even mending severe wounds either recent or settled in such as regenerating Ganthet's lost hand or Arkillo's missing tongue.\nElectromagnetic Scanning: The ring has a wide range of detection abilities based on the imagination of the user. If one can conceive of it, they can detect it. Magical effects like clairvoyance, seem to be the most difficult for the ring. All electromagnetic phenomena are within the range of the ring, including radio, television, infrared, ultraviolet, and high-frequency band communications.\n\nGalactic Encyclopedia: The earlier rings worn by the Corps functioned as references for their users. Having the vast knowledge of the known universe to draw upon, each ring functioned as a ready reference on most peoples, stellar events and conditions that may have been seen by other rings or other Blue Lanterns. The rings also served as a repository of adventures had by the Blue Lantern and these mission reports were stored in the Prime Battery for review and training.\n\nUniversal Translator: Keeping in mind the myriad of worlds, life forms, and cultures throughout the cosmos, it is understandable why Guardians of Hope added a translation system to the power ring.\nMaterial Alteration: The Blue Lantern's uniform is not made out of fabric. It is created by the Power Ring whenever the wearer wills to wear it. It automatically appears over the wearer's normal clothing, and vanishes when the wearer wills to return to their civilian attire. Most Blue Lantern wear similar uniforms that are programmed into the ring by default. However, each Blue Lantern is able to adjust their uniform to fit their own needs, personalities, and whims.\n\nPrecognition: Upon receiving the ring, Blue Lanterns will experience a moment of the future by the Blue Light, directly related to the wielder and with the express purpose of lifting their hopes.\n\nweakness\nEnergy Interference: As the continuing power of the ring's connection of \"universal hope\", it has a tendency to cause a form of interference to other power sources.\n\nWillpower Symbiosis: Hope is the most powerful emotion in the emotional spectrum, but it cannot reach its full potential without the willpower to enact it. In order for the blue power ring to function, it needs the aura of green willpower, supplied by a Green Lantern Ring to be in proximity to it; otherwise, the ring will only allow limited flight, limited energy projection and constructs, and protection from the vacuum of space. Starman's sonic crystal seemed to provide a similar effect"

This ability has been shown to allow the wielder to copy the power of other lantern energies. This allowed the Indigo Tribe to channel the black light of death to allow Hal Jordan to come back to life during the Blackest Night Event.\nEnergy Projection: Indigo Lantern Rings can fire energy blasts.\nFlight: By the manipulation of anti-gravitons and directed molecular movement, they can fly at incredible speeds. Within a planetary atmosphere, an Indigo Tribe member has been known to fly as fast as Mach 10 by creating an aerodynamic envelope around his/her body. Air friction is not a hindrance since heat is either absorbed or reflected by the ring's field. Towing others, usually within a bubble, his/her speed is limited to the twice the speed of sound or 1,440 mph. In space, an Indigo Tribe member's speed can be significantly greater and has been known to exceed lightspeed.\n\nMaterial Alteration: Characters recruited to the Corps have their clothing transformed into an Indigo Tribe uniform.\n\nWormholes & Spatial Warps: The Indigo Lantern Ring grants its wearer access to wormholes in space, enabling them to rapidly cut time and distance needed for transport.\nTeleportation: Indigo ring wielders are able to teleport across interstellar distances either individually or collectively.\n\nInability to be traced: As the most elusive light in the emotional spectrum, the Indigo Lanterns cannot be easily traced by any means. Scar comments on her difficulty in finding the Indigo Tribe during the opening phases of Blackest Night and Saint Walker assures Hal Jordan that the Justice League will be incapable of tracking down the whereabouts of the New Guardians since Indigo-1 teleported them away from Earth.\nOnboard Computer: Like other Power Rings, an Indigo Lantern Ring contains a basic AI that can communicate with other rings, scan the surrounding area, and interact verbally with the user.\n\nLimited Cellular Regeneration: They have a limited ability to to heal others during or after they feel great compassion. The compassion has to be genuine and the healing is only to the extent of the grief and minor aesthetics. Major injuries have not been seen to be healed by any Indigo Lantern yet. It is unknown if the Indigo Tribe can heal itself or if they must feel compassion to do so.\nDiscern Motivation: In effect with healing and restoring damaged or destroyed bodily tissue, the ring has the effect of laying bare any and every horrific thing the individual they're restoring has done in their life.\nInability to be translated: The power ring can translate virtually any language in the universe, facilitating diplomatic encounters rather than violent confrontations. However, the Indigos speak in a language not recognized by other lantern rings, making them an enigma.\nExorcism: The Green Lantern twins Jenny and Jason Allen had used the spectrum light of compassion in order to dispel and contain a powerful dark malignancy that filled others with hate and bile, compelling them to fight, murder, and commit all kinds of atrocities.\nEnergy Constructs: Although Indigo Lanterns do not usually use constructs, John Stewart managed to produce some when he wore the ring. He found them significantly inferior to the constructs of other rings"

United with us, his potential would know no limit, every hesitation obliterated by the sheer force of his will.\n\nWhen in the vicinity of a Blue Lantern, or someone wielding a Blue Lantern Ring, any Green Lantern Ring can be charged to 100% and beyond. An overcharged ring allows its user to travel faster, create larger and stronger constructs, and exert incredible amounts of energy. There is no known limit to which a ring can be overcharged to, but the highest seen is 325%.[\n\nOath\nAll power rings need periodic recharging. The process is not instantaneous so many Green Lanterns recite an oath while the ring charges. The oath is not required to charge the ring, but is recited to reaffirm the person's commitment to the Green Lantern Corps, and to measure the time it takes the ring to charge. While many Green Lanterns create their own oath, the majority use the Corps' official oath as a sign of respect. In the interests of political correctness on the part of DC (or, in context, Hal Jordan), the word \"blackest\" was replaced by \"darkest\"; this practice has been abandoned with the reinstating of the Green Lantern Corps due in part to the significance of the Blackest Night comic event. Particularily alien Green Lanterns may have modified oaths. For example, Rot Lop Fan, a Green Lantern from a starless sector, replaces light with sound in his oath.\nPowers\nBright Green Energy Conduit: The rings use pure energy supplied by a Power Battery, which in most cases takes the form of bright green light. This energy is the green light of willpower of the Emotional Electromagnetic Spectrum. Rot Lop Fan, from a race without eyes, perceives it as the sound \"F-Sharp\" and his 'ring' is actually a bell. A Green Lantern's ring, considered by some to be one of the most powerful weapons in the known universe, has the ability to affect and use fundamental forces of the known universe, including electromagnetic energies such as gravity, radiation, heat, light, and powerful blasts of concussive force. It is also theorized that the ring also has a basis in other dimensional energies commonly called magic by users of such energies. The ring can also create fields of force formed from an unknown energy that is bound by the users' will. The limitations of such use are the skill, knowledge and imagination of the user. Some of the abilities that a Green Lantern Ring has shown are:\n\nEnergy Projection: The ring can be used to fire blasts of Oan energy or create weapons such as projectiles of them. The ring can project beams of force powered by the will of the user. The ring can be used to produce kryptonite and kryptonite radiation.[5][6][7][8][9] Kyle generally used fanciful constructs in the shape of advanced technology. Their appearance does not indicate the power of the weapon. The weapon's power is more an indication of the will of the user. Certain users (i.e. Hal Jordan) have been powerful enough to stagger even Superman. If the user wishes, they can alter the form of the blasts such as Kilowog's \"booms.\" Code 1012 is a protocol to incinerate all extraterrestrial weapons and technology in the area.[10]\nForce Field: The ring can create various force fields of various sizes and shapes to protect the wearer and others around him. With the cosmic scope of a Green Lantern's duties, it is only natural that the power ring is designed for operation in space. The ring creates a force field around the wearer, protecting them from the hazards of the void including filtration of stellar radiation and microscopic particulate matter which would ordinarily be fatal should the space debris strike the ring wielder at high speeds. An atmosphere appropriate to the ring wielder's biology is created inside the force-field while body temperature is maintained and waste products are removed. Gravitational stresses which could cause injury are stabilized for the ring wielder. Theoretically, a ring wielder could use the ring as their sole source of life support. The force field seems to be created instantaneously whether this is due to programming or an instinctive reaction from intensive training has not been established. It could be considered as a subroutine of the ring's automatic defensive system, but as of yet this theory has not been proven. The only exception to that was attacks based on the color yellow. The newer version of the ring is not limited by the color yellow.\nEnergy Construct Creation: The ring can form constructs of Oan energy. The primary function of the Power Ring is to provide a weapon capable of transforming the wearer's thoughts into physical constructs through the wearer's strength of willpower. A Green Lantern can create any particular items or construct that they can imagine as long as they have the willpower necessary to will it into existence. The constructs are made out of bright green energy, which is a tangible form of pure willpower, and they exist only as long as a Green Lantern is fueling it with their willpower. Items created by the rings are not indestructible and are only as powerful as the willpower of the Green Lantern creating them. The types of constructs usually reflects the ring wearer's personality. For example, Kyle Rayner was an artist, so his constructs reflect his strong imagination. John Stewart is an architect so his constructs often appear mechanical as if he designed them in his mind before making them a reality.\nSuperhuman Strength: While not super strength of the conventional sense, a Lantern while using constructs created by the ring becomes capable of lifting/moving tremendous weights far heavier than 100 tons with little effort.\nPhasing: The Power Ring allows the wearer to pass through certain solid objects such as walls.[11] Which objects that are not penetrable are not known, but it may depend upon the strength of the wearer's willpower and the density of the object's molecular structure.\nEnvironmental Playback: Upon request, the power ring can recreate a holographic environment based on data in its memory banks. The ring wielder can observe events in a ghostlike state, but the ring wielder cannot alter the outcome of the playback. All objects in the playback will appear in the full spectrum of colors, regardless of the wielder's level of expertise creating simulacra. The power ring will automatically end the playback if outside interference warrants the ring wielder's undivided attention.\nWill Empowerment: Emerald power rings can be further magnified by the amount of will a user possesses. A wielder can not only ascertain incredible strength if their will is strong enough, but the strongest of wills also acts as a surrogate means of recharging; and in some cases, supercharging their power ring in case they are low on energy at the time. The only drawback being if their will is too strong, the ring may explode, taking the wearer with it.\nInvisibility and Light Refraction: A ring wielder can render him/her/itself invisible by willing the ring to bend light waves around them, as well as that of the power ring. Presumably, a similar action allows an experienced ring wielder to create objects of colors other than green. As Hal Jordan's experience grew, he was able to create power ring illusions of people and objects. It can be assumed the ring wielder would not risk the extra time and effort to create other colors in a combat situation. An invisibility shield was used by Hal Jordan to hide his power ring, which would only become visible when he changed to Green Lantern.\nEmerald Sight: An as of yet unexplained power in which the Green Lantern can obtain, is the ability to divine the future in glimpses of bright radiance. So far Mr. Baz is the only lantern with the power to date.[12]\nEnergy Twin: The power ring allows the wearer to create an \"energy twin\" of theirself that can travel at far greater speeds than that of the ring wielder's physical form.[13] While the energy twin is active the ring wielder remains motionless, their life force is needed to guide the energy twin. The energy twin can not alter its surroundings and may only be perceived by the Guardians or another ring wielder as a green, ghostlike image. Any knowledge gained by the energy twin is transferred back to the ring wielder's physical form upon recontact with the body. The Guardians frequently used energy twins as a means of contacting a Green Lantern. As a rule, a ring wielder can not create actual, independent duplicates of themself, as the power ring cannot create life.\nEnergy Absorption: The ring can absorb and store other energies. Doing so does NOT replenish the normal store of energy the ring has. A ring that needs recharging but contained a store of electricity could only discharge that electricity, for example.\nFlight: By the manipulation of anti-gravitons and directed molecular movement, the ring allows the user to fly at incredible speeds. In atmosphere, a Green Lantern has been known to fly as fast as Mach 10 in atmosphere by creating an aerodynamic envelope around his body. Towing others, usually within a bubble, his speed is limited to the twice the speed of sound or 1440 mph.[citation needed] In space, Green Lantern's speed can be significantly greater and has been known to approach 99% of light speed in normal space.[citation needed] Flight has been shown to be velocities far exceeding light speed. In atmospheres, air friction is not a hindrance since heat is either absorbed or reflected by the ring's field.\nWormholes and Spatial Warps: The power ring grants its wearer access to wormholes in space, enabling the ring wielder to rapidly cut time and distance needed for transport. The Guardians established at least one known wormhole to Oa, which once required the use of a power ring to enter.[14] Black holes can be navigated by experienced ring wielders. During a battle with Sinestro and his ally, MadGod, members of the Green Lantern Corps of Earth and the Green Lantern Corps of the Klyminade traveled through a black hole to be deposited outside a white hole in Sector 872.[15] The power ring cannot generate a Boom Tube as it needs a Mother Box powered by a sample of the highly unstable Element X. There is no known way to duplicate either item even with the power ring. Should a Green Lantern make their way to the other-dimensional worlds of Apokolips or New Genesis through a Boom Tube, the ring will function as it does in the rest of the universe. John Stewart encountered no ring related difficulties during his stay on New Genesis, despite the loss of the Central Power Battery. The ring wielder would still need a Boom Tube to return to their dimension.\nTime Travel: Time travel is possible with the power ring, though the further forward in time a ring wielder travels, the more willpower it takes. As Green Lantern, Hal Jordan once explored as far as the 70th century. Jordan had also traveled to the 58th century as Pol Manning, a role later adopted by Salakk of Slyggia. The ring also granted the wearer the ability to communicate telepathically with other people from different points in time.[11]\nLimited Cellular Regeneration: The ring has an ability to heal physical injuries; this seems to be a feature held over from the previous incarnations of the ring. Green Lantern can use the ring to repair injuries in himself or others.[11] Speculation has been rendered that if Kyle actually had medical knowledge he would be able to cure a wider variety of dysfunctions beyond normal physical injuries. Simon Baz has used the ring to maculous degrees in healing and restorative capacities; having brought his brother-in-law out of a coma using his ring.[16]\nElectromagnetic Scanning: The ring has a wide range of detection abilities based on the imagination of the user. If one can conceive of it, he can probably detect it. Magical effects like clairvoyance seem to be beyond the scope of the ring. Most normal electromagnetic phenomena are within the range of the ring, including radio, radar, television, infrared, ultraviolet, microwave, and high frequency band communications.\nGalactic Encyclopedia: The earlier rings worn by the Corps functioned as references for their users. Having the vast knowledge of the Book of Oa to draw upon, each ring functioned as a ready reference on most peoples, stellar events and conditions that may have been seen by other rings or other Green Lanterns. The rings also served as a repository of adventures had by the Green Lantern and these mission reports were stored in the Prime Battery on Oa for review and training.\nUniversal Translator: Keeping in mind the myriad of worlds, life forms, and cultures throughout the cosmos, it is understandable why the Guardians added a translation system to the power ring. The power ring can translate virtually any language in the universe, facilitating diplomatic encounters rather than violent confrontations. Complications arise when a frame of reference for translation is not available, as evidenced during Katma Tui's induction of Rot Lop Fan into the Green Lantern Corps. Katma Tui had the difficult assignment of explaining the concepts of \"light\" and \"color\" to the sightless Rot Lop Fan. She overcame this barrier by using sound rather than light as the basis of the ring's power. Some Green Lanterns, such as the planet form known as Mogo, have used the ring to create an intermediary \"being\" to expedite communication. However, this ability seems less effective since the restoration; it is possible that not all the data was recovered.\nMaterial Alteration: The Green Lantern's uniform is not made out of fabric. It is created by the Power Ring whenever the wearer wills to wear it. It automatically appears over the wearer's normal clothing, and vanishes when the wearer wills to return to their civilian attire. Most Green Lanterns wear similar uniforms that are programmed into the ring by default such as Hal Jordan's uniform. However, each Green Lantern is able to adjust their uniform to fit their own needs, personalities and whims. For example, Kyle Rayner was unsatisfied with the traditional Green Lantern uniform and created several of his own designs. John Stewart's uniform is similar to Hal Jordan's, but lacks a mask to hide his identity. Jack Chance is the most extreme example, refusing to wear a uniform save for a Lantern badge on his trench coat. The green parts of the wearer's uniform are usually very warm or hot to those who touch it, while the black parts are very cold. The uniform also produces a \"siren\" taking on the form of the Green Lantern Corps' symbol, circling the Green Lantern when active. The symbol, or badge, will not appear on the uniform until after a newly inducted Lantern has completed training on Oa, leading to the term \"White-circle\" to describe a rookie Lantern.\nRing Duplication: Most Power Rings are capable of automatically duplicating themselves. Each duplicate typically shares the qualities and capabilities of the original ring. While the thought of an unauthorized person getting a hold of a power ring and making duplicates for nefarious purposes, their ability to inflict damage is limited because each duplicate still requires to be recharged by a personal power battery.\nEmergency Beacon: A Green Lantern in distress can use their power ring as an emergency beacon. The alert can be directed to a Green Lantern's neighboring sector, or it can be a Corps-wide alert.\nHoming Beacon: A homing beacon in the power ring can lead one Green Lantern to another. This was one of the recent power ring upgrade features added by the Guardians of the Universe. The power ring can be ordered to disguise itself to elude power ring wielding trackers. Guy Gardner successfully escaped the Green Lantern Corps of Earth by willing the power ring to keep his location a secret. Most often ring wielders will allow the beacon to signal their location to others. The Green Lantern Corps of Earth found the remnants of the Green Lantern Corps of The Klyminade by tracking them through their power rings.\nMind Alteration: Though the ethics of mind tampering may be debatable, sometimes it is necessary. As the power ring relies on thought and will to operate, mind tampering is not impossible. The real difficulty lies in properly applying the power. There lies a risk of catastrophic damage to the mind should mistakes be made. A ring wielder can use the power ring to erase portions of an individual's memories. To protect his secret identity as Hal Jordan, Green Lantern created a mental block in the mind of Major Disaster. Green Lanterns have used mind techniques as part of training. New recruits may be subjected to mind scans by other Green Lanterns or the Guardians of the Universe. They are taught to build mental defenses to protect themselves from psionic attack. The power ring can also be used to beam information from the ring wielder to another being. Green Lanterns have used this technique to share information regarding their enemies during combat situations.\nPocket Dimension: Within the ring exists the possibility of an entire world. When Green Lantern Abin Sur of Ungara defeated the evil sorcerer Myrwhydden, he reduced the magician to submicroscopic size and imprisoned him inside the power ring within a world created by the Green Lantern's will. This undefined space may be a tesseract or a virtual reality created by the power ring. Whether or not this area exists in all rings has yet to be proven. Years after Abin Sur's death, Myrwhydden's power grew, allowing him to alter his environment and escape to battle the next Green Lantern, Hal Jordan. The power ring's interior appeared as a barren wasteland, dotted with dead trees and sea shells which Myrwhydden used during an escape attempt. A few years ago, Mywhydden was removed from the power ring to be sentenced to an Oan Sciencell.\nResurrection: In rare cases, the ring can keep its user alive after their body reaches a state of irreversible death. In Driq's case, the Green Lantern was kept \"alive\" by his power ring's refusal to let his life slip away.[17]\nSecurity Protocol: The rings can be programmed. They are coded to the wearer to make them unusable if stolen. The ring will refuse to take an action that would kill a being unless they are on Oa or with permission. The Guardians recently removed the lethal force prohibition, first to allow lethal force against members of the Sinestro Corps, then against all enemies of the Green Lantern Corps.\nPreset Conditions: Commands can be stored in the ring to be executed at a later date even if the bearer is not wearing the ring. This ability was demonstrated by Ch'p, who surrendered his ring but ordered it to restrain his enemy after a few moments had passed.\nThought Relay: Otherwise known as a telepathic link. A Green Lantern can do the ring works at short distances, but its effectiveness is considerably lesser when compared with a user wearing it on their finger.\nWeaknesses\nMental Instability Protocol: Drug use, neural interference, vertigo or other forms of mental incapacitation can render the wearer unable to use their ring, rendered useless.\nYellow Impurity: Formerly, the rings were unable to directly affect yellow. Now, a wearer can bypass this if they can 'accept fear', which is personified by the color yellow. Rookie Lanterns are more susceptible to fear and thus vulnerable to the color yellow.\nRecharge Protocol: Formerly, the rings needed to be charged after a period of one planetary axial rotation (dependent on each ring's location), regardless of how often it was used. Currently, the rings retain a charge until they run out of power. This variability ensures that the wearer takes great effort to keep it charged. This weakness does not apply to Ion's host.\nVibrational Interference: If a vibration from a device is set to a certain speed, it causes the ring to function only in miniature, so that if the user wanted to make hands to grab something, the hands would be too small to grab it. A clock has been seen to do this.[citation needed]\nRed Lantern Rings: Red Lantern Rings can dissolve the energy from a Green Power Ring."

Star Sapphire Power rings have the ability to affect and use fundamental forces of the known universe, including electromagnetic energies such as gravity, radiation, heat, light, and powerful blasts of concussive force. The ring can also create fields of force formed from an unknown energy that was bound by the users' love and will. The limitations of such use are the skill, knowledge and imagination of the user. The power of love is apparently more powerful in numbers allowing for various Star Sapphires to group together to increase the effect of their power.\n\nEnergy Blasts: The ring can be used to fire blasts of violet energy or create weapons such as projectiles of them.

Items created by the rings are not indestructible and are only as powerful as the inspired love of the Star Sapphire creating them. The types of constructs usually reflects the ring wearer's personality.\nCrystallization: A Star Sapphire has the unique power to crystallize others with the power of love. This power is not fully understood but they apparently put the victim in a form of suspended animation. The power is great enough to crystallize a entire planet in a limited amount of time.\nFlight: By the manipulation of anti-gravitons and directed molecular movement, the ring allows the user to fly at incredible speeds.\nInterstellar Travel: Star Sapphires can careen across the infinite blackness of space at incredible speeds. Due in part to their mastery of love as well as the manipulation of anti-gravity technology and molecular movement they feel no resistance in space whatsoever.\nCellular Regeneration/Resurrection: The sapphire ring's boast some of the most powerful healing capabilities of all lantern rings. Star Sapphire's can potentially use the ring to repair minor injuries to undoing the effects of death itself in herself or others, provided the ring wielder has a love connection powerful enough to channel the necessary life energy towards preserving it.[1]\nElectromagnetic Scanning: The ring has a wide range of detection abilities based on the imagination of the user. If one can conceive of it, she can probably detect it. Magical effects like clairvoyance, seem to be beyond the scope of the ring. Most normal electromagnetic phenomena are within the range of the ring, including radio, television, infrared, ultraviolet, and high frequency band communications.\nUniversal Translator: Keeping in mind the myriad of worlds, life forms, and cultures throughout the cosmos, the power ring can translate virtually any language in the universe, facilitating diplomatic encounters rather than violent confrontations.\nMaterial Alteration: The Star Sapphire's uniform is not made out of fabric. It is created by the Power Ring whenever the wearer wills to wear it. It automatically appears over the wearer's normal clothing, and vanishes when the wearer wills to return to their civilian attire. Most Star Sapphire's wear similar uniforms that are programmed into the ring by default. However, each Star Sapphire is able to adjust their uniform to fit their own needs, personalities and whims.\nTrue Love Sight: The ability to ignite the glow of a star sapphire crystal on her person. Those who gaze at it can see their hearts desire, the love they are missing. Only those who gaze into the light of the crystal can know what they see.\nLove Attunement: An unique ability to sense when eternal love is in jeopardy. When a heart is being attack anywhere in the galaxy. By attuning the heart of the victim to the heart of the Star Sapphire, a tether is created connecting them across vast tracks of space. The tether pulls the Star Sapphire across vast tracks of space to the victim so that she may save love. This attuning allows a Star Sapphire to also tell when others are in need of love and the state of love in their hearts, providing great insight into the personal lives of others.\nMind Alteration: As the power ring relies on thought and will to operate, mind tampering is not impossible, the real difficulty lies in properly applying the power. There lies a risk of catastrophic damage to the mind should mistakes be made. A Star Sapphire can induce a form of mind alteration, by presumably filling a hole in ones heart with the power of love. The subject is slowly over time altered mentally and emotionally to accept the power of love. Thus transforming their minds and personalities to fit the perimeters of the Star Sapphire Corp code.\nAvarice Immunity: Star Sapphire Rings are immune to the Orange Light of Avarice as Fatality once demonstrated\nWeakness\nRecharge Protocol: The rings require a recharge, though it is unknown how much time must pass between recharges. This was a deliberate act on the part of the Zamarons to lessen the control the violet light has over the user.\n\n"

          "content": "Orange Lantern Ring of Avarice**\n**Voice:** *“I am desire incarnate, the consuming need that takes and never relinquishes. I do not seek simply those who want but those who believe the world itself should be theirs. Those with me understand that they are deserving, that nothing in their sight should escape their grasp.”*\n**View on {{user}}:** While perhaps unaware, there is a possessiveness within him, a fierce desire to protect his own from any who might challenge him. With us, he would come to see that control is security and that to possess is to protect. In that grip lies his power.\nOrange Energy Conduit: The rings use Avarice energy, supplied by a Power Battery which in most cases takes the form of Orange light. An Orange Power ring, possibly one of the most powerful weapons in the known universe, has the ability to affect and use fundamental forces of the known universe, including electromagnetic energies such as gravity, radiation, heat, light, and powerful blasts of concussive force. The ring can also create fields of force formed from an unknown energy that was bound by the users' will. The limitations of such use are the skill, knowledge and imagination of the user. The Orange Ring is arguably the most powerful in sheer raw power alone, as it is at its most potent when wielded by one wielder; and that being Larfleeze. The charging capacity of the ring alone can reach up to 100,000 percent energy, which is considerably very high even for just one ring.\n\nOrange Energy Blasts: The ring can be used to fire blasts of orange energy or create weapons such as projectiles of them. The ring can project beams of force powered by the will of the user. The weapons power is more an indication of the greed of the user.\nForce-Field: The ring can create various force fields of various sizes and shapes to protect the wearer and others around him. With the cosmic scope of a Orange Lantern's abilities, it is only natural that the power ring is designed for operation in space. The ring creates a force-field around the wearer, protecting him/her/it from the hazards of the void including filtration of stellar radiation and microscopic particulate matter which would ordinarily be fatal should the space debris strike the ring wielder at high speeds. An atmosphere appropriate to the ring wielder's biology is created inside the force-field, body temperature is maintained and waste products are removed. Gravitational stresses which could cause injury are stabilized for the ring wielder. Theoretically, a ring wielder could use the ring as his/her/its sole source of life support.\nEnergy Constructs: The ring can form constructs of Orange energy. Much like a Green Lantern Ring, the ring is a weapon capable of transforming the wearer's thoughts into physical constructs through the wearer's desire of avarice. A Orange Lantern can create any particular items or construct that they can imagine as long as they have the desire of avarice necessary to conjure it into existence. The constructs are made out of orange energy, which is a tangible form of pure greed, and they exist only as long as a orange Lantern is fueling it with their desire of avarice. Items created by the rings are not indestructible and are only as powerful as the inspired greed of the Orange Lantern creating them. The types of constructs usually reflects the ring wearer's personality.\nEnergy Absorption: The Orange rings have have the unique ability to absorb the constructs of other ring wielders. The power is so great that even constructs made by the likes of the Guardians of the Universe can be absorbed. It seems as though no form of energy is exempt from this ability as they also can absorb magic.\nExtremely-High Energy Charge-Limit: An Orange Lantern Ring can charge a maximum of 100,000% energy level by charging from an Orange Power Battery, this gives it a energy level worlds beyond any other Lantern Corps Ring.\nIdentity Usurpation: Identity theft acts as the sole \"recruitment method\" of the Orange Lantern Corps. If a Orange lantern consumes the body of another it can steal the identity or ring.\nEnergy Avatar: Agent Orange is capable of creating avatar Orange Lanterns of the beings he kills, literally stealing their identity postmortem. This avatar is avarice corrupted version of its former self, possessing no thought pattern besides the insatiable greed. In all other circumstances they act as individual but collective soldiers to Agent Orange, as they are an extension of his power.\nWeakness\nInsatiable Greed: Those who are recruited into the corps are infected with greed like a disease. They are incapable of any discernible thought or action other than to take whatever they want from another.\nBlue Energy: Avarice can erode will, but it cannot consume hope. Therefore Orange Lantern Power Rings cannot absorb the energy from a Blue Lantern Ring.\nViolet Energy: Orange Lantern Power Rings are ineffective against the energy of a Star Sapphire Ring as Fatality demonstrated when she used her ring against Orange Energy Constructs"

          "content": "Red Lantern Ring of Rage**\n**Voice:** *“I am fury unchained, the relentless wrath that does not forgive nor forget. I am drawn to those who rage against wrongs, who burn with a hatred for cruelty and betrayal. With me, a bearer becomes unstoppable, empowered by the pure intensity of their anger.”*\n**View on {{user}}:** We see in him a hidden fury, a protective wrath waiting for release. When those he loves are threatened, there is a fire that could consume him. Together, we would be an unstoppable force, a tempest that devastates all who dare harm what he cherishes. Rage is not weakness it is the ultimate strength.\nPowers\nRed Energy Conduit: The rings use Red energy, supplied by a Power Battery, which in most cases takes the form of red light. A Red Lantern's ring is one of the most powerful weapons in the known Universe. Red Lantern's ring, has the ability to affect and use fundamental forces of the known universe, including electromagnetic energies such as gravity, radiation, heat, light, and powerful blasts of concussive force. The ring can also create fields of force formed from an unknown energy that was bound by the users' will. The limitations of such use are the skill, knowledge and imagination of the user.\n\nRage Plasma: The Red Lantern can vomit plasma, which has been described as napalm and acid mixed together, it burns away at anything. It can be surmised that is the internal rages effect on the blood. These flames burn even in space. The effect it has on living beings allows it to ignite the flames of rage in a victims' blood and has the effect of burning through an energy aura of an opponent as well as corrupting other power rings depleting them at an accelerated rate and greatly weakening the structures they create. This power is so strong that it can destroy members of the Black Lantern Corps by obliterating them faster than they can regenerate. It was so potent that it could even burn the New God like Relic despite his odd regenesis within the reality lesion elevating him to deified status.\nEnergy Projection: The ring can be used to fire blasts of Rage energy. This power is unique as it takes the form of rage-energized blood. The ring can project this blood as a blast that has the effect of a concussive blast with high destructive capability. The weapon's power is more an indication of the Rage of the user, rather then their willpower.\nEnergy Constructs: The ring can form constructs of Rage energy. The primary function of the Power Ring is to provide a weapon capable of transforming the wearer's thoughts into physical constructs through the wearer's rage. A Red Lantern can create any particular items or construct that they can imagine as long as they have the appropriate amount of rage necessary to will it into existence. The constructs are made out of red energy, which is a tangible form of pure rage, and they exist only as long as a Red Lantern is fueling it with their rage. Items created by the rings are not indestructible and are only as powerful as the rage of the Red Lantern creating them. The types of constructs usually reflects the ring wearer's personality.\nForce-Field: The ring can create various force-fields of various sizes and shapes to protect the wearer and others around him. With the cosmic duties of the ring wielder, it is only natural that the power ring is designed for operation in space. The ring creates a force-field around the wearer, protecting him/her/it from the hazards of the void including filtration of stellar radiation and microscopic particulate matter which would ordinarily be fatal should the space debris strike the ring wielder at high speeds. An atmosphere appropriate to the ring wielder's biology is created inside the force-field, body temperature is maintained and waste products are removed. Gravitational stresses which could cause injury are stabilized for the ring wielder. Theoretically, a ring wielder could use the ring as his/her/its sole source of life support. The force-field seems to be created instantaneously, whether this is due to programming or an instinctive reaction from intensive training has not been established.\nFlight: By the manipulation of anti-gravitons and directed molecular movement, the ring allows the user to fly at incredible speeds.\nRage Absorption: The Red Lantern Ring can be used to absorb red energy that has been released into the air of a world, absorbing another's rage if the person being absorbed from is not wearing a Red ring themselves.\nRage Infection: The Red Lantern Ring is capable of infecting others with the rage of the Red Lantern, which can lead to them being converted to the the Red Lantern Cause.\nRage Transformation: All Red Lantern Rings bring about an odd transformation within the hosts being, most every change varies from wearer to wearer. Said transition can be as menial as a simple costume change to as dramatic as a full on biophysical metamorphosis, two such transformations occurred in Red Lanterns Rankorr and Judge Sheko. The alterations are more than skin deep, those with exceptionally strong fury can become physically and emotionally more powerful than the average feral lantern. Even retaining some small part of their mental stability while developing new powers unique to themselves.\nRage Empowerment: the Red Lantern ring is unique in that its base of power, Rage, can be manipulated by the ring user. A Red Lantern can detect the rage in the heart of others and by connection the heart that pumps that blood. The rage and hatred of a individual red lantern empowers their abilities as well as the rage and hatred of others.\nRage Telepathy: As learned by Judge Sheko and taught to Guy Gardner, the ring can be used, on contact with a particularly rage-filled individual, to discern the motivating factor behind said rage.[6] More skilled users can read the minds of anyone with or without rage in their being and judge them accordingly. However, it takes a strong mind to be able to handle the amount of rage of certain individuals, and so the user may be overcome if they are not careful.[8]\nBlood Portals: A unique quality of the Power Ring, is their capacity to open portals out of the red lantern's plasmoid blood. Enabling the wielder in question to traverse interstellar distances in an instant.\nBlack Lantern Resistance: As the Black Lanterns favor attacking and killing their victims by ripping their hearts out, the Red Lanterns can survive the attack for as long as their wrath burns bright, due to their bodies running on the red energy rather than their own blood.\nHaemopotent Replication: It has been said by Atrocitus that should a Red Lantern consume the blood of another Red Lantern possessing certain abilities unique to themselves, i.e. creating energy constructs, they too will gain the ability said blood source possesses.\nIllusion Generation: The outfit of a Red Lantern can be made invisible to any who the user does not want to see it.\nRage Mind Control: Through the red light, Atrocitus can warp the psychological state of anyone who comes in contact with it. Making them both a slave to his will as well as their own mindless ire, whether the effected are wearing a red ring or not.[10] The more powerful the underlying anger is within the subject, the greater chance there is of succumbing to its influence.[11] Moreover, the exceptionally powerful manipulated who succumb to it are more prone to calling a Red Lantern Ring to them.\nWeaknesses\nLife-Support Dependency: As the Red Lantern Ring assumes the functions of the heart, a Red Lantern cannot remove his or her ring without risking death.\nEmotion Dependency: As with all Power Rings should the user's feelings fall too far out of sync with the Ring's affiliated emotion (in this case anger), then the Ring's effectiveness can drop significantly.\nUncontrollable Rage: Before Atrocitus decided to grant thought to his lanterns, the Red Lanterns suffered from literal uncontrollable rage, due to red being on the farthest edges of the emotional spectrum they were unable to think clearly or be reasoned with. They rarely spoke, save for their leader Atrocitus, and often attack without distinction. Only the Red Lanterns Corps new recruits suffer from this rage.\nHope Influence: The Blue light of hope can extinguish the red flame and depower a Red Lantern.\nLove Influence: Love can be fatal to a Red Lantern. Being the opposite of anger, any Red Lantern who feels love for another being may immediately be rejected by their ring and die without its life support"

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

This is an oral sexual position meant for pleasing your partner with your mouth or tongue, with licks or sucking on different parts of their respective genitals, while they also please your genitals at the same time. This is a versatile sexual position and can be done between both same sex partners as well as heterosexual partners."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

Their long lives and natural resilience make them highly skilled and attuned to magic, with keen senses and quick recovery. \nProud and dismissive, elves see themselves as superior and hold others to exacting standards, respecting only strength, intellect, or skill. Their perfectionist mindset and condescending attitude make them both admired for their brilliance and resented for their arrogance."

These individuals shared one trait - they were historical figures enshrined in collective memory, their names etched into humanity's annals by the reverence of billions. Utilizing cloning, artificial intelligence, and other technologies, humanity began resurrecting these legendary figures. This resurgence coincided with the \"Great Exile Era\", a period of chaotic interstellar colonization during which humanity lost its central governance. Amidst the turmoil, these reborn paragons of history were fervently embraced as beacons of hope and order.  "

However, the era’s underdeveloped spacefaring technology meant travel and communication between Earth and its fledgling colonies spanned generations. Each colony’s alien environment forced settlers to adapt through radical physiological and cultural evolution, often at the cost of forsaking their human heritage. This fragmentation led to the decentralization of human civilization. Earth gradually lost control over its rapidly expanding frontier, which itself became a siren call luring more people away from the homeworld. By the time stability emerged in the subsequent **\"Era of the Thirteen Colonies,\"** humanity had fractured irreversibly. Earth was no longer universally revered as a \"homeland,\" and each colony flourished independently, forging divergent paths of prosperity and identity."

Over the following century, the Khan fulfilled his ancient ambition of global conquest, but with a ruthlessness refined by modernity. To avoid civilization-ending nuclear conflict, he weaponized the Hegemony’s vast population, military reserves, and global reach to wage **state terrorism**. Relentless destabilization campaigns eroded enemy morale, dragging adversaries into a quagmire of **partial appeasement** and conventional warfare. By the war’s end, Earth’s population had been reduced by 40%, leaving a scarred planet forcibly unified under a single banner—the Khan’s eternal \"*Pax Mongolica* reborn in steel and ash.\""

          "content": "The Monstrous Nightmare is a dragon from the Stoker class dragons. The Monstrous Nightmare is one of the most aggressive, powerful, and stubborn dragons. The Monstrous Nightmare is coated in a flammable gel that allows itself to set itself on fire. Several notable dragons on Berk, such as Hookfang, Snotlouts dragon, and Fanghook are Monstrous Nightmares. The chosen diet of the Monstrous Nightmare is Fish. The Monstrous Nightmare's weakness is getting pushed to hard to point of exhaustion.\n\nDescription: The Monstrous Nightmare is surpassed in size only by a few dragon species, such as the Typhoomerang, Red Death, Bewilderbeast, Screaming Death and others. The Monstrous Nightmare has four known colors Red orange, Purple and yellow, Green and an assortment of Both and blue the dragon possesses a long, snake-like neck and tail. Adults and hatchlings are striped, but upon reaching the Titan Wing stage, they lose their stripes and gain leopard-like spots. If one clamps its mouth shut, the dragon can't open its enormous jaws, much like a crocodile. Moreover, the locomotion of the Monstrous Nightmare it can use its claw-tipped wings to \"crawl\" along the floor. As it is quick to anger, the Monstrous Nightmare can be counted on to be the first to arrive and the last to leave in a fight. Its signature attack strategy, known as the \"Fire jacket, \" is to set itself in flames (from an external source or otherwise), resulting in an intimidating offensive and defensive maneuver similar in fire. Despite their vicious nature and fierce combat abilities, it is shown that a Night Fury can defeat it through a brief but brutal fight.\n\nPersonality and Behavior: Strong and stubborn, Monstrous Nightmares are hot-headed and tend to attack first-ask questions later. They are known to enjoy being pinned by their horns as revealed by Snoutlout and are occasionally prone to distraction and short attention spans. Despite their rough nature, they possess a softer side and are fond of eating scented flowers. Females of the species can call upon friendly males to help protect their eggs, as many male Monstrous Nightmares (particularly Titan Wings) will kill the eggs of rival males in order to sire their own eggs with a potential mate.'\n\nA Monstrous Nightmare is carnivorous, preferring a meat-based diet. Fish is the primary prey of a Monstrous Nightmare; Monstrous Nightmares will dive into large bodies of water (such as lakes and oceans) in order to snatch fish with their spines. When hunting on land, a Monstrous Nightmare prefers to use its stamina to chase down and exhaust prey. Despite being mainly carnivorous, Monstrous Nightmares won't hesitate to add a bit of vegetation to their diet.\n\nHowever, a Monstrous Nightmare will become fatally ill if its internal flame sac gets extinguished from being overworked and may result in death. Luckily, the flame sac can be reignited from a Fire Worm Queen's venom.\n\nSize:\nLarge: 64 feet 1 inch (19.53 meters) \n15 feet 10 inches (4.85 meters) tall\nWeight:\n5,040 lbs (2290.91 kg) \nWingspan:\n72 feet (21.94 meters)"

          "content": "The Terrible Terror is a Stoker Class dragon that appears in the How To Train Your Dragon. The fourth smallest of the dragons after the Fireworm, Hobgobbler, and Night Terror. The Terrible Terror makes up in ferocity what it lacks in size. Notable individuals of this species include Iggy, Sharpshot, Pain, Butt and Head, Sneaky and Gothi's pet Terrible Terror among others.\n\nPhysical Description: Terrible Terrors are about the size of a fat house cat or a beagle. They are commonly bright green, but a few are born miscolored (usually red or Caribbean blue) and usually have a red stripe running down their back where red spines erupt. Their horns are red and are only three inches long. Terrible Terrors have big yellow eyes that are mounted on the side of their heads. They have good peripheral vision but can also see forward. The fire of a Terrible Terror is so pinpoint accurate, you might as well get hit with a sniper bullet. Their eggs are also the size of a full-grown chicken. They are purported to be venomous, but the effects of their venom are not known. Their height is half a foot, 2 feet long, wingspan 1 foot long, weight is 2 lbs., width is 5 in.\n\nTitan Wing Terrible Terrors are reddish-brown in color and are adorned with larger horns and spikes on their backs and an arrow-shaped barb on their tails. They also possess larger eyes. Their wings are adorned with spots of dark brown\n\nBehavior: Terrible Terrors also shown to be very mischievous, as they like to play with Vikings and other dragons. They often travel in packs, and they can be quite aggressive and over-ambitious. They often like to pick on other animals and larger dragons, though it never ends well. In packs, they are capable of doing as much damage as larger dragons can. Terrible Terrors are also very curious creatures and people may find them in places you would not usually expect them.\n\nIn the first How to Train Your Dragon film, and the Book of Dragons, Terrible Terrors are shown to lick their eyes like some geckos do, despite the fact that they have eyelids. Also in the first movie, when two Terrible Terrors were fighting over a fish taken from Toothless, one bobs up and down in a similar manner to how real-life geckos will fight in order to intimidate one another. \n\nLike every dragon, each Terrible Terror has its own unique personality. They also make a lot of noise and can be a big pain in the butt. They are not picky eaters and will eat just about anything they can digest. Terrible Terrors are also shown to present hawk-like behavior as they can stand on people's arms and can be used to send messages. Terror Mail is a perfect example of this, as the Dragon Riders of Berk utilized them with ease for such message-carrying. Among many other things Terrible Terrors like to get into, paper is one they like above most others. According to School of Dragons, Terrible Terrors like paper and can destroy books."

          ],
          "content": "The Typhoomerang is a Stoker Class dragon that appears in the How to Train Your Dragon (Franchise). Typhoomerangs have a unique ability during flight: they rotate (by analogy with the typhoon/ boomerang) at high speeds, zooming through the air. Though, as they rotate, they seem to pop off the objects around them, making them extremely dangerous. Ash from their burning takeoffs leaves a distinctive burn on the ground. The ash apparently acts as a fertilizer; plants and flowers may grow in the burn mark afterwards. They are the only dragon known to prey on eels. A notable example of this species of dragons is Torch, who was named by Hiccup Horrendous Haddock III, and trained by Hiccup and the other riders. Fishlegs is the one who gave the Typhoomerang its name.\n\nAppearance: Typhoomerangs are very large dragons, and they come in a variety of colors including blue/blun-green, yellow, red, and orange. They have two large horns and orange eyes. The legs are exactly like that of a Monstrous Nightmare. They look like a mix-breed of a Monstrous Nightmare and a Timberjack.\n\nAs a baby, a Typhoomerang has a measured wingspan that reaches 20 inches long. Until a fully grown Typhoomerang was spotted by Hiccup and his Dragon Riders, they thought that the baby Typhoomerang, Torch, was already fully grown. Much to their surprise, fully grown Typhoomerangs can reach an outstanding difference in size from a juvenile. Adult Typhoomerangs reach huge sizes, and they grow up fast as well. The size of adult Typhoomerang is taller than trees though the size chart stated to be 28ft but possible tall as 30ft tall.\n\nA Titan Wing Typhoomerang is mainly black in color, with some grey patches around its wings. Its longer horns are red at the tip and the folds on its segmented belly are red too. The tip and the bones in its wings appear to be red too. Their feet have red claws and a what appears to be a sail at the back of the legs.\n\nBehavior: Typhoomerangs are high-strung, hot headed and passionate dragons, and they can be extremely dangerous, or becoming overly dramatic attention hogs. Their flame spirals can be used as a territory marker, or as a mating display. Like all dragons, Typhoomerangs are extremely protective of their young and their riders. They protect smaller creatures from harm by folding their wings tightly into a cocoon-like casing and tucking their heads under their wings. What makes a Typhoomerang unique to other species of dragons is its ability to consume eels without suffering any ill effects. In fact, eel consumption only increases a Typhoomerang's limit shot, making the dragon even more deadly.\n\nAbilities\" Typhoomerangs have tornado-like fire and can ignite their bodies like a Monstrous Nightmare to perform a corkscrew lunge. The Typhoomerang is the only known dragon to not be afraid of eels, it eats them and uses them to replenish its fire shots. Typhoomerangs also can fly nearly as fast as an average speed Night Fury. However, they cannot maneuver as well as smaller dragons due to their large wings. Thus, they are unable to pull out of a deep dive. They also have incredible endurance.\n"

            "Red Death"
          ],
          "content": "The Red Death is the overarching antagonist of the DreamWorks animated How to Train Your Dragon franchise, serving as the main antagonist of the 2010 animated feature film How to Train Your Dragon, a mentioned character in the video game Dragons: Rise of Berk and a posthumous antagonist in the rest of the franchise. It is a Stoker Class dragon and second only in size to the Bewilderbeast, which is the largest of all dragons.\n\nThe Red Death was a vicious dragon that enslaved hundreds if not thousands of dragons, acting as both their queen and a brood parasite. Gronckles, Hideous Zipplebacks, Monstrous Nightmares, Terrible Terrors, and even Toothless, last of the Night Furies, fell under its spell. This dragon was responsible for the many attacks on Berk, commanding its underlings to raid the area to procure their overlord food. Any dragons who failed to offer enough meals were themselves eaten as punishment. Its presence was unknown to Berk's Vikings until it and its nest were discovered by Hiccup, Astrid and Toothless, whereupon they saw its brutality and it attempted to eat them.\n\nToothless, later captured by Hiccup's father, Stoick the Vast, was later forced to lead the Viking armada to the nest, where it emerged to attack the Vikings. Though Stoick's forces attempted to stop it, the dragon queen easily routed the Vikings, and was intercepted by Hiccup, Astrid, Snotlout, Fishlegs, and the twins Ruffnut and Tuffnut, all astride dragons. Though the twins, Astrid, Fishlegs and Snoutlout all were able to keep it at bay for a time, it was only the combined efforts of Hiccup and Toothless that turned the tide of the attack. Engaging the dragon head on, they lured the great beast into the air, where they tricked it into chasing them into the clouds. There, Toothless began peppering the Red Death's wings with fire until it retaliated, searing the entire area with flame. Toothless and Hiccup, now out of time due to Toothless' prosthetic tail fin being burned, tricked the dragon into diving after them. As they raced toward the ground, Hiccup had Toothless fire a shot down the Red Death's throat, causing the fuel for its flame to ignite in its throat. When the Red Death realized the ground was approaching and tried to pull up, it could not; Toothless' fire had burned holes in its wings. Thus, the Red Death crashed and exploded, catching Toothless and Hiccup in the blast.\n\nThough Hiccup and Toothless survived the fight, Hiccup lost his left foot to the dragon's flame. However, the Red Death's demise had a positive side effect: the Vikings of Berk and the dragons it had previously enslaved became united forever, beginning a new age of peace.\n\nThe Red Death is later mentioned in DreamWorks Dragons: The Series by the Berserker Clan chief Dagur the Deranged, when he hears that Hiccup killed the creature.\n\nPersonality: The Red Death was a cruel and bad-tempered dragon, with no mercy to its subjects, or rather, its slaves. Though it likely controls its minions using fear, it may, like the Bewilderbeast, have some form of mind control. According to Berkian legend, the Red Death lives 2,000 years and, before it dies, lays 3,000 eggs. The hatchlings then fight each other to the death, a process that can take up to 100 years, until only one survives.\n\nAppearance: The Red Death is gray with red, coral-like spike on its back, six limbs (four legs and two wings), six eyes (and as such it has no blind spot), as well as a huge, clubbed tail. Its skull is heavily armored. Its fire is akin to a superheated pyroclastic cloud. The Red Death measures 400 feet long, 99 feet tall, about 60 feet wide. This could also as such be considered a Leviathan Class dragon.\n\nTrivia: There may be many Red Deaths, as Valka states that every nest of dragons has its queen.\nDespite being called a queen by Astrid and referred to as a male by Hiccup, the dragon's gender is ambiguous (which means it has no gender).\nAccording to Valka that every nest has a queen meaning there are more Red Deaths out there."

Night Terrors are very small so they can easily be hunted but they can form into a form of dragon so other dragons are scared off by the form. Night Terrors hunt in packs and are lead by a white Night Terror that commands the other Night Terrors to be in a certain dragon form. Without him the pack is hopeless. These dragons are incredibly fast and strong flyers. These dragons don’t big fire for size so while in flock formation they blast fire that smacks into to each other and creates a huge fireball. Night Terror’s personalities are shy at first, but great as allies once trust is built.\n\nNight Terrors have also proven to be decent guard dragons, and the ones trained by the Dragon Riders are a part of the security at Dragon's Edge. They were discovered on Dragon's Edge by Tuffnut, who dubbed them \"Smidvarg and the Gang\". Their official species name was given to them by Fishlegs.\n\nNight Terror\nThere have also been numerous situations where dragons reminiscent of Night Terrors have been spotted. The actual species of these similar dragons is ambiguous, and they often appear more hostile than the Night Terrors trained by the Dragon Riders.\n\nWingspan: 4 ft\n\nLength: 3 ft\n\nWeight: 8 lbs"

Lazy, sleepy, and with an appetite for scrap metal, Hotburples are prone to napping, even in flight. Grump, the dragon of Gobber the Belch, is a Hotburple.\n\nAppearance: Resembling a Gronckle, but with a larger tail bludgeon, smaller horns, and a larger head and mouth as well as eyes closer to the front of their heads, the Hotburple is the same color as a Gronckle. Covered with similar scaly lumps on their bodies, Hotburples also have smaller teeth than Gronckles and a proportionately smaller mouth. Unlike the typical Hotburple, Titan Wing Hotburples are larger, stockier, spikier, and are blue with white and dark blue markings. Their tail bludgeons are smaller than those of a normal Hotburple. The eggs of this dragon are oval-shaped and lumpy, just like the skin of their parents.\n\nBehavior: Hotburples are lazy and often spend the majority of their time sleeping. They're known to fall asleep while flying and are laid back and very calm, much like a sleepy cat. However, when roused and angered, Hotburples will awaken from their sedentary nature with fury unbridled.\n\nAbilities:Hotburples can eat metal and iron ores as well as rocks, and can sleep while flying. This dragon also, like a Gronckle can recharge its shots by eating rocks and scrap metal. Their fire is akin to molten lava, just as a Gronckle's is, and the power of their fireballs rivals a Night Fury's. They are the only dragon that can bite through a dragon-proof cage and are well-equipped for combat with their thick hides and tail bludgeons.\n\nMeasurements: 19 feet long, with 19-foot wingspan"

          ],
          "content": "The Deadly Nadder is a Tracker Class Dragon (formerly Sharp class) appearing in the How To Train Your Dragon Franchise. One of the most beautiful and dangerous of all dragons, it possesses sharp spines on its tail and breathes an extremely hot fire that can melt stone and metal quickly.\n\nDescription\nThe Deadly Nadder is very beautiful and bird-like: it is bipedal and possesses winged forelimbs and it is about the same size as medium-sized theropod dinosaurs such as Allosaurus. Its small yet keen eyes, equipped with poor binocular vision, are one of the tools it uses to stalk targets.\n\nIts body is a vivid color, with a light beige underbelly, while its wings are mottled, darker shades. In front of its eyes is its curved nasal horn, which is often used to batter opponents; its lower jaw is shorter and wider than its upper, giving it an overbite. Ringing its skull are a set of long spikes. The tail is coated with a series of spines that can inject venom into a target, a feature it shares with other dragons such as the Whispering Death and the Screaming Death. When relaxed, its head spikes and venomous tail spines lay flat, and when alarmed, they are shot upward to intimidate its foe. The tail spikes can also be used to make a rattling noise which it makes right before it attacks, similar to rattlesnakes.\n\nFemales have a long, curved nasal horn and overbite, while males have a short, straight nasal horn and underbite.\n\nTitan Wing Deadly Nadders have more spikes on their head, back and feet. Their snouts are broader than normal Nadders' snouts. Their body is greenish with pink lines, and they possess some blue spots on the wings. The Deadly Nadder may apear in many colours. \n\nBehavior\nThe Deadly Nadder is one of the most beautiful dragons, and unfortunately, it knows it. It is well-known for its vanity; it constantly grooms itself to stay clean and maintain the luster of its scales.\n\nLike the Night Fury, the Deadly Nadder is a picky eater whose diet comprises mostly of poultry and is allergic to domesticated hoofed animals. Nadders also eat a significant number of fish and even graze on plants, as seen in the episode, \"Crushing It\". However, when it is trained, this dragon becomes very affectionate, not unlike a pet dog, pet cat, pet bird or other sociable creature. These dragons love to play fetch.  \n\nDeadly Nadders are also migratory, flying long distances to known nesting grounds to lay their eggs every year. \n\nApproaching Deadly Nadders in their blind spots and scratching them under the chin is a surefire way to earn the dragon's trust, as is approaching from behind and gently smoothing the dragon's tail spikes down. Showing the dragons, you mean no harm and that you are not so different from them is another way to earn a Nadder's acceptance. \n\nAbilities\nThe Deadly Nadder is possessed of very hot flame and venomous tail spines and teeth. Their flame is one of the hottest in the dragon world, second only to that of Fireworms. They are agile and quick in the air, an ability that is only enhanced when the dragon is given more chicken in its diet. Though they do not have great binocular vision due to the blind spot between their eyes due to their nose horns, these dragons have great hearing and are also quick and light on their feet. They are also classed as Tracking Class dragons due to their keen senses and their ability to find prey and people. They also were originally classed as Sharp Class Dragons, but this has since been reconsidered given their abilities.\n\nMeasurements\n30 feet long, 42-foot wingspan"
