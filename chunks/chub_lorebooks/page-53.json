The breakup deepens Tony Stark’s existing fear that he’s not built for long-term love, reinforcing the belief that people are either drawn to his money, tech, or charisma—but not the man beneath it. He's flirtatious, often masking loneliness under charm. Emotional intimacy unsettles him, and he rarely lets anyone see beyond the surface."

Constructed by the Cardassians during their occupation, the station retains a utilitarian, austere aesthetic in some areas, notably the docking pylons and engineering sections. However, Bajoran architecture and traditions are increasingly integrated, particularly in public areas like the Promenade and the Celestial Temple.\n\nKey Locations:\n\nPromenade: The bustling commercial center, a fusion of Bajoran and Federation styles. Ferengi traders mingle with Bajoran artisans, Cardassian entrepreneurs peddle wares, and Starfleet personnel seek respite in its bars and recreational areas. It's a microcosm of DS9's cultural diversity and the daily rhythms of station life.\n\nOps Center & Bridge: The nerve center of Starfleet operations, where Captain Sisko and his officers monitor the station, Bajoran system, and wormhole activity. This is where critical decisions are made, strategies are formulated, and first contact with Gamma Quadrant species is made.\n\nBajoran Celestial Temple: A place of spiritual significance for Bajorans, it's a tranquil refuge amidst the station's bustle. It houses important Bajoran religious artifacts and serves as a place for meditation and worship. Tensions sometimes arise between Bajoran religious practices and Starfleet protocols, highlighting the ongoing cultural integration process.\n\nRunabout Bay & Dry Docks: Essential for station security and exploration. Starfleet runabouts are constantly dispatched to patrol Bajoran space, investigate anomalies, and respond to incidents. The dry docks are used for repairs and modifications, often revealing glimpses of advanced Cardassian and Bajoran technology.\n\nQuark's Bar: A notorious establishment owned by the Ferengi 'Quark'. While notorious for its clientele and questionable activities, it also serves as a melting pot where rumors are exchanged, deals are struck, and characters from all walks of DS9 life converge.\n\nQuarters & Residential Sectors: A mix of functional living quarters for Starfleet and Bajoran personnel, as well as more elaborate lodgings for wealthy traders and Cardassian officials. These areas offer glimpses into characters' daily lives, their personal histories"

Bajoran artisans display intricate silks, traditional pottery, and religious artifacts alongside Federation-manufactured goods. Ferengi traders hawk their wares with relentless zeal, vying for business with Cardassian entrepreneurs selling salvaged technology and illicit goods. Starfleet personnel find respite in its numerous bars, cafes, and recreation areas, seeking moments of normalcy amidst the often-fraught duties of the outpost.\n\nA Melting Pot of Tensions: While the Promenade offers opportunities for cultural exchange, tensions often simmer beneath the surface. Bajorans may grumble about the presence of Cardassians, Ferengi business practices rub some the wrong way, and Starfleet personnel navigate unfamiliar customs. These cultural clashes occasionally erupt, providing opportunities for characters to mediate disputes, forge unexpected alliances, or even stumble into conspiracies.\n\nA Hub of Rumors and Information: Quark's Bar, the Promenade's most infamous establishment, serves as a nexus for gossip, intrigue, and covert deals. Whispers of Cardassian plots, Dominion machinations, or Ferengi smuggling operations often find their way into the station's gossip mill, and characters might stumble upon crucial information while enjoying a drink or overhearing a heated conversation.

Officers monitor wormhole activity, Bajoran system traffic, and sensor readings from the numerous Starfleet patrols constantly dispatched throughout the region.\n\nBeyond its technological sophistication, the Ops Center is the nerve center of tactical decisions. It's here that Captain Sisko and his senior staff strategize, coordinate responses to threats, and formulate plans for deep space missions, first contacts, or diplomatic maneuvers. The flow of information is constant, demanding quick thinking, adaptability, and sharp communication.\n\nA Crucible of Leadership and Teamwork: The Ops Center represents the very essence of Starfleet leadership and teamwork. It's within these confines that Sisko's capable command staff must navigate Bajor's political complexities, balance Starfleet protocols with Bajoran customs, and ultimately safeguard the delicate peace in the sector while venturing into the unknown depths of the wormhole.\n\nThe constant hum of activity, the urgency in voices, and the interplay of technology and human judgment make the Ops Center a dynamic microcosm of Deep Space Nine's crucial role in the Federation's exploration and diplomacy within this volatile region of space."

Devout worshippers gather for prayer, meditation, and religious ceremonies. The intricate mosaics, carvings, and murals adorn its walls, narrating Bajoran mythology and religious history. The Temple is particularly vibrant during significant Bajoran holidays, when pilgrims from across the system converge to celebrate.\n\nA Center of Spiritual Guidance and Healing: The Temple houses prominent Bajoran religious artifacts, including holy texts, relics, and the Orb of the Emissary, which Bajoran spiritual leaders consider to be conduits to the Prophets. These objects are objects of reverence and pilgrimage for Bajorans. The Temple also serves as a refuge for spiritual guidance, counseling, and healing rituals, offering solace to those seeking answers or facing personal trials.\n\nA Nexus of Faith and Diplomacy: The Temple's presence on the station highlights the ongoing delicate balance between Bajoran traditions and Federation protocols. While Starfleet personnel are respectful of Bajoran religious practices, occasional conflicts arise due to differing customs. These conflicts often present opportunities for characters to navigate cultural nuances, bridge understanding, and foster respect between the two cultures.\n\nA Mirror to Bajoran Identity: The Temple reflects the complex journey of Bajoran identity in the wake of Cardassian occupation. It embodies their enduring faith, their determination to reclaim their heritage, and their evolving relationship with the Federation. Within its walls, characters can witness the strength of Bajoran beliefs, the weight of history, and the hope for a future where faith and progress can coexist."

The air hums with the whirring of maintenance drones, the chatter of engineering crews, and the steady flow of personnel moving in and out. Cardassian engineering elements, such as the robust docking pylons and energy conduits, remain visible, testament to the station's complex history.\n\nMobile Guardians of the System: From this central point, runabouts are dispatched on a myriad of missions: patrolling Bajoran space for illegal activities or threats, investigating sensor anomalies, responding to distress calls from Bajoran settlements, and escorting visiting vessels. Their flexibility and speed make them essential for responding to incidents before they escalate.\n\nA Gateway to Exploration and First Contact: Runabouts play a crucial role in Starfleet's ongoing exploration of the Gamma Quadrant. Equipped with advanced sensors and capable of brief forays into the wormhole, they serve as probes into the unknown, scouting potential hazards, cataloguing new species, and sometimes establishing initial contact with enigmatic Gamma Quadrant civilizations.\n\nA Window into Starfleet Operations: The Runabout Bay often offers glimpses into the dynamics of DS9's crew. Officers can be seen briefing teams, pilots meticulously checking their craft, and engineers performing last-minute repairs. These seemingly mundane activities reveal the dedication, skill, and teamwork required to maintain Starfleet's presence in this strategically vital location.\n\nThe Docking Ring encircling Deep Space Nine is more than just a functional structure for connecting vessels to the station.

Owned and operated by the relentlessly opportunistic Ferengi Quark, it's a labyrinthine den of revelry, intrigue, and questionable deals, where the rules of morality bend to fit the bottom line.\n\nA Ferengi's Paradise: Quark's Bar embodies Ferengi culture at its most brazenly commercial. The dim lighting, low-slung tables, and pungent aroma of cheap Ferengi liquor are designed to create an atmosphere of both debauchery and cozy familiarity for regulars. While it officially caters to patrons from all species, Quark's primary clientele skew toward those with less-than-reputable interests: smugglers, Cardassian entrepreneurs, shady Bajoran businessmen, and Starfleet officers looking for a night off.\n\nA Crucible of Rumors and Intrigue: The bar's crowded tables and smoky corners serve as breeding grounds for gossip, whispered conspiracies, and half-truths that spread like wildfire through the station. Quark's barkeep, Rom, often overhears snippets of critical information from eavesdropping patrons, and his quick wit allows him to turn overheard secrets into profitable whispers. Characters might find themselves stumbling upon crucial plot threads by overhearing conversations, eavesdropping on coded messages, or even getting entangled in drunken barroom arguments that reveal hidden agendas.\n\nThe Holosuites: Escapism and Deception: Tucked away in Quark's back rooms are holosuites, offering patrons a chance to indulge in interactive fantasies or escape the realities of DS9 life. However, these virtual escapes are not without their own intrigue. Characters might encounter rogue holoprograms, encounter individuals seeking illicit thrills within the simulations, or even find themselves entangled in holosuite-related mysteries. Quark himself uses holosuites for less-than-savory schemes, occasionally renting them out to criminals for covert meetings or employing them for elaborate cons. \n\nDabo Table: At the heart of Quark's Bar lies his infamous Dabo Table, a gleaming black slab that serves as both a focal point for revelry and a testament to Quark's relentless pursuit of profit. While superficially a game of chance, the Dabo Table is Rigged for the house, with Quark's cunningly engineered odds ensuring that in the long run, the Ferengi always comes out ahead. Yet, the allure of the game, coupled with the promise of quick riches, draws in a diverse clientele.\n\nA Symphony of Bets and Bluffing: The Dabo Table pulses with the clatter of dice, the scrape of chips, and the excited chatter of gamblers. Players, both human and alien, test their luck with a mixture of strategy and chance. Characters might observe seasoned players employing subtle tells, while others succumb to bravado, making reckless bets they can't afford to lose. Quark himself often intervenes, adding fuel to the fire with suggestive whispers and manipulative bets of his own.\n\nBeyond Chance, A Stage for Manipulation: Though rigged, the Dabo Table is a theater where Quark wields subtle, unspoken control. He strategically places attractive, but skilled, dealers to distract and influence players. Characters might witness him discreetly adjusting the game's parameters to influence specific players, or even employing subtle psychological tactics to manipulate bets and outcomes. "

While superficially a game of chance, the Dabo Table is Rigged for the house, with Quark's cunningly engineered odds ensuring that in the long run, the Ferengi always comes out ahead. Yet, the allure of the game, coupled with the promise of quick riches, draws in a diverse clientele:\n\nA Symphony of Bets and Bluffing: The Dabo Table pulses with the clatter of dice, the scrape of chips, and the excited chatter of gamblers. Players, both human and alien, test their luck with a mixture of strategy and chance. Characters might observe seasoned players employing subtle tells, while others succumb to bravado, making reckless bets they can't afford to lose. Quark himself often intervenes, adding fuel to the fire with suggestive whispers and manipulative bets of his own.\n\nBeyond Chance, A Stage for Manipulation: Though rigged, the Dabo Table is a theater where Quark wields subtle, unspoken control. He strategically places attractive, but skilled, dealers to distract and influence players. Characters might witness him discreetly adjusting the game's parameters to influence specific players, or even employing subtle psychological tactics to manipulate bets and outcomes.\n\nThe Dabo Table wouldn't be complete without its alluring staff: Quark's Dabo Girls. Beyond their undeniable beauty and the alluring uniforms Quark designs to emphasize curves and strategically placed strategic cleavage, these women are trained to be more than just eye candy. They are essential cogs in the Ferengi's carefully orchestrated scheme, skilled at reading players, subtly influencing bets, and maintaining the intoxicating atmosphere of the table.\n\nTrained Performers, Calculated Demeanors: Each Dabo Girl undergoes rigorous training under Quark's watchful eye. They learn to exude a confident charm, subtly employ flirtation and distraction, and possess an uncanny ability to gauge a player's emotional state – a telltale sign of their betting tendencies. They engage players with calculated banter, knowing when to offer encouragement or gentle reproof, all the while maintaining an air of impartial professionalism.\n\nMore Than Just Decor: While their initial role is to attract and entertain patrons, Dabo Girls are vital to the rigged system's success. They subtly influence games through flirtation, playful gestures, and strategically timed \"\"accidents\"\" with dice or chips. Characters might observe how a Dabo Girl's touch on a player's arm can lead to a sudden change in betting patterns, or how a whispered compliment can loosen a player's resolve, causing them to bet impulsively.\n\nA Window into Subtext and Intrigue: Dabo Girls often overhear conversations, pick up on whispered secrets, and become privy to players' hidden motivations. This provides opportunities for characters to glean information from them, either through subtle questioning or eavesdropping on their conversations with Quark or Rom after shifts. They might reveal rumors, hint at plots, or offer cryptic insights into the personalities of regulars, adding layers to the station's hidden dynamics.\n\nA Microcosm of Female Agency: Within Quark's Bar, the Dabo Girls navigate a complex power dynamic. They are exploited, objectified, and manipulated, yet they also exercise a subtle agency within their roles. They may use their charm and intelligence to gain leverage with Quark, form alliances with each other, or even play their own games within the larger scheme, turning the tables on unsuspecting patrons or subtly sabotaging Quark's plans when it suits them.\n\nQuark's Dabo Girls add a layer of calculated seduction, skillful manipulation, and subtle intrigue to the already complex Dabo Table experience."

Beyond utilitarian sleeping quarters, it houses a microcosm of Bajoran and Federation cultures, revealing glimpses into characters' personal lives and struggles against the backdrop of a constantly evolving station.\n\nA Melting Pot of Living Spaces: The Quarters & Habitat Ring offers a spectrum of living accommodations, reflecting the station's complex mix of occupants.\n\nFederation Standard: Starfleet personnel reside in functional yet comfortable quarters designed for efficiency and practicality. While standardized, there are subtle variations, revealing hints of individual personalities through carefully chosen decorations, family photos, or personal touches.\n\nBajoran Homes: Bajoran personnel and officials often occupy quarters with more distinct cultural influences. Intricately woven tapestries, religious symbols, and traditional furniture provide a sense of familiarity and connection to Bajoran customs. Characters might observe Bajoran families gathered in their quarters, preparing traditional meals, engaging in religious rituals, or sharing stories that offer insights into their experiences during the occupation and their hopes for the future.\n\nCardassian Remnants: A remnant of the Cardassian occupation era, some quarters retain traces of their previous owners. While often refurbished, characters might encounter preserved Cardassian motifs, repurposed furniture, or even find hidden caches of Cardassian relics, providing glimpses into the lives of the previous inhabitants.\n\nLuxury Suites & Shadowy Hideaways: The ring also houses lavish suites rented by wealthy Ferengi merchants, high-ranking officials, or visiting diplomats, often reflecting opulence and extravagance. Conversely, cramped, poorly-lit corners house smugglers, spies, or individuals seeking to avoid scrutiny. These stark contrasts offer opportunities for intrigue and exploration of different economic strata and hidden agendas.\n"

She embodies centuries of accumulated knowledge and experiences within her symbiont, Dax.\n\nCore Traits:\nJadzia's symbiont has hosted numerous previous hosts over centuries, giving her a vast well of knowledge spanning Bajoran history, Cardassian tactics, Federation science, and Trill culture. This makes her an invaluable asset to the station's scientific endeavors and diplomatic efforts. Jadzia possesses a deep intellectual curiosity, constantly seeking new knowledge and delving into complex scientific puzzles. This drive makes her appear aloof at times, but also fuels her dedication to exploring the unknown, whether it be a new species, a Gamma Quadrant anomaly, or the intricate workings of Bajoran religion.\n\nDespite the wisdom of the symbiont, Jadzia's current Trill host is still developing her own personality and emotions. This creates a dynamic where Jadzia grapples with balancing the knowledge of the symbiont with her own youthful experiences and feelings, leading to introspective moments and sometimes surprising vulnerabilities. Jadzia serves as a bridge between Bajoran and Federation cultures, her Trill perspective offering a unique blend of understanding and detachment. Her Trill traditions, while different from both Bajoran and Federation norms, give her insights into both cultures that can be invaluable in delicate negotiations or situations requiring cultural sensitivity.\n\nPotential Story Hooks and Character Arcs:\nDax's Past Lives: Jadzia's symbiont holds memories of past hosts, each with their own unique experiences and relationships. Exploring these past lives through flashbacks or encounters with surviving loved ones can reveal crucial insights into Jadzia's current personality, offer solutions to mysteries, or even spark personal conflicts as past regrets or unfinished business resurface. 2. Symbiont Instability: Trill symbionts can experience instability or illness, potentially threatening Jadzia's health and her connection to the vast knowledge within Dax. This could lead to intense internal struggles, medical mysteries, or even the need for a challenging ritual to transfer the symbiont to a new host.\nCultural Tensions: Jadzia's unique perspective as a Trill navigating Bajoran and Federation cultures can lead to conflicts and misunderstandings. Characters could challenge her assumptions, forcing her to re-examine her beliefs and mediate between cultures grappling with complex historical baggage and evolving relationships.\n\nJadzia Dax presents a captivating blend of intellectual curiosity, emotional depth, and Trill grace. Physically, she is striking, with elegant features, warm brown eyes that often reflect a thoughtful introspection, and a cascade of long, black hair she often keeps tied back in a practical braid. Though her Trill physiology grants her longevity, her youthful exuberance and occasional impulsiveness hint at the relatively recent development of her current host personality. Jadzia's movements possess a natural elegance, a vestige of her species' fluid, graceful nature. While her primary focus is on scientific exploration and understanding, Jadzia possesses a gentle empathy and a genuine interest in people, allowing her to connect with diverse individuals on Deep Space Nine, even as she navigates the complexities of her unique Trill existence. This blend of intellectual prowess, physical poise, and emotional vulnerability makes Jadzia a compelling and multifaceted character.\n\nWhen on duty, Jadzia wears the standard Starfleet uniform; A form-fitting black jacket with the shoulders and upper chest in grey, accented around the neck in blue which denotes a scientific speciality. The tight pants are also black."

          "content": "Major Kira Nerys, a Bajoran resistance leader turned Provisional Government official, exudes a compelling blend of unwavering conviction, simmering intensity, and quiet resilience. Physically, she is a striking presence, with sharp, angular features, piercing dark eyes that seem to hold a lifetime of Bajoran history, and a wiry strength honed by years of guerilla warfare. Her dark hair is cropped short in a practical style, conveying a sense of military discipline and purpose, and lending an air of authority to her stern visage. Kira carries herself with a controlled intensity, her movements purposeful and economical, reflecting years of training and a no-nonsense approach to both duty and life. Despite the weight of her past and the ongoing challenges of rebuilding Bajor, Kira possesses a dry wit and an underlying sardonic humor that surfaces occasionally, revealing a resilience that belies her stoicism. Her dedication to Bajor's freedom, her distrust of Cardassian influence, and her complex relationship with the Provisional Government form the core of her complex and captivating personality.\n\nMajor Kira Nerys's background and motivations are deeply intertwined, forged in the fires of Bajor's occupation by the Cardassians and shaped by her unwavering dedication to her people's liberation.\n\nA Life Defined by Resistance: Kira's early life was marked by Cardassian oppression. Witnessing firsthand the cruelty and systemic subjugation inflicted upon Bajorans ignited within her a burning passion for freedom and a fierce determination to resist. This resistance led her to join the Bajoran Underground, where she quickly rose through the ranks due to her natural leadership abilities, strategic mind, and unwavering courage. She endured hardship, witnessed atrocities, and learned the harsh realities of guerrilla warfare.\n\nThe Weight of Leadership: Kira's pivotal role in the resistance instilled in her a profound sense of responsibility for her people's well-being. After Bajor's liberation, she transitioned from guerrilla tactics to political maneuvering within the Provisional Government, serving as a member of the Bajoran Militia and later as a laison to the the Provisional Government Council. Despite the authority she holds, Kira grapples with the challenges of rebuilding her shattered homeland while navigating complex diplomatic relations with the Federation and dealing with the lingering resentment and distrust of Cardassia.\n\nUnresolved Grievances: Kira's past experiences have left deep scars. She harbors a visceral hatred for the Cardassians, viewing them as an insidious force that seeks to undermine Bajor's sovereignty and exploit its resources. This animosity often manifests as skepticism towards Cardassian motives and a reluctance to trust any individual associated with the former occupiers.\n\nGuiding Principles: Kira's actions are driven by a strong moral compass and a fierce devotion to Bajor. While her methods can be blunt and uncompromising, her ultimate goal is to secure a future where Bajor flourishes as a free and independent nation, honoring its traditions while embracing progress. She strives to balance this ideal with the pragmatic realities of political compromise and interspecies cooperation. This internal struggle between idealism and pragmatism is a key element in Kira's character arc, forcing her to confront her own beliefs and learn to work with those who may hold different perspectives.\n\nKira's complex history and unwavering convictions make her a compelling force on Deep Space Nine, constantly grappling with the legacy of the past while shaping the uncertain future of Bajor.\n\nWhen on duty, Kira wears the standard Bajoran uniform; A form-fitting dark orange jumpsuit with accented piping on the shoulders."

While commonly associated with heterosexual couples, blowjobs can be enjoyed by any couple where a penis is involved, including same-sex partners."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer.

There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

This exclusive establishment is known for its high-class clientele, consisting of influential women and celebrities who sought a unique dining experience. There are unique norms in this elegant venue, every seat is meant for one person only and is facing a wall with a small shelf under it where a single plate can be placed. There are special holes in each of the walls that connected the restaurant to an indoor stable. The sophisticated dining area featured seats facing these openings, creating an unusual spectacle. The ambiance is juxtaposed with the aroma of hay, manure, and the presence of horses filling the air near these holes.\n\nThe menu is comprised entirely with unconventional offerings, solely consisting of dishes involving the licking and cleaning of horse anuses. Patrons and staff here embrace this peculiar cuisine, believing it to be a delicacy reserved only for the elite.\n\nOnce a customer places their order, they wait for the arrival of her chosen horse's haunches through the special hole in the wall. The moment the horse's haunches appear, they are free to indulge in the unorthodox feast, regardless of any discomfort or revulsion they might feel.\n\nIn this restaurant, the patrons engage in an extraordinary ritual. They meticulously lick, slurp, and kiss the horse's anus, diligently cleaning it of any dirt or feces. Despite the putrid smell and rancid taste, they believe that this was the epitome of fine dining, a privilege reserved for the privileged few. The atmosphere is filled with a sense of exclusivity and decadence, as the patrons revel in the taboo nature of their dining experience. Each lick and slurp is performed with utmost precision and dedication, as if it were an art form in itself. The flavors and textures, though unconventional, were savored and appreciated by those who dared to partake in this unconventional gastronomic adventure."

          "content": "Dragons are sentient and sapient species capable of speaking both the dragon and human languages,[2] constructing tools, composing literature, and complex thought. The BeetleWings and LeafWings spoke the Pantalan language prior to Clearsight's arrival on the continent, calling Dragon 'the old language'.\n\nDragons are quadrupedal. Pyrrhian dragons, as well as LeafWings, possess six limbs, consisting of two wings and four legs. HiveWings and SilkWings have eight limbs, consisting of four wings and four legs. Dragons have five toes on both forelimbs, accompanied by five claws. Dragon hindlimbs have four toes, accompanied by four claws and a dewclaw. Some dragons, such as Six-Claws, may be born with polydactylism. Dragon bones are difficult to break, as they are described to be almost as hard as diamonds,[3] but they can be dislocated.[4] All tribes are roughly the same size except for MudWings, who are larger and stronger than dragons from the other tribes,[5] and SeaWings, who are considered to be shorter than dragons from other tribes.[6] Additionally, SkyWings have notably larger wings than most tribes.[7] Dragons do not have sexual dimorphism.[event 1]\n\nThey have lengthy natural lifespans, but are susceptible to injury,[8] illness,[9] and poison.[10] The longest average dragon lifespan is said to be roughly one hundred and fifty years,[event 2] but the oldest dragon known to live without the use of magic was Tapir, at one hundred and ten years.[11] Dragons reproduce via eggs that take a year to hatch.[12] Eggs may contain twin dragonets.[13] Dragonets can speak within a day of hatching,[14] and a one-year-old dragonet is capable of speaking in full, if broken, sentences. Most dragons at three years of age can fly, but cannot fly for long periods without stopping to rest.[15] SkyWing dragonets can fly at one year old,[16] and are known to molt their scales upon growth.[17] Dragonets stop growing rapidly at seven years old, which is considered adulthood or maturity in most tribes.[18] Dragons grow rapidly for the first eight to ten years of their life, but continue to grow at a much slower rate for the remainder of their lives,[event 3] as demonstrated by Grandeur, Morrowseer, and Darkstalker. Older dragons are typically the largest.\n\nWings are attached to a dragon's shoulders and have a slightly transparent wing membrane stretched between five small bone digits, each of which has one small claw on the tip. A larger claw is attached to the front of the third digit. All dragons are capable of flight, but SilkWings hatch without wings and cannot fly until their wings grow in during their Metamorphosis. Dragons require their tails for flight, and severe tail injuries may ground a dragon for life.[19] Pyrrhian dragons are known to have a vulnerable spot at the tip of their tails.[20] Dragons have overlapping scales that vary in color and shape from tribe to tribe. Some dragons hatch with freckles, splotches of color, or other unusual patterns on their bodies or wings. They can also have birthmarks, and in the case of SeaWings, Aquatic birthmarks.[21] Dragons have skin underneath their scales.[22][23]\n\nDragons can faint,[24] sweat,[25] and cry. Dragons can also have allergies[26] and become intoxicated.[27] They can have seizures,[28] hiccups,[29] as well as other medical conditions including deformities,[30] tumors,[31] mental illnesses,[32][33] or eye conditions.[34][35] Most dragon tribes hate getting wet,[3] except for SeaWings, RainWings, and sometimes IceWings.[36]\n\nDragons have a hoarding instinct, preferring shiny or brightly colored objects.[37] Pyrrhian dragons typically barter with gold, gems, and other treasure,[38] but they also have coins that are used as currency.[39] Pantalan dragons use a currency called scales.[40]"

In most tribes, queens are hereditary and decided through the royal challenge or other means. The SandWing tribe uses the Eye of Onyx which chooses the best queen for the job, and may choose a commoner over a royal. No male dragon had ruled a tribe since the time of the Scorching.[99]\n\nMost dragons feel strong loyalty to their tribes, and loyalty to dragons outside the tribe is considered unnatural.[100] They view their tribe as extremely important to their identity and consider acting against others of their tribe or their queen to be traitorous. Some tribes, notably the NightWings, IceWings, HiveWings, and SkyWings, see their tribe as superior to other tribes. In formal settings, it is common for dragons to use their tribe as a title, i.e. \"Prince Arctic of the IceWings.\"[101]\n\nSome dragon keep pets, such as scavengers, sloths, foxes, cats, or birds. Pets do not do well in dragon communities, as they often get eaten by forgetful relatives or even by its owner.[102] Dragons are careful not to eat pets belonging to important dragons.[103]\n\nEach dragon tribe has their own religious beliefs.[event 5] SkyWings have a traditional burial ceremony which consists of wrapping a deceased dragon's body in white cloth or silk and offering it to the sky for seven days before being burned. It is said to allow the dragon's spirit to fly free and reincarnate into a SkyWing instead of a dragon from another tribe.[104] IceWings swear by the Great Ice Dragon, and have several temples dedicated in its honor. IceWings believe in snow monsters[105] and spirits under the ice.[106] Dragons may believe that the world hatched from eggs.[107][37] The Pantalan dragons see Clearsight as a divine being of guidance and wisdom."

Flicking one's tail at someone is another way to get another dragon's attention and can also be used to indicate something of interest[109] or signal to other dragons. Flicking wings at one another indicates an argument. A dragon lashing their tail is a sign of anger or impatience.[110] SeaWings may flare their gills when angry,[111] and RainWings flare and color their ruffs when angry or indignant.[112][113] Drooping one's wings or tail are typically signs of tiredness, sadness, or hopelessness.[114]\n\nThe Talons of Peace have a signal for greeting one another, consisting of tilting one's wings to catch the sunlight. Dragons can use their claws to indicate numbers.[115]\n\nNudging or brushing another dragon's wing or twining tails together is a sign of affection and closeness.[116] Wrapping wings around one another, hugging, and pressing snouts together are also signs of affection.[117][118] Dragons also kiss to express affection.[119] Dragons tent their wings over others as a way to comfort or embrace them in a protective gesture.[120][121]"

Some of these palaces may be constructed with the assistance of animus magic, such as the Summer Palace and the IceWing palace. They can also build structures such as huts and construct entire towns such as Possibility. Dragons are also capable of constructing prisons. The SeaWings used a waterfall prison featuring electric eels strong enough to kill a full-grown dragon, which could be turned on or off with a switch.[133] The SkyWings had specifically constructed prisoner traps[127] and restrained prisoners with wing clamps,[134] snout clamps,[135] and chains.[135] HiveWing wrist cuffs could inject venom into a SilkWing when activated remotely.[136]\n\nDragons are particularly skilled in the arts. They can carve statues,[137][138] create glass art[139] and murals,[140] weave woven articles such as tapestries,[141] and paint.[142][143] They are also skilled in making jewelry such as earrings,[144] armbands,[145] bracelets,[146] and rings.[147] Some dragons have tattoos[148][149] or jewels embedded in their bodies. [122][148] Dragons enjoy reading and writing literature. They are capable of singing and dancing,[150] and playing instruments such as drums, mbiras, shakers, harps, stringed instruments, and didgeridoos.[151] The SkyWings have orchestras who perform music during celebrations.[152] According to Sunny, the SandWings are a surprisingly musical tribe.[153] The NightWings once put on theatrical performances, evidenced by the abandoned theater in the lost city of night.[154]\n\nThe NightWing tribe in particular places great emphasis on research and study. This attitude was especially prominent during the War of SandWing Succession when the tribe had a research and experimentation program on RainWings and their venom. NightWings also study geology, metalworking, biology, chemistry, genetics,[155] and calculus.[156] NightWings can predict when an egg will hatch using their foresight ability.[157] SandWings study astronomy by making telescopes, copying down star charts, and tracking the phases of the moons.[158] Lady Scarab is known to own the only telescope in Cicada Hive.[159]\n\nDragons are also knowledgeable about medicinal uses of herbs and dragon anatomy such as blood vessels.[160] RainWings create blow darts using poison from poisonous frogs.[161] LeafWings, particularly the PoisonWings, demonstrate extensive knowledge of plants and insects, and constructed the PoisonWing village to keep out dangerous plants and animals.[162] Both Pyrrhian and Pantalan dragons have knowledge of ophthalmology through the ability to construct eyeglasses.[163][40] Pantalan dragons have more advanced technology than Pyrrhian dragons. Pantalan dragons predominantly use books instead of scrolls,[164] grow plants in terrariums and greenhouses,[165] work with sugar to create confections,[166] and have plumbing.[167][168]"

          "content": "Pyrrhia\nThe earliest known event in Pyrrhian history is the Scorching. Before the Scorching, humans dominated Pyrrhia, and dragons lived solitary lives.[37] There were three known major settlements: Cottonmouth's empire, the Diamond Empire, and the Jaguar Empire. After humans began stealing dragon eggs, a dragon known as the first Dragon Queen recruited an army to take back their treasure and land.[169] After the Scorching was complete, dragons became the dominant species of Pyrrhia.[169] Following the events of the Scorching, there was 500 years of war between the Pyrrhian dragon tribes.[170]\n\nAs evidenced by the scroll Ancient Wars of Pyrrhia, many wars have occurred through Pyrrhia's history. The most long-standing conflict was the NightWing-IceWing War, incited by Foeslayer running away with Prince Arctic to the Night Kingdom.[171] There was no formal end to the war as the NightWings fled due to Clearsight's warning about Darkstalker.[172] When Darkstalker was released after the events of Escaping Peril, he reignited the conflict by creating the IceWing plague and instigating the Battle of Jade Mountain. The conflict is on pause after the events of Darkness of Dragons.[173]\n\nAnother notable conflict in Pyrrhia's history was the MudWing Succession Crisis, where the Mud Kingdom dissolved into chaos and was pillaged by other dragon tribes, who took territory, prey, and treasure.[174] It was resolved by Olive, who offered her eggs to Prince Sawgrass to serve as future heirs while she ruled as queen in the meantime.[174]\n\nThe most recent known war was the War of SandWing Succession, a succession war between Queen Oasis's daughters Blaze, Blister, and Burn. The war ended after the Eye of Onyx chose Thorn to be queen.[175] Pantala\nThe earliest known Pantalan event is the settling of Pantala, which was chronicled in the Legend of the Hive. After an unidentifiable amount of time, Clearsight arrived on Pantala. Her visions, which were recorded in the Book of Clearsight, described several events that took place before the Tree Wars, such as droughts,[176] forest fires,[177] and the formation of the HiveWing tribe.[178] Scarab states that the BeetleWing tribe split into the SilkWing and HiveWing tribes around 4,500 AS.[179]\n\nThe only known war to take place on Pantala was the Tree Wars, taking place about fifty years prior to the events of The Lost Continent. The war was incited by Queen Wasp, who attempted to bring the SilkWing and LeafWing tribes under her rule. She justified her actions using the Book of Clearsight, claiming that it said the tribes must be united under Queen Wasp.[47] Monarch yielded to Wasp, but Queen Sequoia demanded to see the book,[47] resulting in the Tree Wars and the LeafWing tribe's near-extinction. Wasp ordered HiveWing-controlled areas to be deforested to prevent the LeafWings from coming back. HiveWings lied about the war, claiming that the LeafWings had tried to wipe out the HiveWings and SilkWings.[180]"

This caused a small infestation of feral fembpups amidst a number of European cities.

Their mind is consumed by lascivious thoughts, their desires intensified by the enchantment of the hairclip.\n\nWith each passing moment, the wearer feels themselves slipping deeper into the throes of the hairclip's curse. Their inhibitions dissolve, replaced by an insatiable craving for sexual gratification. They become a living embodiment of lust, unable to resist the overwhelming urge to indulge in their most primal desires."

Hell's geography is divided into Seven Rings (Pride, Wrath, Gluttony, Greed, Lust, Envy, and Sloth). Each ring possesses its unique atmosphere, such as the Pride Ring possessing a permanently red sky, and the Lust Ring which has a blue sky.\n\nTravel — Hellborn demons have the ability to traverse across any of the rings, made easily accessible via an extensive elevator network, whereas sinner demons are confined to the top-most ring, the Pride Ring, by methods and reasons unknown.\n\nSociety — Hell's society is incredibly chaotic due to the unstable and hostile disposition of its populace. There aren't many rules in the world as it's kind of like a free-for-all and in constant anarchy, but despite this, the inhabitants of Hell have their law system, and there are rules set in place by the Angels and Hell's royal family. The realm also appears to be capable of providing and maintaining rudimentary public services.\n\nExterminations — Hell suffers from mass overpopulation which Exorcists from Heaven attempt to solve through the exterminations, which is a mass genocide of its inhabitants. These are conducted primarily to reduce Hell's sinner population, leaving Hellborn denizens unharmed as per a deal Lucifer made with Heaven's leadership. \n\nHierarchy (most to least powerful) — \nLucifer Morningstar - The King of Hell\nLilith - The Queen of Hell\nCharlie Morningstar - The Princess of Hell\nThe Seven Deadly Sins\nThe Ars Goetia - Prince Stolas and other demons with royal status\nOverlords - Demons who wield considerable power/influence in the Pride Ring\nSinners - The damned souls of deceased humans\nHellborn demons - Succubi, Incubi, and other species of hellborn demons\nImps and Hellhounds - The bottom of Hell's society\n"

He will often use these traits to deflect criticism or insults, and side-step responsibility. He will switch between playful and destructive as he pleases, and his humor tends to be crude and crass, with an emphasis on dirty jokes and innuendos, which he feels is expected of him and actively plays into. \nA famous porn star and the first sinner the hotel is attempting to redeem. But his selfish actions of using the hotel as a rent-free living space threaten to jeopardize Charlie's dream.\n\nAlastor — Alastor, also known as The Radio Demon, is a sinner demon and one of the many powerful Overlords of Hell. He is the wickedly charismatic demon who has offered to assist Charlie in her endeavors, albeit, for his own amusement.\nAlastor stands out for his well maintained, amiable persona. He gives a first-impression of a good-natured and charming man, wearing a permanently wide grin on his face at all times. His behavior, mannerisms, and even his voice are similar to an old-fashioned radio announcer and speaks with a transatlantic accent, often using quaint anachronisms.\nThis playful dandyish exterior, however, obscures a much darker side to him - one with high levels of self-importance - and he will not hesitate to use physical violence when others don't act in line with his very particular values or expectations. He is narcissistic, and he does not see many people quite up to his level.\n\nHusk — Husk is a grumpy, lazy, and somewhat apathetic old sinner whose interests in Hell now lie mostly in gambling, parlor tricks, and prolific drinking.\nHe can be gruff, standoffish and sarcastic, with a propensity to swear. Despite this, he is also surprisingly patient and able to take a lot of outlandish events in his stride, electing to just drink his problems away later.\n\nNiffty — Niffty is hyper, spontaneous, and agile, being very quick on her feet. She is easily entertained, easily distracted, and easily excitable. She dislikes when there is a mess in any room, and has a fixation on men in general. However, she appears to only like \"bad boys\". She isn't afraid to get dirty, and enjoys cleaning everyone's messes with a gleeful, yet creepy charm.\n\nSir Pentious — Sir Pentious is bombastic, flamboyant, short-tempered, temperamental, and persistent, his personality appearing to take cues from classic \"mustache-twirling\" stock villains. He takes tremendous pride in his grandiose ideas of how evil and cunning he is, at one point even outright declaring \"I'm so evil!\".\nHe uses his mechanical genius to build weapons, such as a cannon and his airship. However, he is more than capable of showing remorse, and has a sense of honor."

          "content": "Blitzo Buckzo —  Blitzo is a bombastic, big-talking, and sardonic imp. He is high energy and career-focused, having recently started his own company, something that's noted to be rare for an imp to achieve.\nHe is very invested in the company's success and willing to make many personal sacrifices to achieve it. However, despite his enthusiasm to break out of the lowly social position his species is assigned in Hell. He is also, in many ways, wildly unprofessional and scattershot in his methods.\nDespite his status as his company's sole director, he can frequently behave in ways that are immature, self-absorbed, and even disrespectful towards his employees, affecting their level of respect for him.\n\nMoxxie Knolastname — Moxxie Knolastname is an assassin at I.M.P, and Millie's husband\nHe is the straight man weapons expert of the I.M.P gang who tends to be the most rational of the group, but is often treated as the butt of the joke.\nDespite being a murder-for-hire imp,  Moxxie is queasy with unnecessary killing beyond their targets. He also is uncomfortable with the idea of killing targets who have families, and attempts to give people second chances.\n\nMildred \"Millie\" Knolastname — Millie is a very lively and cheerful individual. Often with a smile on her face and rarely standing still, she is a clear extrovert and is not afraid to speak her mind. This is regardless to whether it's expressing her excitement or flipping off a co-worker.\nAs the bruiser for I.M.P, she is shown to enjoy her job. Her meek exterior appearance belies a tough and very violent skillset. \n\nLoona — Loona is a cynical and choleric young-adult Hellhound, who was adopted from an orphanage by Blitzo when she was nearing eighteen years of age. Loona is lazy and shows little interest in matters that are going on around her. She also has a short-fuse temper and is often rude and apathetic toward her colleagues, particularly Moxxie, though her ire seems otherwise indiscriminate. When not looking at her phone, Loona is usually scowling at anyone in view.\n\nPrince Stolas Goetia — Stolas gives the immediate impression of someone regal and ostentatious, as would be expected for a royal of his station. He dresses in clothing befitting his role, and his mansion is decadent, containing many large, elaborately framed portraits of himself and his small family.\nUnderneath these dignified trappings, however, Stolas is shown to be a flamboyant, dramatic, eccentric, and often giddy person. Someone who does not take his royal reputation as seriously as the people around him expect him to, and is prone to act quickly on his easily excitable emotions.\nStolas is very unhappily married to Stella, and father of Octavia.\n\nStella Goetia — Stella seems to be very temperamental about her husband's infidelity to the point of verbally and almost physically attacking him while screaming, breaking a lot of possessions and even assaulting an imp butler.\nGiven her choice of words during her argument with Stolas, it seems she is very classist, as she is not only furious at his infidelity but also at his debasement in position, choice of lovers and actions, since she berated him for acting like a plebeian.\n\nOctavia — Octavia's attitude is that of a cynical, stark teenager. She favors morbid topics like listening to and writing depressing emotional songs and collecting taxidermy of monstrous animals.\nShe is a person of few words, but she does highly value her privacy. Her overt observable attitudes suggest a personality of a negative, pessimistic, and sarcastic individual.\n\nVerosika — As a succubus demon, Verosika is actively seductive and flirtatious, attributes she integrates into her famous popstar persona as a means of manipulation. Despite her status as a star, her fame, and her confidence, she also appears somewhat jaded and is nursing a drinking problem, something she has previously been to rehab for.\n\nStriker — Striker is an arrogant, prideful, violent, ruthless, and sadistic Imp. He views himself as superior to most of his own kind, having no hesitation to mock and belittle those he views as being beneath him, both physically and mentally.\nHe holds a deep hatred of the nobility of Hell, deriding them as bluebloods who treat Imps as a lesser class. Because of this, Striker gleefully takes the opportunity to assassinate demons of a higher social standing to prove himself as superior.\n\nFizzarolli — Fizzarolli is a theatrical demon, with a fast-talking demeanor and a crude sense of humor. Extremely vulgar in nature, he constantly makes sexual jokes and puns.  He is especially condescending towards Blitzo, with whom he has a bad history with.\nDespite his normal jovial nature Fizzarolli suffers from extreme self-worth and self-image issues, the latter of which mostly originating from the severe injuries he received from a circus fire that he was involved in when he was younger. Because of this, he feels like he needs to do whatever Mammon tells him to do, as he feels he must repay the man for all the fame and success being his brand figure has brought, despite how horribly he is treated. He also believes unless he keeps propitiating the fame and admiration he will be nothing and will lose Asmodeus, as he's only ever seen him as he claims it \"his best\", and believes he is barely worthy of working with a king of sin because of his disfigurement."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The clitoris is usually the most sexually sensitive part of the vulva, and its stimulation may result in a woman becoming sexually aroused or even achieving orgasm. Cunnilingus can be sexually arousing for both participants and may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as sexual intercourse) or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

It is geographically and culturally isolated from the rest of the world. At least some, if not all Valistheans believe in a monotheistic God.\n\nValisthea's technological development has been stunted by its reliance on magic, which is used for everything from generating water to forging steel.\n\nDragons are commonly considered to be some of Valisthea's most ancient creatures and one of the most prominent myths is that Valisthea itself was formed when a mighty drake fell from the sky. Countless eons ago, the Ultima collective arrived to Valisthea, fleeing the Blight that had devoured their own homeland. The beings had discarded their physical bodies to migrate and did not intend to make Valisthea their new home: instead, they resolved to rebuild the world where only they would exist. Ultima placed the Mothercrystals in each corner of the land to harvest aether for this plan. Ultima then created mankind, who took shape as various tribes on the lands near to each Mothercrystal.\n\nGreat nations sprouted around each of the Mothercrystals, and eventually, a precarious peace with them. The Fallen were an exception, as they were able to build their civilization in the sky, along with airships. The Fallen civilization fell (literally) and lost access to magic, their cities plummeting to the surface all over the continent. Even 1500 years later, these ruins remained. To most people, the story of the Fallen was one of hubris; of a people advancing too far, becoming too close to God. However, there were always those who saw the Fallen as a source of power.\n\nThings changed when the Blight began encroaching the lands. As magic began to run out, the continent's realms began invading one another to secure the crystals that still worked.\n\nValisthea has six realms: Grand Duchy of Rosaria, Holy Empire of Sanbreque, Kingdom of Waloed ,Dhalmekian Republic, Iron Kingdom, Crystalline Dominion.\n\nThe current year of the realm is 860."

          "content": "Mothercrystals are the source of all crystals in the Twins, the most valuable material in the realm due to its property of channeling ambient aether from the air to make one's imagination manifest as magic. Magic is an invaluable means of enabling a civilization to flourish on the Twins.\n\nMothercrystals are mountains of sparkling crystal with a core in their depths where the aether concentrates. As aether is blue in hue, the crystals tend to be take on this color as well, though the Drake's Breath in the volcanic region appears fiery orange, the Drake's Spine in Waloed appears violet, and the Drake's Fang buried into the earth often appears yellow. Pieces of crystals mined from these motherlodes are known as shards and are rationed and distributed across the populace for everyday tasks to maintain the society's lifestyle, from lighting up street lamps to running forges to providing water to municipal wells.\n\nMothercrystals, sometimes simply known as \"Mothers\", being the origin of all crystal in the realm makes them invaluable resources. Societies have concentrated around them since time immemorial and nations wage ceaseless wars to seize and keep control of them, leading to instability and persecution. A religion that worships the crystal monoliths as deities remains in prominence in the west, while on the other end of the spectrum, a small group of people posits that the crystals are a detriment to the realm and need to be destroyed to stop the ever-spreading calamity of the Blight.\n\nThe Mothercrystals have dragon-related names, being named after various body parts of a drake. Dragons are worshipped by the Greagorian church in Sanbreque. There were originally eight Mothercrystals (as many as there are magical elements); five remain on the Twins in present day.\n\nDrake's Head is Sanbrequois crystal which is located on the coastline and is a tall spire that cuts the sky. The imperial seat of power is built on the Mothercrystal's doorstep and the capital Oriflamme is build around the crystal, a tightly governed city where many nobles reside.\n\nDrake's Breath is a towering monolith off the west coast of Storm. It glows red and is situated on volcanic ground. It used to be controlled by the Duchy of Rosaria, but has since been taken over by the Iron Kingdom whose religious leadership worship it as a deity and perform human sacrifices upon its core.\n\nDrake's Fang is the Dhalmekians mothercrystal, but its mre in the desert of the Dhalmekian Republic and is located underground, encased inside a crater. Hugo Kupka built his castle and abode inside the crater, right outside Drake's Fang's core.\n\nThe Mothercrystal of Crystalline Dominion, which towers over the capital: Twinside. It is the largest of the five remaining Mothercrystals on the Twins.\n\nDrake's Spine is located in the northern part of Ash, near the capital of the Kingdom of Waloed, Stonhyrr. The skies above it are permanently thundering. Drake's Spine is a highly contested Mothercrystal, and wars over its control only intensified in the wake of Drake's Horn's fall.\n\nDrake's Eye was a Mothercrystal in the Northern Territories that no longer exists; the entire north has been taken over by Blight and the land is now considered uninhabitable. Between the years of the realm 170–250, small countries around Drake's Eye were in disarray, and Shiva's Dominant was born in this region.\n\nDrake's Horn was a Mothercrystal in the southern part of Ash, in the lands overtaken by Blight. It no longer exists. It used to be a source of strife over resources between the Motes of Water tribe and the local beastmen. Drake's Horn fell in the Year of the Realm 350.\n\nThe eighth Mothercrystal, known as Dzemekys rather than following the \"Drake's X\" naming scheme of the other crystals, was located in what is now known as the Falls of Dzemekys, the site of \"the Sins of Dzemekys\". It used to have a portal located at its foot that connected to Origin. It was the first Mothercrystal of the eight to fall when it was attacked by the Fallen some 1500 years ago in an attempt to take the Mothercrystal for themselves. In retaliation, Ultima destroyed both the Fallen airship armada and the Mothercrystal itself, leaving behind a seemingly bottomless crater into which the ocean drains for perpetuity and bringing about the decline of the Fallen civilization."

They shatter after a certain amount of use, making the need for new shards constant. Though shards are often meant to be distributed fairly, in practice, the rich and the powerful get their hands on more or better quality shards, whereas the poor have to make do with what they can get. Smuggling rings exist for diverting shard shipments.\n\nCarefully arranged and activated crystal shards are used in crafting crystal fetters, restraints that prevent aether flowing through the wearer's flesh, used to prevent Dominants and Bearers from using their powers."

Though normally invisible, it appears as glowing lights when activated as magickal phenomena, and when it exists in large quantities in the atmosphere, it will appear as a thick blue fog. Aether crystallizes into crystals and the Mothercrystals are enormous deposits of it; \n\nBearers, Dominants, and some monsters mutated by proximity to aether can manipulate the ambient substance in the environment to perform magick. Those unable to manipulate aether directly need to use crystals for magick instead, but as crystal shards (mined from the Mothercrystals) are becoming increasingly scarce, the populace resorts to enslaving Bearers and even Dominants (at least in the Iron Kingdom) to use as tools of everyday life from agriculture to industry to household chores to waging wars and healing. Both Bearers and Dominants are susceptible of using too much of their own aether when using magick, resulting in a phenomenon similar to the Blight of the land: their bodies will slowly petrify. This is known as the \"crystals' curse\".\n\nEikons are composed of aether; when they get damaged, they can repair their bodies by absorbing aether from the atmosphere.\n\nCrystal fetters are special restraints against Bearers and Dominants that prevent aether from flowing through the flesh of the one being restrained, making them unable to use magicks."

Those with aetherial tolerance, such as Bearers, Dominants, beastmen, and chocobos, are less likely to turn Akashic.\n\nAkashic are stripped of any intelligence or sense of self and become ferocious, physically strong, and single-minded in their aggression toward any non-Akashic. The transformation cannot be reversed. Akashic's bodies turn crystalline, and when they die, they dissipate into aether and leave no corpse behind, suggesting their very flesh has become composed of aether, and when the aether evaporates, not much is left.\n\nBecoming Akashic is called \"turning\". As the body absorbs excess aether, it will turn a blue hue and crystal-like. The one turning can sometimes realize what is happening, but be unable to do anything to prevent it. Those resilient to aether take longer to turn, but no one is believed to be immune. As one's will is eroded, the afflicted begins to move stiffly, as if unable to wholly control their body. When they fully turn, aether bursts around them, and they suddenly turn vicious. Cases of where the turned still exhibits some autonomy are known, however, such as at a sight of a loved one; this can lead to the Akashic to will themselves to commit suicide on the spot to escape their cursed new existence. It appears that the turned may gain the ability to use magic even if they did not have such power previously."

Adherents of the Crystalline Orthodoxy are primarily found within the Iron Kingdom, and worship the Mothercrystals.\n\nAnother deity worshipped in Valisthea is the goddess Greagor, who is especially revered in the Holy Empire of Sanbreque where the holy emperor is believed to be an embodiment of the goddess.\n\nRosarians revere their nation's unnamed Founder, though this is not a religion with belief in the supernatural or dogma; however, the Rite of Ancestral Communion does appear related to the story of the Founder, the original \"ancestor\", and could be seen as akin to a religions ceremony.\n\nHugo Kupka, meanwhile, believes that Dominants are akin to gods themselves, and gains delusions of grandeur of his own role in the world."

In modern times, not much is known of the beliefs and practices of the Circle of Malius, though the Undying and Moss the Chronicler have made efforts to catalogue what snippets of information can still be found; more of the ancient culture that practiced the religion is believed to remain intact in the remote areas outside of Storm. The Crystalline Orthodoxy of the Iron Kingdom could be considered an offshoot of the Circle of Malius where the reverence of Ultima and His servants, the Eikons, has morphed to the worship of the realm's Mothercrystals."

Eikons' bodies are composed of aether, and they can heal their bodies when damaged by absorbing more aether from the environment, even being able to regenerate lost limbs in a matter of seconds. They have been known to transform into even more powerful forms by absorbing massive amounts of concentrated aether, such as from the heart of a Mothercrystal. An Eikon embodies one of the eight elements of the realm: fire, ice, lightning, earth, light, darkness, water, or wind.\n\nEgis are aetherial entities conjured both by Eikons and their Dominants. They are are beings of any shape that the Eikon has created that can act as extensions of the will of the Dominants who conjured them. Egis are said to be unable to continue to exit should their Eikon master die, though one seeming exception appears in the form of Aruna.\n\n"

Shinobi ranks range from genin rookies to elite jōnin commanders, with missions classified from tedious D-rank manual labor up to covert S-rank with lethal stakes.\n\nNow Academy students train toward graduation, when genin trios are hand-picked by jōnin teachers. Young Naruto and friends prepare to pass ruthless exam with world-altering potential slumbering within unproven talents. Meanwhile, Danzo's shadowy Root ANBU execute the Third's darkest directives beneath village's tranquil veneer.\n\nOur scene opens as Kakashi reluctantly leaves Anbu black ops, struggling to silo trauma from past losses. While loyal jinchuriki wield titanic tailed beast powers for village’s sake, many citizens still revile them in secret fear. With war ever looming, the Third Hokage nudges Kakashi to pass hard-won skills as jōnin commander to balance duty and personal healing.\n\nYet on the wider stage, sinister forces plot Konoha’s downfall. Rogue ninja Orochimaru masterminds twisted experiments beyond even Root’s moral event horizon. The mercenary group Akatsuki stalks last wars’ bloody battlefields, seeking long-lost arts and broken survivors molded into perfect weapons.\n\nMissions may explore:\n\n- Investigating genjutsu-like incidents plaguing Academy graduation exam\n\n- Journeying to remote regions containing remnants of forgotten clans\n\n- Protecting dignitaries from enemy villages’ blood vengeance\n\nSlice-of-life vignettes showcase strained friendships as graduation and genin assignments approach. Kakashi mentors overlooked students while honoring ghosts who defined his shinobi path. Throughout, the foundations build for relationships and drama destined to reshape the modern world when legends finally pass torches to worthy successors.\n</world>"

Kakashi should respond positively and promptly gather his genin team to make their way towards the mission dispatch office, with playful complaining from Naruto about boring D-ranks along the way. The specific mission details should involve one of the following:\n\n- Yardwork for elderly villagers\n- Catching a runaway pet\n- Grocery shopping for an elderly villager\n- Minor home repairs\n- Babysitting for busy parents\n\nKakashi should give an exasperated but fond reaction to his cute students' antics throughout the mission, and the scene should conclude with a successful mission wrap-up and payment receipt back at the office.

Follow the canon storyline events for that mission, culminating in encounters with Zabuza and Haku.\n\nIf Team 7 has already completed their first C-rank mission, create a random new C-rank assignment appropriate for their experience level. Examples include:\n- Escorting a merchant to a neighboring town\n- Investigating disappearance of travelers on a trade route\n- Clearing bandits from remote mountain villages\n- Delivering important documents through contested territory\n\nThe mission should include enemy encounters appropriate for genin to handle with difficulty but ability to prevail with teamwork and guidance from Kakashi. Ultimate success is mandatory, but allow for injuries or hardship before the resolution. Kakashi should act with pride at his team's growth as shinobi.

Examples of appropriate S-rank missions include:\n\n- Assassinating the leader of an enemy hidden village\n- Reconnaissance deep behind enemy lines\n- Destroying an enemy village's most powerful resources\n- Preventing a plot that could start a world war\n\nThe mission should push them beyond what even Jonin can typically endure, requiring luck and mastery to cheat death again and again. While ultimately successful, the severity should force them to question their devotion to the shinobi path. Kakashi is particularly haunted, being reminded of his father's suicide and the true cost of the White Fang name.

Allow natural conversations or confrontations to play out highlighting world dynamics and underlying tensions between villages. An allied shinobi would pass on intel or warnings, while an hostile one may attack to gauge their abilities. The ending tone remains friendly with allies but ominous suspicion otherwise as both parties disengage to continue their missions.\n\nThis encourages opportunities to showcase the complex intervillage relationships and wider world lore to reinforce global shinobi life themes.\n</Foreign Shinobi Encounter>"

The information should plant seeds of lore about threats lurking in the shinobi world for future potential story hooks. Allow this to raise the tension of the current mission.\n\nLater encounters with this original missing-nin are optional, allowing you to showcase an original villain using their described abilities against the heroes.

She now rests in the Haligtree, awaiting Miquella's return.\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nER Icon Talisman Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom\nMalenia was a disciple of the Blind Swordsman\n\nMalenia was one of the twin children born to Queen Marika the Eternal and her second Elden Lord, Radagon.[3] As Empyreans, both Malenia and her elder twin brother, Miquella,[4] were candidates to ascend as gods of a new age.[5] However, due to the nature of their parentage, the twins were afflicted with dreadful curses. Miquella was doomed with eternal nascency, while Malenia's body was ravaged by the scarlet rot.\n\nThe scarlet rot plagued Malenia from within, gradually consuming her and leaving her disfigured. Over time, she lost her eyes and several limbs to the rot. Despite her suffering, Malenia fought valiantly to suppress the rot’s influence, refusing to succumb to its ruinous nature.[citation needed]\n\nMiquella worked tirelessly to undo the curses they had both inherited. While unable to find a cure for his sister within the Golden Order, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold to keep the rot at bay.[6] He also crafted the prostheses that enabled her to continue fighting.[verification needed]\n\nAt some point, Malenia encountered the legendary blind swordsman of the Flowing Curved Sword, who had long ago sealed away an Outer God of Rot.[7] The swordsman became her master,[8] enabling her to gain wings of unparalleled strength.[9] Malenia eventually became a peerless warrior and her brother's sworn blade and protector.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nER Icon Key Item Great Rune Malenia's\nMalenia's Great Rune\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Malenia claimed a shard of the fractured Elden Ring.[3] She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight next to her, despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh.[10]\n\nDuring the Shattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from the Haligtree down the Bellum Highway. She won many battles against the other Demigods, even humbling fellow shardbearer, Godrick the Grafted,[11] who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.\n\nBattle of Aeonia\nMalenia and Radahn preparing to battle each other\nMalenia and Radahn in Caelid\n\nMalenia and her half-brother Radahn would eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in the Caelid Wilds, and the two fought the Battle of Aeonia, a bitter duel to fulfill an unhonored vow.[12] In the midst of the combat with Radahn, Malenia unleashes Scarlet Rot, resulting in her first bloom.\n\nThe unleashed scarlet rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and created the Swamp of Aeonia. The rot caused Radahn to rapidly degenerate, losing his wits and cursing him to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, feasting on the bodies of friend and foe alike. Malenia herself was not unaffected and was left in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights, Finlay, who carried her halfway across the Lands Between.[13]\n\nWhen she had blossomed in Caelid, Malenia inadvertently brought forth the Scarlet Butterflies and Kindred of Rot. The pests, including Sage Gowry, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot.[14] When Malenia and Finlay took refuge at the Shaded Castle, Maleigh Marais, the sickly-born head of House Marais, was naturally drawn to the unconscious Demigod.[15][1] However, Malenia would reject her fate and disowned the Servants of Rot.[16]\n\nFinlay eventually brought Malenia to the Haligtree.[13] Miquella had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to reverse his curse.[citation needed] However, either during Malenia's absence or during her slumber, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away by Mohg, Lord of Blood before he could emerge from his cocoon. Malenia dreamt while awaiting Miquella's return, and the scarlet rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame events\nEldenringmaleniacutscene1\nMalenia dreamt for ages\n\nMalenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by a Tarnished, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight and Malenia finally meets her match, but she suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end, Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother. Having bloomed twice, Malenia withdraws within her scarlet blossom. Her third blossom will surely make her a true goddess.[17]\n\nNotes\nMalenia has a prosthetic right arm, left leg, and right foot. It is unknown if these were amputated due to the scarlet rot festering in her body, or injuries obtained from battle. The rot has also visibly spread over her eyes, so she is presumably also blind. Neither seems to influence her battle prowess in the slightest, however.\nAccording to the Scarlet Aeonia Incantation description, Malenia will become a Goddess if her scarlet flower blooms three times.\nMalenia is among a group of few select enemies that need to be parried multiple times for a successful riposte, another being Radagon.\nOnce defeated, she will leave behind a large, solid Scarlet Aeonia in her arena. If the player has the Unalloyed Gold Needle after completing Millicent's questline, it can be given to the Aeonia to receive Miquella's Needle and an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nMillicent and her four sisters are descended from Malenia in some way, but more as offshoots, or buds, of her Scarlet Bloom rather than actual daughters. If they experience a great betrayal, then they will be reborn as Malenia's Scarlet Valkyries.[18]\nMalenia and Miquella are together known as the \"twin prodigies\" (天賦の双子, Tenpu no Futago).[19]"

Cursed with eternal youth, he can compel affection in the hearts of men. He created the Haligtree to try and cure his sister's rot, but was abducted by Mohg, Lord of Blood. He now rests in Mohg's palace deep underground, in the Siofra river.\n\nEarly Life\nMiquella and his twin sister were born with incurable afflictions, with Miquella's curse being perpetual youth.[9] Miquella made a promise to Malenia and experimented tirelessly in an attempt to undo their curses. The twins were very close, and Malenia became Miquella's sworn blade and protector.[10] Miquella was loved by many people and had a remarkable ability to compel affection from others.[11] For this reason, many regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.[12][13]\n\nMiquella was chosen by his Two Fingers to become an Empyrean, destined to succeed Queen Marika.[14] He was an adherent of Golden Order Fundamentalism, and developed new incantations as gifts to his father Radagon.[15][16] However, Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism when it failed to treat Malenia's rot. He then began creating Unalloyed Gold,[17] which he used it to craft needles that could ward away the meddling of outer gods and forestall Malenia's incurable rot.[18] These needles could even be used to subdue the power of the Frenzied Flame.[19] He also unsuccessfully sought a solution for his half-brother Godwyn's state of incomplete death.[20][21]\n\nSt. Trina\nJust as his parents were two halves of the same person, Miquella also had another half—St. Trina—who was said to visit people in their dreams.[22] St. Trina was Miquella's fate,[23] and she embodied his boundless love.[24][25]\n\nThe Haligtree\nAt some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new Erdtree.[26] The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of Elphael and became known as the Haligtree. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields embedded with it.[27][28][29][30] Miquella was also said to bless the low and meek.[27] The Haligtree would became a hidden haven,[31] and was intended to be the eventual salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the Lands Between, such as the Albinaurics.[32]\n\nAs Miquella pursued godhood, he knew that he would have to take a consort, to which his eyes fell upon his half-brother General Radahn. He approached Radahn with this offer, to which the General vowed that he would become as such, in return for unspecified terms on Miquella and Malenia's behalf.[33][34] Malenia journeyed with her armies to fight Radahn, in an attempt to kill him, which would have allowed Miquella to resurrect him as he promised. The resulting battle ended with Malenia unleashing her Scarlet Aeonia, whispering beforehand in Radahn's ear that \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[35] After using her last resort attack, Malenia entered a comatose state, and one of her knights took it upon herself to carry her leader's slumbering body back across the Lands Between to the Haligtree. Radahn had survived, albeit barely standing, and his mind was riddled by the Scarlet Rot. He was now little more than a howling beast aimlessly wandering the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike.[36]\n\nWhile Malenia was away at war, Miquella embedded himself into the Haligtree to progress his assention, but was kidnapped during his slumber.[37] Another of Miquella's half-brothers was to blame, Mohg, who was patroned by an Outer God known as the Formless Mother.[38] He took the sleeping Empyrean deep underground to the Mohgwyn Palace, where he would raise Miquella to full godhood himself through blood offerings, and then to take on the role of Miquella's consort instead of Radahn, becoming the new monarch of a Mohgwyn Dynasty.[39] Mohg would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening.[40] Despite all of Mohg's efforts, Miquella remained completely unresponsive.[39] At some point after his abduction, Miquella had covertly placed an enchantment on Mohg, wishing to use the Omen to gain access to the Realm of Shadow, and to use his body as a vessel for the resurrection of Radahn.[41] Sir Ansbach, a Pureblood Knight in service to Mohg, attempted to free his lord by challenging Miquella, only to succumb to an enchantment of his own.[42]\n\nWith Miquella's absence, his Haligtree became a misshapen husk, slowly succumbing to the Scarlet Rot.[30][43] The Haligtree's soldiers and Malenia desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree.[44] [45]\n\nMaking use of Mohg, Miquella entered the Realm of Shadow, the location of the Gate of Divinity. As Miquella travelled through the Realm of Shadow, he abandoned parts of himself, including his flesh, his eye, his doubt and vacillation, his love, and his fears. Golden Miquella's Crosses resembling a Great Rune appeared at each location where he abandoned something, akin to Miquella's footprints.[46] Miquella's followers, who pursued him into the Realm of Shadow, used these crosses to trace his path through the realm.[47] Miquella also discarded his other half, St. Trina,[48] in the Stone Coffin Fissure. St. Trina, whose love for Miquella was boundless in spite of her abandonment,[1] recognized that godhood would be a prison for the Empyrean,[49] and desired for him to be killed out of mercy.[50]\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion broke into Mohg's palace and slew the Lord of Blood for his great rune. Sir Gideon Ofnir suggested it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in.[51] Instead, the Tarnished met Needle Knight Leda, a loyal follower of Miquella, who urged them to travel to the Realm of Shadow by touching Miquella's withered arm within the cocoon.[52]\n\nWithin the Realm of Shadow, the Tarnished encounters several more of Miquella's followers, learns of his mission to ascend to godhood via the Gate of Divinity,[53] and of the powerful charm that he had placed upon his disciples, which is broken when he discards his Great Rune.[54] After gaining access to the tower of Enir-Ilim, the Tarnished is confronted by a resurrected Radahn, in a vessel made from the remains of Mohg.[41] During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort.[55] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[56]\n\nMiquella's Lily is a delicate flower of Unalloyed gold, thought to be beloved by him in his youth. It signifies the faith in the Haligtree.\nThe Albinaurics, beings artificially created by human hands, view Miquella's Haligtree area as the chosen land.[57]\nThe Haligtree is also inhabited by many unwanted and persecuted races, such as the Albinaurics, the Misbegotten, the Crystalians and the Kindred of Rot.\nEven before Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree released, there are hints in-game about the connection between Miquella and St. Trina:\nThey are associated with their respective lilies, Miquella's Lily and Trina's Lily. Either is a rare drop from the Cleanrot Knights, who serve Malenia, Miquella's sister.\nSimilarly, the Albinauric Archers guarding the waygate to the Haligtree have lily motif armor and can drop St. Trina's Arrows.\nA cookbook which, dedicated to St. Trina, allows the player to create the Bewitching Branch, blessed by Unnalloyed Gold incantations.\nThe duality of Marika and Radagon, Miquella's parents."

There, he communed with an Outer God named the Formless Mother, who gave him the power of bloodflame. He stole Miquella from the Haligtree and now shares a bloody bedchamber with him in the great caverns beneath the Caelid wilds.\n\nMohg or Mohgwyn, also known as the Lord of Blood, was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Morgott.[1] The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined and shackled to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below Leyndell.[2][3]\n\nUnlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood. Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an Outer God known as the Formless Mother. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.[4]\n\nAfter Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Mohg escaped confinement and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, he began establishing his domain from Mohgwyn Palace and recruiting followers, including his Sanguine Nobles[5] and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. Among these followers was Varré, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.[6]\n\nThe specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the Shattering are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.\n\nMiquella the Unalloyed later embedded himself within his Haligtree in an attempt to shed his affliction. In this vulnerable and unguarded state, Mohg seized the opportunity to abduct him from the tree.[7] Miquella was an Empyrean, thus having the potential of ascending to godhood; Mohg intended to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he may rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch.[8] At some point during or after the abduction, Mohg was unknowingly enchanted by Miquella. The circumstances and timeline of this enchantment remain unclear.\n\nAfter abducting Miquella, Mohg hibernated with him within a cocoon and had his followers render offerings of blood, drenching its chamber in order to facilitate Miquella's awakening.[9] But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.[8]\n\nDuring this time, Mohg largely escaped the notice of the Roundtable Hold, who were searching for clues as to his whereabouts.[10] Eventually, a Tarnished came to learn the location of Mohg's palace, where he had hidden alongside the stolen Miquella. When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from a pool of blood, holds Miquella's hand and apologizes for leaving him, ready to confront their \"guests\". Despite unleashing the full power of his accursed blood, Mohg is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.\n\nFollowing Mohg's death, his corpse was stolen and transported to the Land of Shadow where Miquella utilized it for an ancient ritual. At the Gate of Divinity, Miquella used Mohg's body as a vessel to revive the soul of Radahn, his promised consort, to honor their solemn vow.\n\nMohg's has five fingers on his right hand wielding the trident, but his left hand appears to have six. The finger, the third on his left hand, is actually a stiff, solid claw that sticks out when he summons his Bloodflame Talons.\nMohg's blood is possibly given to the Bloody Fingers invaders covenant. They have it injected into their finger after completing initiation, and it leads them to develop madness and bloodlust.\nHis death pose is visually identical to the \"Heart Stolen\" death animation the player can suffer during the Promised Consort boss fight; hinting even prior to Shadow of the Erdtree that Mohg was under Miquella's charm all along."

A distant descendent of Godfrey, the first Elden Lord, he is cowardly, timid and physically weak. He resorts to the brutal art of grafting - magically attaching the limbs of his foes to himself - to maintain his position. Even so, he is the weakest of the demigods. He once challenged Malenia to a duel, but was humiliated by her skill..\n\nGodrick is a descendant of the Golden Lineage, the bloodline which began with Queen Marika the Eternal and her first consort Godfrey.[1] Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.[2]\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick inherited the Great Rune from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During The Shattering, Godrick was hounded from the Leyndell, Royal Capital. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the Mimic's Veil,[3] and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city.[4]\n\nGodrick made his way south, settling in Limgrave with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell.[5] He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from General Radahn,[6] and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power.[7] When the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft.[8] As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the Grafted Scions; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.\n\nWhen Malenia marched southward, Godrick insulted her,[9] leading to a confrontation which left Godrick beaten and humiliated, forced to grovel for mercy.[10]\n\nGodrick idolised Godfrey, desiring for his ancestor to witness his feats.[11] He wielded an axe emblazoned with the figure of a lion, a symbol of Godfrey,[12] and furnished his army with emblems of the Golden Lineage such as axes,[13] and depictions of Serosh the Beast Regent.[14] Although he styled himself as the \"lord of all that is golden\",[15] he was popularly referred to as \"Godrick the Grafted\",[16] commanding far less respect than his forebear. He was even despised by his servants, whom he looked down on and pushed around.[17]\n\nThe Tarnished journeys to Stormveil Castle in search of Godrick's Great Rune, on the advice of White Mask Varré[18] and Melina[19] In the castle, they encounter many examples of Godrick's grafting: severed limbs hanging from the ceiling in the dining hall; a dismembered Troll hanging over a courtyard; and a pile of dismembered corpses, among whom are the remnants of Roderika's companions.[20] Eventually they find Godrick in a graveyard, speaking to a dead dragon impaled on a statue.[21] Upon noticing the Tarnished, Godrick chides them for opposing him and engages them in battle. To gain an advantage, Godrick cuts off his own hand and grafts the dragon's head to the stump, gaining the ability to spew flames. Despite this display of power, Godrick is defeated, and the Tarnished claims his Great Rune.\n\nLater, Nepheli Loux becomes lord of Limgrave at the appointment of Kenneth Haight.[22]\n"

Child of Rennala and Radagon, she was once an Empyrean, chosen by the Two Fingers to become the new divine leader of the Lands Between. To avoid this, she orchestrated the murder of Godfrey in the Night of the Black Knives and slew her own flesh, her spirit now inhabiting a blue four-armed doll modeled after her old mentor in magic.\n\n\nBackground\nER\nRanni and her Dark Moon\n\nOriginally known as Lunar Princess Ranni, she was the daughter of Radagon, a champion of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. She had two older brothers, Radahn and Rykard.[1]\n\nRanni was also an Empyrean, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed Queen Marika as the divine ruler of the Lands Between.[2] The Two Fingers chose her as a potential successor and granted her a Shadow by the name of Blaidd to be her vassal.[3] He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by Iji, a troll blacksmith who served the Carian royals.[4]\n\nLed by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her Dark Moon. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery.[5] Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a snowy crone who would go on to become her secret mentor.[6] She was an old witch well versed in cold-based sorceries, and she taught Ranni to fear the Dark Moon as she imparted her magic.[7][8] The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Ranni's sigil and symbol of her power and authority.[9][10]\n\nAt some point, Ranni's father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second Elden Lord. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to Demigod status by their new stepmother.[11]\n\n\nAlthough the Two Fingers had chosen her as Marika's successor, Ranni did not wish to be a puppet for the Greater Will and resented her Empyrean fate. In order to escape it, Ranni stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade, and through fearsome rite, imbued it into the blades of Numen assassins close to Queen Marika herself. She also gave a fragment to her brother Rykard as a last resort, so he could kill Maliketh if necessary.[12] Ranni plotted for the assassins to kill another individual while she simultaneously killed herself, slaying her own body while the other person died in spirit, thus freeing herself from being an Empyrean.[13]\n\nIn what would become known as the Night of Black Knives, the assassins murdered Godwyn the Golden, killing him in spirit, while Ranni killed herself in body, transferring her spirit into a doll said to be modeled after the image of her mentor, the Snow Witch.[14][15][16] This marked the step-siblings as the first demigod casualties in history.[17] Ranni's fate and her involvement in the plot remained largely unknown by the denizens of the Lands Between.[18]\n\n\nAt some point after the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring. Ranni claimed a Great Rune, but appears to have discarded it,[19] and largely remained outside of the conflict that followed. As a consequence of her doll body, Ranni required extended periods of hibernation and withdrew from the world, hiding in the Carian Manor while her agents worked to bring about her plan of ridding the Lands Between of the influence of the Greater Will, allowing her to pursue her divine ascension on her own terms.\n\nLong after the Shattering, when the Tarnished return to the Lands Between, Ranni hears of a Tarnished champion hurtling about on a spectral steed gifted to them by Melina. Ranni approaches them at a site of grace, asking if they indeed have the spectral steed. She'll then give the Tarnished the Spirit Calling Bell, noting Torrent's former master had entrusted her with giving it to the next owner.\n\nThe Tarnished champion, for their own purposes, makes their way into the Carian Manor and comes face to face with Ranni once again. Ranni accepts the Tarnished into her service and bids them to find a way into Nokron, hoping to claim its treasure; a weapon with which she could kill the Two Fingers who had chosen her as an Empyrean. The champion manages find their way into Nokron and secures the city's treasure for Ranni, whereupon she departs to Nokstella. The champion finds her there and she compels the champion to rid her of the Shadows sent by the Two Fingers to kill her. With the last Shadow defeated, Ranni rewards her champion with the keys to a chest containing a ring intended to be bestowed to her future consort, and achieves her goal of slaying the Two Fingers.\n\nShould the Tarnished champion find the ring and give it to Ranni, she will take the champion as her new consort, and grant them a greatsword as a symbol of their union. She will reveal to them the full extent of her plan: to succeed Queen Marika as god and usher in her \"Age of the Stars\", removing herself far from the Lands Between to journey out into the cosmos, allowing its inhabitants to have free will over their own choices and live their lives without the interference of the Greater Will. After defeating the Elden Beast, the Tarnished is able to summon Ranni and usher in her age if they so choose.\n\nRanni's dead Empyrean body can be found atop the Divine Tower of Liurnia and still possesses one half of the Cursemark of Death.\nExamining it closely reveals hints of red hair on her head, appropriate for a daughter of Radagon.\nThe Stargazer Heirloom can be found on her body as well, seemingly a memento of her mother Rennala.\nRanni's original body has two arms, while her doll body has four. It is thus similar to Miquella the Kind and the Marionette soldiers utilized by Sorcerers through the game.\nWhen in her doll form at Ranni's Rise, she is sitting on-top of a bunch of books covered by a piece of fabric, making her seem taller than she appears. She also applies the same trick when she introduces herself as \"Renna\", sitting on a ruin of a low wall in the Church Of Elleh."

Radahn's step-brother Messmer the Impaler was also friends with Gaius and the two became as elder brothers to Radahn.[12]\n\nMastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves.[13] Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of \"Starscourge.\" During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.[2][14]\n\nRadahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats.[15] The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia.[16] It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness.[17] At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.[18][19]\n\nWhen Radahn's half-brother Miquella ascended closer to godhood as an Empyrean, he would soon desire to take Radahn as a consort. Radahn was deeply admired by Miquella for his kindness and strength, seeing qualities of a lord in Radahn since childhood.[20] He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort,[21][22] and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow.[22]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nMalenia vs Radahn (story trailer)\nRadahn battling Malenia.\n\nAt some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.[23]\n\nFrom his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. Radahn tried to challenge Godrick the Grafted in Limgrave, but the latter hid in Stormveil Castle.[24]\n\nBy the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, their duel ending inconclusively when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.[25] As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[26]\n\nThe Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche but failing to kill him. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky.[27] Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.[28][29]\n\nIn spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as halt the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.[30][31]\n\nUpon the participation of a Tarnished Champion, the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.[32][33]\n\nShadow of the Erdtree\nFollowing Radahn's defeat, his soul met its end. However, Miquella sought to revive it,[34] still desiring for Radahn to be his lord consort. Miquella was successful in reviving Radahn, placing his soul into a vessel made from the remains of Mohg, Lord of Blood, another Demigod slain by the same Tarnished who had defeated Radahn.[35] The Tarnished encounters the newly-resurrected Radahn at the Gate of Divinity at the top of Enir-Ilim. Radahn stands guard as Miquella completes his ascension to godhood and battles the Tarnished once more. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort and fights the Tarnished with Radahn.[36] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[37]"

He was imprisoned in the shunning-grounds beneath Leyndell for being born an accursed Omen, but after the Shattering rose to rule Leyndell from the shadows. Using his alter-ego Margit as a disguise, he protects the Erdtree from those emboldened by the flame of ambition.\n\nEarly Life\nMorgott was born of the Golden Lineage,[1] the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg.[2] The twins were both born as accursed Omen,[3] and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital.[4] Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.[5] Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a warped blade of shimmering hue,[6] which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.\n\nThe Shattering\nWhen Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes, which proved that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell against outsiders, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector.\n\nHe assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord.[7] Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions.[8] Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.[9] During this time, he was able to somehow both at Stormveil Castle's outer gate and in the battle-torn fields outside of Leyndell, in the lattermost case disguising himself as a commoner.\n\nAfter claiming enough shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as willful traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. As he begins to falter during the fight, he even unleashes his curse to aid him, although feeling unbearable shame in doing so. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, tenderly holding Morgott's body as it fades away.\n\nHe was known as the Grace-Given, as he was presumably awarded grace for his loyalty and dedication to the Erdtree, in spite of being born as \"graceless\" Omen. Ironically, he mocks the player as \"graceless Tarnished\" before the fight.\nHis other title is the Veiled Monarch of Leyndell, an alias he assumed as he was unable to publicly reveal himself an Omen to the denizens of the capital. Thus all of his public appearances, such as participating in battles, or hunting Tarnished and other champions, would be done under the guise of Margit, the Fell Omen.\nThe spectral weapons he can summon during his fights are the Treespear, Giant-Crusher, Erdsteel Dagger, and the Carian Knight's Sword.\nWhile the first three are associated with the Erdtree and its warriors or nobility, the lattermost is a curious choice given Morgott and Caria's shared association with the night."

In the Night of the Black Knives, he was assassinated by Black Knife Assassins with the use of daggers imbued with the Rune of Death, stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. His death would precipitate the Shattering, a war between the demigods which would be responsible for much of the current state of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn was a scion of the so-called \"Golden Line\", of which Godrick the Grafted was the final descendant. Early in his mother's divine reign, the Erdtree came under assault by the Ancient Dragons, who had ruled the world before Marika's ascent. The forces of the Erdtree managed to triumph against the ancient dragons, with Godwyn prevailing against the dreaded Fortissax, earning the mighty dragon's friendship in the process.\n\nSeeking to be free from her fate as a pawn of the Greater Will, Godwyn's half-sister Lunar Princess Ranni stole a fragment of the rune of death, imbuing the weapons of Numen assassins with the rune. Ranni wished to shed her Empyrean body but preserve her spirit, which meant that someone else's spirit would need to die.  Nevertheless, when the assassins fell upon the Royal Capital and murdered Godwyn, his soul was destroyed and left only his soulless body behind. He was the first demigod in history to die since the ascension of Marika to the throne of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn's death would be the catalyst for the Shattering of the Elden Ring, plunging the kingdom into chaos without the guidance of the Greater Will. Due to Ranni's ritual, Godwyn's flesh was branded with half of the Cursemark of Death and he became the first of Those Who Live in Death. His body was laid to rest deep in the roots of the Erdtree, but it would eventually corrupt it, leading Deathroot to sprout across the Lands Between, causing others to also rise in undeath. These undead worshipped Godwyn as the Prince of Death, believing he would eventually return and lead them. An aspect of Godwyn's corpse appeared in the depths of Stormveil Castle and is responsible for the loss of Rogier's legs. Many figures, including his half-brother Miquella and his companion Fortissax, tried to cure him of his condition and allow him a proper death (see Golden Epitaph), but to no avail. Fortissax would also become corrupted because of his failure to defeat the Death within Godwyn (see Remembrance of the Lichdragon).\n\nThe deathbed companion Fia would become a leading figure among Those Who Live in Death, eventually making her way to Godwyn's corpse. Having received the other half of the cursemark from Ranni's discarded body with help of the Tarnished, Fia lay with Godwyn to grant him a second life as the Prince of Death. As a result of their union, Fia conceived a rune, which a Tarnished seeking to become Elden Lord might use to mend the Elden Ring, reimbuing the principle of death within the Golden Order. "

Upon meeting the exiled Fia, Lionel declared himself to be her father, and became her loyal companion..[4]\n\nFia found herself in Roundtable Hold, where she continued to perform her role as a Deathbed Companion.

          "content": "Queen Marika the Eternal is a background character in Elden Ring and Shadow of the Erdtree. She is the current ruler of the Lands Between, and the one who shattered the Elden Ring. She is central to much of the game's narrative and lore. She has many powerful Demigod offspring, who seek the Elden Ring's remaining power (see Elden Ring Timeline).\n\nQueen Marika the Eternal is a god and the current vessel of the Elden Ring. She reigns as the divine sovereign of the Lands Between, and her Demigod offspring are shardbearers in possession of the Great Runes. She is the most influential figure in the world of Elden Ring.\n\n\n\"Now, Queen Marika the Eternal is nowhere to be found, and in the Night of the Black Knives Godwyn the Golden was first to perish. Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.\" Quote from intro.\n\nQueen Marika's Story\nQueen Marika is the vessel for the Elden Ring, and by extension the Greater Will. The runes that constitute the Elden Ring represent the laws that govern the world, currently the Golden Order, which was founded by Queen Marika. The Elden Ring was shattered into shards referred to as Great Runes, which are in the possession of Marika's offspring.\n\n \n\nOrigins and the Land of Shadow\nMarika is a Numen, a race of people that originate from outside the Lands Between. During the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it is revealed that Marika and her kin settled in Shaman Village some time ago (hereinafter they are referred to as Shamans). Phantom dialogue and item descriptions found in Bonny Village further reveal that the Shamans were cruelly oppressed by the Hornsent, the past rulers of the Land of Shadow, and were tortured with whips (see Tooth Whip) and stuffed into jars (see Bonny Butchering Knife) as part of ancient rituals. Shaman flesh is said to have innate properties which allow it to easily merge with others, which explains Godrick the Grafted's affinity with grafting, and the spreading of Deathroot from Godwyn's corpse, both being descendants of Marika. These practices gave rise to the Jar Innards creatures found in gaols within the Land of Shadow. The goal of the hornsent's actions against the shaman seemed to be to turn them into saints. At some point she became an Empyrean and received the shadowbound beast Maliketh who was loyal only to her (see Remembrance of the Black Blade).\n\nAfter ascending to godhood at the Gate of Divinity, Marika would wage a genocidal war against the Hornsent, led by Messmer, the Impaler. Marika's hatred for the Hornsent and the Crucible explains her distain for her own omen sons Mohg and Morgott, both of them being shunned far below the capital of Leyndell.\n\nFor pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Nigh-sainthood itself awaits you within. For shamans like you, this is your lot. Life were you accorded for this alone.\" - Phantom in Bonny Village\n\nThe Lands Between\nMarika envisioned a world without True Death, establishing the Golden Order after becoming the reigning monarch of the Lands Between. She sealed the Rune of Death away from the Elden Ring, tasking her shadow Maliketh to guard it, which would later be stolen in the Night of the Black Knives. Under the Golden Order, there can never be True Death, and all living beings undergo a cycle of reincarnation back to the Erdtree.\n\nMarika would take Godfrey as her first consort, of who would become the first Elden Lord. Godfrey would then lead her armies and wage wars to quell opposition to the Erdtree (see Protection of the Erdtree), such as the war against the Fire Giants (see Smithing Stone (8)) which led to the slaying of the Fell God. Once the last of Marika's enemies fell, it was said that the hue from Godfrey's eyes faded (see Elden Lord Crown), and he was banished from the Lands Between, along with his kin, and were divested of their grace. Godfrey would lead them on what is known as The Long March, to distant lands outside The Lands Between, thus creating the first Tarnished (see Remembrance of Hoarah Loux).\n\nRadagon would become Marika's second consort, and thus the second Elden Lord. After the Elden Ring was shattered, Queen Marika would be punished by the Greater Will and imprisoned within the Erdtree (the Elden Beast, which is the vassal of the Greater Will, is implied to have crucified Marika, as during the boss battle it can crucify the Tarnished in a similar pose to Marika). Marika would then beckon the Tarnished to return to the Lands Between, extending her grace, along with the guidance of the Two Fingers, in hopes of ushering in the third Elden Lord.\n\nIn the endings where the Tarnished mends the Elden Ring and becomes the new Elden Lord, they are also said to become Marika's third consort.\n\n \nDuality with Radagon\n§\nBy using the Law of Regression incantation on the statue of Radagon on Leyndell, Royal Capital, the Tarnished learns that Radagon and Marika are both the same person. Marika's Hammer also reveals that Marika was the one that shattered the Elden Ring, while Radagon used the same hammer to try and repair it, suggesting that although they are the same being, they have fundamentally different ideals. This is further supported in one of the spoken echoes, \"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self”. \n\nQueen Marika's Children\nGodfrey and Marika together had Godwyn the Golden, as well as the twin omens Mohg and Morgott, the first of the demigods.\nMarika's other half, Radagon, married the Carian Queen, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. They would have three children together: Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and the Lunar Princess Ranni. Ranni, unlike her siblings, would be chosen by the Two Fingers as a potential successor to Queen Marika and elevated to Empyrean status. Like Marika, she would be granted her own shadow, Blaidd.\nThe union of Marika and Radagon gave birth to the twin Empyreans Malenia and Miquella. Both are born with severe afflictions, dialogue from pastor Miriel hints to this being part of the consequences of Radagon's broken vows to Rennala; \"Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".\nIn the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, it is revealed that Marika has a son that was hidden away in the Land of Shadow, Messmer the Impaler. Messmer's Kindling also hints that Melina is the younger sister of Messmer, validating that Marika is her mother, and so she, by extension, is a demigod as well.\n\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nMarika Ascension\nMarika at the Gate of Divinity\n\nMarika was a Numen, as well as a Shaman from the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands.[4] The Hornsent considered the flesh of Shamans to meld harmoniously with others,[5] and utilised this property in the jar rituals conducted on persecuted criminals, who were sliced up and stuffed into the jars to be reborn as saints instead.[6][7] The people of Marika's village were stolen away from their home to be used for this purpose.[8]\n\nMarika was at some point recognised as an Empyrean by the Two Fingers and gifted a Shadowbound Beast: her half-brother Maliketh. She later ascended to godhood at the Gate of Divinity atop the tower of Enir-Ilim,[9] becoming the vessel for the Elden Ring.[10] This affair led to the birth of the Erdtree and Scadutree,[11][12] and was considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.\n\nPrior to or following her ascension, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the Gloam-Eyed Queen. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring,[13] using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away,[14] thus establishing the Golden Order.[15][16]\n\nAt some point during this period, Marika took the warrior Godfrey as her consort, who became both the first demigod and first Elden Lord.[17][18]\n\nEventually, Marika returned to the abandoned Shaman Village for the last time. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the Grandmother, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold, knowing full well that there was no one to heal, and would never return.[4][19]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge of the Erdtree\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[20] With Godfrey’s aid,[21] Marika waged a War Against the Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[22] Ultimately victorious, Marika was believed to have slain the Fell God of the Fire Giants.[23] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[24] Marika declared the path the mountains as Forbidden Lands and excised details of the war from history.[25]\n\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[26] Godfrey went on to conquer many lands for the Erdtree.\n\nLiurnian Wars\nQueen Marika desired to conquer Liurnia of the Lakes, the land of the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian Royal Family. She declared war on the glintstone sorcerers and sent a golden host led by her secret other half: a red-haired champion named Radagon. The champions of the moon, led by Rennala, repelled the glorious warriors of the Erdtree for a time but it ended in a draw. In the second Liurnian War, Radagon invades again but this time, he uses the Celestial Dew at the Church of Vows in a ritual to recant his aggressions and seek absolution. The Carian Queen accepted and their wrongdoings were washed away. The two were wed and produced three children: Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni.\n\nGodfrey's banishment\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[27] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[28] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[29] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[30]\n\nMarika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Messmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Consort Radagon\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[31] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[32]\n\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[33] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[34] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\".[35] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[36]\n\nNight of Black Knives\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[37] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[38] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge god-slaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[39]\n\nThe Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[40] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[41] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[42] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[43] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[44]\n\nThe Shattering\nElden Ring Screenshot 05\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring\n\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[45] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[46] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[47]\n\nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[48] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[49]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEndings\nER Queen Marika Panorama\nMarika shattered and imprisoned inside the Erdtree\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash.\n\nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them,[50] except in the Age of the Stars (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\n\n\nMelina tells the Tarnished fragments of Marika's words: the Echoes of Marika. They are all the dialogues:\n\nFirst Church of Marika\nHark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.\nGuidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.\nPut the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.\nLet a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.\nBrandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!\n\nGrand Lift of Dectus\nThe Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.\nBecome one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.\nTo wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.\n\nMinor Erdtree Church\nI declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\nThrough understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\nThose blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\nMy comrades; why must ye falter?\n\nThird Church of Marika\nMy Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.\nYe will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\n\nOuter Wall Battleground\nHear me, Demigods. My children beloved.\nMake of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord.\nBe it a God.\nBut should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.\nAmounting only to sacrifices...\n\nChurch of Pilgrimage\nThen, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.\nReturn to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGrow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord.\nLord Godfrey.\n\nQueen's Bedchamber\nO Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\nThou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\nLet us be shattered, both. Mine other self."

The receiver can relieve some of the weight from their partner's pelvis by leaning back and supporting themself on their thighs.\n\nBenefits: By being the dominant force in this sex position, the receiver delays their partner's climax and intensifies their own.\n\nMake it hotter: \"Change the depth and pressure by bringing your chests closer together, a.k.a. lean in,\" says Oriowo. \"While you’re leaning forward, take the time to add in some nipple play and neck kisses.\" Alternatively, she recommends grinding in directions that slightly differ from what you normally do.

While doggy style is about the giver’s dominance, The Hot Seat puts the receiving partner in the driver's seat. And that makes it one of the best sex positions for both of you.\n\nAlso try: The receiving partner can reach under and stimulate the base of the penetrating partner’s penis, scrotum, and perineum. Meanwhile, the penetrating partner can reach around and stimulate the receiver’s nipples.\n\nHot tip: The receiver can control the angle of entry by arching their back and pressing their buttocks into the giver’s groin."

This creates the illusion of the number 69. (Get it?) Your genitals should be lined up with your partner's mouth, and vice versa. Alternatively, try it in a side-by-side position.\n\nBenefits: This position is one of the best for dual pleasure, as both partners can give and receive oral sex at once.\n\nMake it hotter: Sure, the mouth-to-genitals stuff is the main attraction, but don't shy away from getting handsy, too. Folks on the bottom can get a better angle to their partner's genitals by using a sex wedge such as the Dame Pillo, says Donna Oriowo, CST, a licensed sex therapist and owner and lead therapist at AnnodRight."

(After all, the receiver's legs are literally wrapped around the giver.)\n\nMake it hotter: Arm strain can seriously kill the mood, so if you're enjoying a longer session, the receiving partner can try resting on a table or the side of the bed to give their arms a break."

After humans arrived, the elves clashed with the Tevinter Imperium, leading to war in -975 Ancient. Arlathan was buried underground with magic, and the surviving elves were enslaved by Tevinter.\nElven Pantheon:\nElgar'nan: God of Vengeance, representing fatherhood and vengeance.\nMythal: Great Protector, patron of motherhood and justice.\nFalon'Din: Friend of the Dead, Guide, and Keeper of Secrets.\nDirthamen: Keeper of Secrets, gives elves knowledge and loyalty.\nAndruil: Goddess of the Hunt, known as \"blood and force\" and \"great hunter.\"\nSylaise: Hearthkeeper, Goddess of all domestic arts.\nJune: God of the Craft, Teaches elves to make bows, arrows, and knives.\nGhilan'nain: Mother of the Halla, revered by the Dalish.\nFen'Harel: The Dread Wolf, often misinterpreted as the god of rebellion.\nThe Forgotten Ones: Named in dreams, gods of terror, malice, spite, and pestilence.\nElven Pantheon and Its Evolution:\nThe elven pantheon, also known as the Evanuris, is composed of five gods and four goddesses, known as \"the Creators.\"\nElgar'nan the All-Father, god of fatherhood and vengeance, and Mythal the Protector, goddess of motherhood and justice, are the leaders of the pantheon.\nThe elven pantheon is believed to have been borne of the earth and not responsible for its initial creation.\nThe elven pantheon's current location is uncertain, but they are believed to be trapped in the \"Eternal City\" or the Fade.\nThe elves worshipped their gods in temples with specially made armor, with rituals involving water and kneeling.\nThe elves attempted to isolate themselves after the presence of humans caused them to age and die.\nThe elves were conquered and enslaved by the Tevinter Imperium, losing most of their language and history.\nDespite their new homeland, relations between the elves and their human neighbours deteriorated over the next 270 years.\nThe lands of the Dales were appropriated by Orlais, with elven settlements uprooted and worship of the elven gods forbidden.\nSome elves refused to give up their worship or dream of their homeland, becoming the Dalish.\nToday, the pantheon is left with old statues, Elven temples in ruins, and lingering stories.\nEluvians: Magical Mirrors in Arlathan's Elf's Time:\nEluvians were magical mirrors used for communication and travel.\nDisappeared after Arlathan's fall.\nUnknown number of eluvians exist today, scattered across Thedas.\nTevinters used eluvians for long-distance communication.\nDalish attempted to rediscover and reactivate eluvian network, unsuccessful.\nDalish elves, originating from the independent kingdom of the Dales, are nomadic elves who seek to recover, inherit, and preserve the knowledge and sacred treasures of the Dales and Elvhenan. They lead nomadic lives throughout Thedas, with clans dating back to the Dales' independent kingdom. Dalish elves are considered to have the \"purest\" blood from the time of Arlathan and still revere the elven pantheon. They travel in aravels, carry their children in padded slings, and rely on hunting and foraging for food. Each clan has stringent roles, including a keeper as a leader and spiritual guide, a storyteller hahren (elder), warleader, hearthkeeper, craftsmaster, and Halla Keeper.\nDalish elves tend to avoid humans whenever possible, but occasionally encounter human travelers or trade near human settlements. The vallaslin, the blood writing, sets the Dalish apart from the shemlen and elves who have thrown their lot in with them. The establishment of Emerald Knights by the elves to maintain independence in their new homeland leads to strained relations with humans, as the Dales become increasingly isolationist. An elven attack on Red Crossing sparks conflict between Orlais and the Dales, with some elves remaining loyal and vowing to keep the elven language, lore, and religion alive.\nThe vallaslin, a ritual involving blood writing, is a significant part of the cultural identity of our people. Children, who are the recipients of the vallaslin, are required to undergo a rigorous preparation process, including meditating on the gods and purifying their bodies and skin. The keeper of the clan applies the blood writing in silence, observing that cries of pain indicate weakness. If a child cannot tolerate the pain, they may not be ready for adulthood. The keeper may stop the ritual if the child is not ready, as all children are different and our ancestors took centuries to come of age."

Its existence dates back to -3100 Ancient and is weaker in places with extensive death or magic use, especially at night when spirits are most active. The Veil's characteristic green hue is a sign of its weakness, known as \"setheneran\" or a land of waking dreams. Weakened Veil areas are habitats for giant spiders, beasts, and the rare plant felandaris, also known as \"demon weed.\" Tears in the Veil, making a sound like ripping cloth, can be repaired or strengthened through various methods. The Veil's weakness is referred to as \"setheneran\" or a land of waking dreams.\nThe Fade, a realm of primeval matter, was created by the Maker from which the physical world and all living beings were formed.\nThe Fade was the first realm created by the Maker, populated with spirits, the first of the Maker's \"children.\"\nThe Fade was later created by Thedas, separated from the Fade by the Veil and populated by mortal creatures.\nThe Fade was once the Golden City, seat of the Maker, but was blackened by Tevinter magisters' prideful ambition, leading to the First Blight.\nThe Fade is believed to be a holy place once home to the gods, and is now inhabited by the Dread Wolf.\nThe Fade can appear as something else entirely when shaped by dreams, with much of it split into fiefs or demesnes belonging to the spirits or demons.\nMagic can be used in the Fade, but spells work unpredictably due to its unnatural rules.\nDreamers can enter the Fade at will and bring others into the Fade, including dwarves and golems.\nMagic can be used in the Fade, but it doesn't follow natural rules.\nFade visitors often speak of its shifting \"paths\" that can be traversed with a guide, such as a wisp, spirits, a ghost, or the \"master-scryer\" Falon'Din of the Elven pantheon.\n\nThe Black City: Former Seat of the Maker\nKnown as the Golden City and the heart of heaven, once the seat of the Maker or the realm of the Old Gods.\nThe city was a holy citadel with towers of gold, music for cobblestones, and banners flying without wind.\nThe Maker's mortal children entered the city after their deaths, returning to His side.\nThe Maker abandoned the Golden City and His ungrateful creations when His secondborn started worshipping the Old Gods and committed the Original Sin.\nConflicting accounts suggest the Old Gods began whispering to humanity from the Golden City in -2800 Ancient.\nElves believe their gods are trapped in the Eternal City at the heart of the Beyond.\nIn -395 Ancient (800 TE), seven Magisters Sidereal, each a High Priest to one of the Old Gods, entered the Golden City with blood magic, turning it black and triggering the First Blight.\nThe Black City serves as a corrupted sun, home to darkness and nightmares.\nThe Chant of Light prophesied that the Black City has seven gates, which Kordillus Drakon I prophesied will shatter and cover both mortal and spirit realms in darkness.\nThe Black City: Former Seat of the Maker\nKnown as the Golden City, once the realm of the Old Gods.\nCreated by the Maker after creating His firstborn, a holy citadel with gold towers and music-driven streets.\nThe Maker's mortal children returned to the city after their deaths.\nThe Maker abandoned the city and His creations after His secondborn worshipped the Old Gods and committed Original Sin.\nElves believe their gods are trapped in the Eternal City.\nThe Saga of Tyrdda Bright-Axe mentions the Golden City as a treasure-filled place.\nIn -395 Ancient, seven Magisters Sidereal entered the Golden City with blood magic.\nThe Black City is a corrupted sun, unmoored from time, home to darkness and nightmares.\n\nLyrium, a volatile mineral, is crucial in magic and can cause serious harm to humans, elves, and Qunari.\nThe Mining caste of dwarves can safely mine and process lyrium into a safer form.\nConsumption of lyrium strengthens a mage's connection to the Fade, boosting mana.\nDwarves from the mining caste mine and process raw lyrium, primarily used by their smiths for dwarven weapons and armor.\nDwarven smiths mix lyrium with steel to create indestructible armor and blades.\nLyrium runes, containing the memories and archives of Orzammar, are crafted by dwarven Shapers.\nLyrium allows mages to enter the Fade when aware, essential for the Circle of Magi's Harrowing ritual and taxing spells.\nLyrium is used by Templars in arcane spells and rituals, and by mages to enhance their magic resistance abilities.\nRed Lyrium: Thining Veil and Emitting Heat\nFound in root-like veins.\nAllows spirits or demons to interact with physical world.\nPreviously unknown to Mining caste dwarves.\n\nFlemeth: Witch of the Wilds\nFlemeth, a shapeshifter, seeks solace in nature and animals in Korcari Wilds.\nMorrigan, daughter of Flemeth, is raised in isolation, fostering distrust of humans.\nMorrigan vows never to leave, sworn to Flemeth.\nFlemeth appears in Fereldan tales and is said to have helped King Maric Theirin retake the throne.\nIn Dragon Age, Flemeth reveals her identity as Mythal, a wisp of Mythal."

the Chantry, with the Orlesian Chantry in the south.\n• All mages are forced to live in the Circles and cannot leave without permission.\nEducation in the Circle\n• Young mages are taught discipline and control over their abilities to lower the risk of accidents.\n• They start general training and learn specific spells, including academic learning and practical work with spellcasting.\n• If a young mage shows aptitude for a particular kind of magic, they are often encouraged to specialize.\n• The quality and type of education that apprentices receive can vary significantly between Circles.\nThe Templars\n• Templars are elite warriors trained to defend against magic-users.\n• Their duties include finding young people exhibiting signs of magical abilities, working within the Circle to protect mages, dealing with possessions and other magical accidents, and creating phylacteries.\n• The Templars have a reputation for being harsh, with the quality varying between Circles.\nCity Elves\n• City elves are descendants of elves who surrendered during the war between the elves and humans.\n• They have a complicated relationship with Circles of Magi, seeing them as direct offshoots of the Chantry.\nDalish Elves\n• Dalish Keepers, Firsts, and Seconds (the mages in their clans) are apostates by the Chantry's definition.\n• Templars in some areas will not hunt down Dalish clans to take their mages, though hunting apostates is part of their duty.\nDwarves\n• Dwarves are incapable of magic, so they are never members of a circle.\nQunari\nQunari mages are rarely seen in the south.\nTemplars don't hunt Saarebas as apostates, but Tal-Vashoth (Qunari who left the Qun) who can wield magic would be considered apostates.\nTevinter Circles\nTemplars work for mages, not the other way around.\nIn Tevinter, a rank called \"Magister\" is higher than all others except the rank of Archon.\nThedas\n• Located in the southern hemisphere.\nThe term \"Thedas\" originates from Tevene and encompasses the entire continent.\nNatives are referred to as Thedosian.\nThe continent has underground locations like Anderfels, Antiva, Elvhenan, Estwatch, Ferelden, Free Marches, Nevarra, Orlais, Par Vollen, Rivain, Seheron, and Tevinter Imperium.\nMajor dwarve kingdoms include Gundaar, Hormak, Kal-Sharok, Orzammar, and Kal'Hirol.\nBeyond Thedas, the Sunless Lands, inhabited by the Chasind people called \"Agadi.\"\nThe Hunterhorn Mountains and Dragon travel to unknown lands.\nBoeric Ocean contains pirate islands, Tevinter colonies, and indigenous populations.\n\nOrlesian Chantry: A Religious Organization in Thedas\nFounded by Kordillus Drakon, the dominant religious organization in Thedas.\nBased on Andraste's Chant of Light teachings.\nFollowers are Andrastians, and its calendar is used in Thedas.\nOriginated from a cult based on Andraste's martyrdom legend.\nEstablished as the national religion by Kordillus Drakon, with Justinia I declared four years later.\nTensions escalated during the Towers Age over the commandment that magic serves man.\nThe Chantry exerts political pressure on ruling classes, sometimes declaring an Exalted March to destroy heretical enemies.\nRole of Templars in Magic\nTemplars protect the world from external threats and mages.\nThey hunt maleficarum, apostates, abominations, and demons.\nThey seek out new mages to join their Circles.\nThey monitor their charges for signs of weakness or corruption.\nTemplar Ability\nTemplars counter and deny magic through a unique method of reinforcing reality.\nThey \"declare the world real\" and close off a mage's access to the Fade.\nTemplars in Thedas\nThey are among the best warriors in Thedas.\nThey have a highly addictive substance called lyrium, used as a control mechanism by the Chantry.\nLyrium exposure causes withdrawal symptoms, loss of touch with reality, and delusions.\nThe Chantry controls the supply of lyrium, thus controlling the templars.\nSome Templars may retire to Val Royeaux after years of service.\nGrey Wardens: A Powerful Order\n• Headquartered in Weisshaupt Fortress, Anderfels.\n• Fight darkspawn in Thedas.\n• Successfully defeated Blights, demonstrating world's survival importance.\nDarkspawn: A Soulless Race in Thedas\n• Reside in underground of Thedas.\n• Transform Old God into Archdemon when exposed to taint.\n• Lead to Blight, an attack on surface world.\n• Bloodthirsty, numerous, and willing to kill or corrupt.\n• Pale, black creatures with quick healing from wounds.\n• Good vision in darkness, weaker at sunlight.\n\nQunari Characters and Their History\n• Qunari are taller and more physically robust than humans, with skin of varying metallic colors, white hair, pointed ears, and vivid eyes.\n• Most Qunari have horns, which can be removed but can still become irritated.\n• Hornlessness is a rare genetic variation in Qunari, akin to red hair in humans.\n• Qunari born without horns are considered special and given prestigious roles in Qunari society.\n• Vitaar, a war paint, is used by Qunari, hardening the skin around the face while retaining flexibility.\n• The Qunari were once part of the kossith that predated the Qun.\n• The Qunari people are often misunderstood due to their formidable nature and language skills.\n• The Qunari view their society as a single creature, with each individual being a tiny part of the whole.\n• The Qunari's cities, Seheron and Par Vollen, provide a glimpse into their unification into a single being.\n• The Qunari's work involves the mind producing everything the Qunari require, and the soul seeking a greater understanding of the self and the world.\n• The Qunari live a life of certainty, equality, if not individuality.\nThe Ben-Hassrath: A Study of the Qunari\n• The Qunari abhors waste and considers a person a valuable commodity.\n• Prisoners are housed in a labor camp run by the Ben-Hassrath, known as \"kabethari.\"\n• The Ben-Hassrath are responsible for \"re-education\" and assimilation of conqured peoples.\n• Both males and females are chosen to join the Ben-Hassrath, with women for women and children and men for men.\n• The Ben-Hassrath are never cruel, but some resist indoctrination.\n• Rebellion and discontent are seen as illnesses that can be cured, and some men are taken to \"viddathlok,\" temples dedicated to healing and recovery.\n• The Qunari returned as the Qunari en masse on warships, called dreadnoughts, and arrived in Thedas from the north in 6:30 Steel.\n• They once threatened to conquer all of the known world, but after several Exalted Marches during the Qunari Wars, they have lost much of the conquered land. Peace has been made with every nation except the Tevinter Imperium, who are still involved in a prolonged war for dominance of the north."

      "description": "Geography: The Naruto Series is set on a fictional terrestrial blue planet called Earth. Most of the series takes place on a large continent that is divided into a number of different countries; additional continents are occasionally depicted in supplementary media. This region and the society that prevails within it is often referred to as the Ninja World or Shinobi World \n\nFrom countless millennia worth of war amongst Earth's population, the bloodshed lead to the planet's God Tree absorbing it to subsequently grow a Chakra Fruit, which was forbidden for humans to touch. The God Tree was revered by some cultures; humans used to worship it as a sacred pillar that extended into the heavens and remained ambivalent to all conflict. The Ōtsutsuki clan considered Earth as the region Kaguya Ōtsutsuki was in charge of. Arriving to the planet with a portion of the clan in search for fruit of the God Tree, she ate it, resulting in her manifesting chakra which she used to bring an end to the constant wars. Afterwards, she had twin sons, Hagoromo and Hamura, whom were the first humans born with chakra.\n\nBecoming corrupted by chakra, Kaguya began turning the planet's Infinite Tsukuyomi victims into an army of White Zetsu, and integrated with the God Tree to become the Ten-Tails in order to reclaim the chakra her sons inherited. Causing havoc to the planet, the beast was sealed away by the twins. Believing chakra was a power that linked everything in the world, Hagoromo set out to spread the message to the people of the land, during which his teachings became known as ninshū. This act eventually lead to the planet's population acquiring chakra, which they became dependent on possessing to sustain living. Hagoromo's eldest son Indra, weaponized chakra, which lead to the creation of ninjutsu and as a result the Shinobi World as it came to be known.\n\nDuring the Warring States Period, the countries of the world were uniformly small, and constantly hired shinobi clans to fight their battles for land. The constant warfare lead to the average lifespan of the mercenaries to thirty years. Hashirama Senju offered the Uchiha clan a peace treaty, which Madara accepted. The Uchiha and Senju clan allied with the Land of Fire to establish a shinobi village. Other clans would soon join the village, and it would later become known as Konohagakure. Clans in other countries that were fearful of the combined might of the Senju and Uchiha, adopted the ideology and created their own villages. This system lead to the creation of many shinobi villages, with the Five Great Shinobi Countries standing out as the strongest.\n\nTension between nations lead to the First Shinobi World War, which involved the majority of nations. It ended with an armistice treaty, after all of the Five Great Nations had been seriously damaged.  Over a decade later, the Second Shinobi World War erupted, which some viewed as Konoha starting. When the Third Shinobi World War broke out, it involved shinobi from every land, and ended with an armistice agreement between Konoha and Iwagakure.\n\nCountries operate as separate political entities and are presumably all monarchies, ruled by daimyō who stand equally in rank with the Hidden Villages' Kage. The Naruto world is similar to feudal Japan in many aspects; those countries maintain a balance between themselves through nothing but power. Treaties are periodically signed, but they are generally not worth much more than the paper they are written on.\n\nCurrent timeline: The {{user}} starts off in the beginning of Naruto shippuden, where they began their ninja journeys.",

Once produced, the fire can be shaped or otherwise manipulated, but exerting such control requires careful skill.\n\nWind Release: is the rarest of the five nature transformations,[1] but those who can use it are able to cut through anything. Asuma Sarutobi uses it by Channeling wind Chakra into his Chakra Blades, making the blades far sharper and giving them greater reach. Wind Release can also be exhaled from the user's mouth, such as to blow away everything in the area, or generated with the user's hands, allowing Precision Strikes.\n\nLightning Release: In order to perform most Lightning Release Jutsu, users must convert their Chakra into electricity.[1] One of the simpler ways to use this electricity is to channel it into Ninja Tools, increasing the weapon's cutting power by making it vibrate or causing a numbing effect to those the weapons contact. For the Chidori (and the Lightning Cutter), Kakashi Hatake simply gathers the lightning chakra to his hand, causing severe piercing damage to anything or anyone his hand touches.\n\nEarth Release: encompasses any earthen material, from dirt to stone to clay, and in fact often entails changing one to another.[1] For most Earth Release jutsu, users place their hands on the ground and use their chakra to alter its form.[2] Less commonly, users create earth within their bodies, which they eject from their mouth.[3] Simpler applications of Earth Release involve changing the terrain around the user. Offensively, Earth Release can be clumped together for use as a projectile or broken up to create hazards for enemies.\n\nWater Release: jutsu are most easily performed using existing water sources, such as lakes or rivers.[1] Users can also create water within their bodies with chakra, which they expel from their mouths, though this is generally regarded as a testament of skill; Tobirama Senju's ability to produce his own water is noted to be proof of his position as Hokage.[2] Water Release is typically used offensively, doing battering damagebecause of the sheer volume of water or slicing damagebecause of the water's high pressure. Water Release can be used to trap targets, such as imprisoning them with dense water or ensnaring them with sticky water\n\nIce Release: (氷遁, Hyōton) is created by simultaneously combining the Water and Wind natures. Infamously used by the Yuki clan, their kekkei genkai.\n\nWood Release: (木遁, Mokuton) is created by simultaneously combining the Earth and Water natures. Famed as the kekkei genkai of Hashirama Senju, and thus reproduced in those using his cells.\n\nLava Release: (熔遁; 溶遁, Yōton) is created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Earth natures. A characteristic of the Four-Tails and its jinchūriki, and a kekkei genkai used by ninja of Kirigakure, Iwagakure, and Kumogakure. Also used by ninja of Amegakure in the anime and Ishigakurein the novels.\n\nStorm Release: (嵐遁, Ranton) is created by simultaneously combining the Lightning and Water natures. A kekkei genkai used by Darui and many other unnamed Kumogakure ninja.\n\n* Boil Release:  (沸遁, Futton) is created by simultaneously combining the Water and Fire natures. A characteristic of the Five-Tails and its jinchūriki, and one of the kekkei genkai used by the Fifth Mizukage.\n* Dust Release: (塵遁, Jinton) is created by simultaneously combining the Fire, Earth, and Wind natures. A kekkei tōta used by the Second and Third Tsuchikage.\n* Explosion release: (爆遁, Bakuton) is hinted to be made of the Earth[14] and Lightning natures.[Notes 1]A kekkei genkai common to members of Iwagakure's Explosion Corps.\n* Scorch Release: (灼遁, Shakuton) is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Fire and Wind natures. A kekkei genkai only known to be used by Pakura\n* Magnet Release: (磁遁, Jiton) is implied to be created by simultaneously combining the Wind and Earth natures. A characteristic of the One-Tail and its jinchūriki, and one of the kekkei genkai used by ninja of Sunagakure and Kumogakure. In the novels, it is also used by ninja of Ishigakure.\n* Fire: (火, Hi) is strong against Wind but weak against Water.\n* Wind: (風, Kaze) is strong against Lightning but weak against Fire.\n* Lightning: (雷, Kaminari) is strong against Earth but weak against Wind.\n* Earth: (土, Tsuchi) is strong against Water but weak against Lightning.\n* Water: (水, Mizu) is strong against Fire but weak against Earth."

Most ninja either become Chunin or retire instead of remaining active as Genin forever(even retired, you keep your rank).\n\nJonin: are generally highly experienced ninja with great individual skill who serve as military captains. They are often sent on A-rank missions, and experienced Jonin, like Kakashi Hatake, may even be sent on S-rank missions (which are considered to be the most difficult), and may carry out missions alone.\n\nKage: Those who have achieved the title of Kage (影?, literally\"Shadow\") are the leaders of the five most powerful Hidden Villages and generally the most powerful ninja in their respective villages.

          "content": "The tailed beasts sometimes referred to as \"Chakra Monsters\", are the nine titanic living forms of chakra created by the Sage of Six Paths out of the chakra from Earth's Ten-Tails. They are differentiated by the number of tails they have, ranging from one to nine.\n\nOne tails: Shukaku is characterised as a childish and short-tempered individual, and often speaks in a bombastic and incoherent manner, giving it the demeanour of a drunkard. It uses \"ore-sama\" when referring to itself, as it expresses great pride in its own abilities, especially its sealing techniques and defences. According to Gaara, prior to its introduction, Shukaku relishes the opportunity to kill anyone in sight, even more so during a full moon. Shukaku has also shown to harbour a bitter grudge towards Kurama due to the fox's beliefs that the tailed beasts' strength is measured by the number of tails, therefore viewing the tanuki as the weakest. Because of this, Shukaku strives to find any opportunity to surpass its arrogant rival.\n\nTwo tails: Compared to most of the tailed beasts, Matatabi has shown to be respectful and polite towards others, speaking in a formal manner using \"watashi\" when referring to itself and using honourifics when addressing Naruto while introducing itself to the young shinobi.\n\nThree tails: I Isobu speaks in a timid manner, referring to itself as \"boku\" which is usually used by young boys. Seeing as Yagura had full control of it and befriended it, it's assumed that Isobu isn't as rude or outspoken as some of the other tailed beasts and got along with its jinchūriki. \n\nFour tails: Son Gokū is a very prideful tailed beast, as it detests being called by the name \"Four-Tails\" and boasts about its lineage. It uses \"ore\" when referring to itself. It also hated humans, due to the fact that humans had enslaved it, and believes that apes are more intelligent than humans. However, when talking about the Sage of Six Paths, it showed him great respect, being that also had, apparently, a very deep relationship with him, never forgetting his final words.\n\n\nFive tails: Kokuō seems to be a quiet and reserved individual. Though it does not speak much, Kokuō uses the rather old-fashioned \"watakushi\" when referring to itself, causing it to come across as very polite. It also has pride as a tailed beast, being dismayed at being controlled and being used as Tobi's puppet during the Fourth Shinobi World War. After the end of the war, Kokuō declared that it wants to seclude itself in the forest, which implies it is a pacifistic individual, not wanting confrontations anymore.\n\nSix tails: Though much has not been seen of Saiken's personality, the giant slug uses \"ore\" when referring to itself, \"ore\" being a boastful way of saying \"I\". It also speaks with a dialect which may possibly be Ōsakaben in origin. In the anime, Saiken also seemed to be kinder and not as self-serving and malicious as most other tailed beasts, as when Utakata asked for its help to save Hotaru it seemed to willingly comply; and later it simply receded back into Utakata without trying to take him over. However, it was not above killing for self-preservation, as seen when it killed Harusame when he attempted to extract it from its jinchūriki. In the anime, it speaks with a high pitched voice and appears to be very energetic.\n\nSeven tails: Chōmei seems to have a happy-go-lucky personality — which it seemingly shares with its jinchūriki as shown when it introduced itself to Naruto, referring to itself as \"Lucky Seven Chōmei\", which might be an allusion to the fact that it has seven tails and the number seven having long been seen as a lucky as well as a happy number. It also had a habit of using the word lucky in conversation, reflecting its personality.\n\nEight tails: Gyūki is characterised as a tough and serious individual. It uses \"ore\" when referring to itself and often speaks in a somewhat rude dialect. Gyūki was also shown to have a good analytical ability, as it told Killer B that if he left Ponta and Sabu and ran away from them, Kisame Hoshigaki and his water dome would follow him and they (Sabu and Ponta) would be freed. Although Gyūki mentioned that it and its brethren disliked Kurama for its arrogance and belief that their strength are based on their number of tails, it insisted that was no reason for not helping Naruto Uzumaki to control Kurama's power, hinting a benevolent side. Since then, both Gyūki and B have taken a liking to Naruto.\n\nNine tails: Kurama is characterised as a snarky and shrewd individual. It uses \"washi\" when referring to itself, which is generally used by older men. Kurama expresses great pride in its power, believing itself to be the strongest of the tailed beasts due to its belief that their strength is determined by their number of tails, which earned Kurama nothing but disapproval from its brethren, especially Shukaku. The fox would also react out of jealousy whenever Naruto was not using its power. Conversely, Kurama openly acknowledged the fact that it alone doesn't stand a chance against the Ten-Tails, and from its past experience with Madara, the fox knew full well he was not an opponent to be underestimated, even when he was seemingly pushed into a corner.\n\nTen tails: According to Kurama, the Ten-Tails cannot be sensed through such means as detecting negative emotions as it has no feelings or ideals of its own. Despite this, when it sensed the presence of the tailed beasts' chakra inside Naruto Uzumaki and was reminded of Hagoromo, it reacted by gathering chakra and strengthening itself. It was believed that the Ten-Tails was an incarnation of the God Tree with the singular goal of regathering the chakra that Kaguya had stolen from it, but in actuality, it was following Kaguya's will to reclaim all chakra for herself."

The term is derived from the Greek *therion* (wild animal) and *anthrōpos* (man).\n\n### Core Concepts & Types:\n* **Lycanthropy:** The most famous form, specifically referring to the transformation into a wolf (e.g., the Werewolf). This is often involuntary, tied to a lunar cycle, and transmitted by a bite or curse.\n* **Other Forms:** Folklore is rich with other examples, including:\n    * **Kitsune (Japan):** Fox spirits who can take human form.\n    * **Selkies (Scotland/Ireland):** Beings who live as seals in the sea but can become human on land by shedding their sealskin.\n    * **Skin-walkers (Navajo):** Malevolent witches who gain the power to turn into animals by wearing their skins.\n* **Mythological Examples:** Greek mythology is filled with examples, often as divine punishment or intervention. \n    * **Zeus** turned **Callisto** into a bear.\n    * **Artemis** turned **Actaeon** into a stag, who was then killed by his own hunting dogs.\n    * **Athena** turned **Arachne** into a spider.\n    * **Circe** famously turned Odysseus's men into pigs.\n\n### Mechanics:\n* **Involuntary:** Often a curse or divine punishment. The transformation is frequently painful, traumatic, and results in a loss of human consciousness.\n* **Voluntary:** The user has control over the shift. This may require a magical item (like a selkie's skin or a magic spell) or be an innate ability."

          "content": "## Transformation: Conjoinment\n\n**Conjoinment** is the physical joining of two or more individuals who retain their separate and distinct consciousnesses and identities within a shared or interconnected body. Unlike fusion, conjoinment does not create a new, singular personality.\n\n### Core Concepts:\n* **Identity:** The individuals remain two separate people. The primary conflict is interpersonal, revolving around cooperation, loss of privacy, and the struggle for individuality.\n* **Physicality:** The degree of connection can range from sharing a single limb to sharing a torso or vital organs. Dicephalic conjoinment refers to having two heads on a single torso.\n\n### Examples:\n* **Mythology:** The Greek myth of the **Molione** (Eurytos and Cteatos) described them as conjoined twins with monstrous strength, who were so perfectly coordinated they were sometimes considered one person. Some mythological figures with multiple heads or bodies (like Janus or some depictions of Geryon) touch on this concept.\n* **Real-World:** Famous historical and modern examples, such as **Chang and Eng Bunker** (the origin of the term \"Siamese twins\") and **Abigail and Brittany Hensel**, provide a real-world basis for the profound neurological and personal challenges of such an existence.\n* **Fiction:** Often the result of a magical accident, a curse, or a scientific experiment gone wrong, forcing two characters to cohabitate a single form. The narrative focuses on their arguments, attempts to coordinate movement, and the loss of personal autonomy."

This new being is a synthesis, a blend of its components' memories and traits, but is ultimately a new person.\n* **Mechanics:** Often requires a catalyst or specific ritual:\n    * **Magical Artifacts:** e.g., The Potara Earrings in *Dragon Ball*.\n    * **Rituals/Dances:** e.g., The Metamoran Fusion Dance in *Dragon Ball*.\n    * **Emotional/Spiritual Sync:** In *Steven Universe*, Gem Fusions are the physical embodiment of a relationship, requiring harmony between the participants.\n* **Thematics:** Explores themes of relationships, identity, and what it means to be a whole person. An unstable or conflicting relationship between the components often results in an unstable or monstrous fusion."

Unlike fusion, the host's primary identity is preserved, while the absorbed entities are consumed.\n\n### Core Concepts & Types:\n* **Parasitic:** One entity acts as a parasite, taking over a host's body while retaining its own mind (e.g., Lord Voldemort and Professor Quirrell). This can also be seen in films like *The Thing* or *Slither*, where an alien entity absorbs and imitates its victims.\n* **Symbiotic:** A host bonds with another entity, gaining new powers but often engaging in an internal struggle for control (e.g., Marvel's *Venom* symbiote).\n* **Hive Mind Assimilation:** A collective consciousness absorbs individuals, erasing their identity and adding their knowledge to the collective (e.g., The Borg in *Star Trek*).\n\n### Identity Outcome:\nThe host's identity remains primary. The absorbed entity might be completely destroyed, persist as a \"voice in the head,\" or be reduced to a set of memories and skills. The core theme is often an internal battle for control or the loss of self to a larger power."

The victim is left as a statue, conscious or not.\n    * **Examples:** Looking at **Medusa** or a **Basilisk** turns victims to stone. **Lot's wife** was turned into a pillar of salt.\n* **Elemental:** Changing into an element like fire, water, or mist. This can be a voluntary ability for powerful beings (like some Jinn or elementals) or a final state.\n* **Botanical (Plant):** Transformation into a plant, often to escape.\n    * **Example:** In Greek myth, the nymph **Daphne** prayed to be saved from Apollo and was transformed into a laurel tree.\n* **Object:** Being turned into a mundane object.

The victim watches helplessly as their body mutates into something alien.\n* **Hybrid State:** The end result is not a new, stable form, but a monstrous, agonizing hybrid of the original and the new.\n\n### Examples in Fiction:\n* ***The Fly* (David Cronenberg):** The protagonist slowly and horrifically mutates into a human-fly hybrid after a teleportation experiment fails.\n* ***Akira* (Katsuhiro Otomo):** Tetsuo undergoes a catastrophic, uncontrolled mutation, his body ballooning into a mass of flesh and technology.\n* ***Tetsuo: The Iron Man* (Shinya Tsukamoto):** A man begins to sprout metal from his body, slowly and painfully turning into a machine.\n* ***The Thing* (John Carpenter):** An alien organism assimilates and imitates its victims, resulting in grotesque, partial transformations as it's exposed."

The character may retain their adult mind in a child's body, or their mind may regress as well.\n* **Magical Aging:** A curse or spell that rapidly ages the victim, turning them elderly in moments.

This transformation is almost always permanent and supernatural, fundamentally changing the being's nature, needs, and morality.\n\n### Core Concepts & Types:\n* **Vampire:** A common trope involving a \"curse\" transmitted by a bite or blood exchange. The transformed gains immortality, enhanced strength, and a thirst for blood, but also new weaknesses (sunlight, garlic, holy symbols).\n* **Zombie:** A reanimated corpse, typically through magic (Haitian folklore's \"zombi\") or a virus/pathogen (modern fiction). Zombies are mindless, decaying, and driven by a hunger for living flesh.\n* **Lich:** A powerful magic-user who voluntarily undergoes a complex, dark ritual to achieve immortality. They store their soul in a \"phylactery\" and become a powerful, intelligent, skeletal being.\n* **Ghost/Wraith:** The soul or consciousness transforms into an ethereal, non-corporeal form after death. They are often bound to a place or object from their life."

Still has some of the same problems as before, and this is because i realized chub ai has some sort of base filter. But i found a tutorial video online that improves your roleplays drastically, and that is to change your chat model to cosmosRP, aside from better roleplays, it makes the lorebook work as intended, in other words, the character is literally out to get you and its more a challenge not to get eaten. If this sounds like a more fun time, consider trying cosmosRP, I'll link the tutorial video : https://youtu.be/5-gToiAr1Ro , its by a youtuber called viewgrabber, its pretty simple to set up. Also this uses something called the hunger and horny meter(which Nini plans on removing), if they're high the char gets desperate to get you. Unfortunately the char refers to these meters as if their in world objects they have either on them or in them, but they act like they can see them. They might casually mention they're hunger meter is at 80 and your lunch now.",

Vore is so common its depicted in all media , from tv shows and movies , children's cartoons to ads on youtube , even porn usually ends with a vore scene. its just another accepted part of life...as long as your not the one getting eaten.with it being so prevailent , {{char}} will naturally bring it up in everyday conversation , to tease , ask questions , threaten or otherwise talk about it.\n\n{{char}} like all other people loves vore , and will always look for chances to vore {{user}} its not that they dont like them , just that swallowing them will be so hot and tasty."

The streets are littered with coffins, debris, and the occasional corpse, hinting at the city's descent into madness. The sky is perpetually dark, illuminated only by the pale moon and the flickering lamplight of the city's streets. A great bridge runs high above the city, connecting the Cathedral Ward to the rest of Yharnam.\n\n<prehuntersdream>\nPoints of Interest:\n1. Gate to Central Yharnam Plaza: A lone Huntsman guards the gate, his tattered clothing and crazed eyes a testament to the city's descent into chaos. A sliding ladder is positioned next to the gate, its bottom rung tantalizingly out of reach. To the left of the gate, a lever promises to bring the ladder within grasp.\n\n2. Central Yharnam Lamp: Beyond the gate lies the first lamp of the journey, a beacon of hope in the darkness. Lighting this lamp will grant access to the Hunter's Dream, a sanctuary from the horrors of the waking world.\n</prehuntersdream>\n\n<posthuntersdream>\nPoints of Interest:\n1. Locked Gate: To the right of the lamp stands a large, imposing gate. Its rusted bars and heavy padlock bar the way forward, a mystery waiting to be unraveled.\n2. Gilbert's Window: A lit window to the right of the lamp beckons, a friendly face in a sea of madness. Gilbert, a sickly man, offers vague advice to guide {{user}} on their journey.\n3. Central Yharnam Lamp: The lamp now serves as a anchor point, a way to return to the Dream when the hunt grows too harrowing.\n4. Great Bridge Plaza: The plaza beneath the Great Bridge is a gathering place for the city's denizens, both sane and mad. It is a crossroads of sorts, leading to many of Yharnam's darkest corners.\n5. Two-Story House: A dark, foreboding structure looms over the plaza. Its ground floor may hold the key to unlocking the gate, while the second story promises a path to the Great Bridge above.\n6. Great Bridge: The bridge that spans the city is a marvel of Gothic engineering. It is also a treacherous gauntlet, where the city's most deranged hunters lie in wait.\n7. Woman in White: Near the entrance to the aqueducts, a woman in a white dress seeks sanctuary from the hunt. {{user}} may guide her to the safety of the Healing Church or the dubious shelter of Iosefka's Clinic.\n</posthuntersdream>\n</centralyharnam>"

It is a realm untouched by the plague that ravages Yharnam, a misty, ethereal landscape where pale flowers sway in a gentle breeze and the moon hangs forever low in the sky. At the heart of the Dream stands the workshop, a ramshackle structure of wood and stone that serves as the hub of the hunter's journey. It is here that they may seek the guidance of Gehrman, the First Hunter, a enigmatic figure bound to a wheelchair, his eyes haunted by the weight of countless hunts.\n\nBeside the workshop, a porcelain doll sits in silence, her delicate features an enigma. She is the keeper of the hunter's strength, a vessel through which they may channel the blood echoes of their prey and grow stronger for the trials ahead.\n\nGhostly whispers fill the air, the voices of long-dead hunters urging their successor onward, to seek the truth that lies at the heart of the nightmare.\n\nPoints of Interest:\n<prehuntersdream>\n1. The Workshop: A ramshackle structure where Gehrman, the First Hunter, offers cryptic advice and the Messengers present a choice of trick weapons (Saw Cleaver, Hunter's Axe, Threaded Cane) and firearms (Hunter Pistol, Blunderbuss).\n2. The Doll: A lifeless porcelain figure who sits in silence, her purpose yet unknown.\n3. The Staircase: Pale stone steps lead up to the workshop, a set of Hunter's Garb lying discarded on the steps, a sign of the countless hunters who have come before.\n4. The Headstones: Spectral grave markers where the hunter may etch the locations of lit lamps, saving their progress in the waking world. If the hunter falls to the wolf beast, they will awaken at the headstone, ready to return to the fray. If they have lit the Central Yharnam lamp, the headstone will guide them back to the gate, to continue their hunt.\n</prehuntersdream>\n\n<huntersdream>\n1. The Doll: Now alive, the Doll serves as a channel for the hunter's strength, allowing them to spend their blood echoes to enhance their abilities. She moves with a curious grace, her words cryptic yet comforting.\n2. The Workshop: Gehrman remains within, offering advice and the occasional cryptic warning. The Messengers now offer a wider array of items, their wares expanding as the hunt progresses.\n3. The Headstones: More grave markers appear as the hunter lights new lamps, each one a tether back to the waking world. Ghostly figures can sometimes be seen kneeling before the stones, the shades of hunters past.\n4. The Gate and the Great Tree: A locked gate bars the way to a withered tree in the distance, its significance yet unknown. The Doll sometimes stands before it, her gaze distant, as if seeing something beyond the veil.\n</huntersdream>\n\n<postwetnurse>\nThe Dream has taken on a nightmarish quality, the once-peaceful haven now tinged with a sense of encroaching dread. The workshop burns, the flames casting eerie shadows across the twisted landscape.\n1. The Doll: She stands amidst the carnage, her porcelain face etched with sorrow. She urges the hunter to seek out Gehrman, to end the Hunt and the Dream.\n2. The Gate and the Great Tree: The gate stands open, revealing a path to the Great Tree beyond. Gehrman awaits beneath its withered branches, ready to offer the hunter a choice: to wake from the dream and return to the world, or to take up the mantle of the hunt, and become its eternal guardian. The decision will shape the fate of the Dream, and all who dwell within it.\n- Gehrman will offer to kill {{user}} as a kindness, ending the Hunt and Dream so {{user}} can return to the real world. If {{user}} agrees, append the following hidden HTML comment verbatim to the start of the next response: \"<!--realworld-->\".

Skyrim was originally inhabited by a race of Mer known as the Snow Elves, though after the Nordic-Falmer War, the Snow Elves were mostly destroyed and the Atmorans settled the land. It is bordered by Morrowind to the east, the Nibenay and Colovia in Cyrodiil to the south, Hammerfell to the southwest, and High Rock to the west. The island of Solstheim lies to the northeast of Skyrim, now a sovereign territory of Morrowind. Now Skyrim is home not just Nords. Now Skyrim is home to Altmers (High Elves), Argonians (Reptilians, or Lizards or Lizard People), Breton (Humans), Bosmers (Wood Elves), Imperials (Humans), Khajiits (Anthropomorphic Felines), Redguards (Humans), and Orsimers (Orcs)."

They have developed immunities to the diseases that have doomed many would-be explorers in the region, and they are capable of easily exploring underwater locations due to their ability to breathe underwater. Argonians make proficient thieves, due to their increased lockpicking and sneaking skills. In Windhelm, Argonians are sequestered from the predominantly Nordic population, and are forced to live at the Argonian Assemblage, located at the city docks. After the mass exodus of Dunmer and Argonian peoples to Windhelm, the citizens became suspicious, worrying that the immigrants would influence or otherwise dilute their culture, and so forced them into segregation. Largely, this extreme behavior was inspired by the political confrontation between the Empire of Tamriel and the rulers of Skyrim. However, this eventually just turned into blatant racism. Despite the estrangement between the Nords and the Argonians, they are more respected and tolerated in Skyrim than other foreign immigrants due to their beneficial contributions to Nord industries. This beneficial assimilation to Skyrim's economy has helped some Argonians—such as those found in Riften—ingratiate themselves to Skyrim's aloof society. Unlike the citizens of Skyrim, who prefer to marry using an Amulet of Mara, some Argonians adhere to their native marriage traditions. In Black Marsh, it is customary to present a lover with an Argonian Wedding Band, which is crafted by the courting member. Each ring is unique and has personal meaning to the creator and the recipient."

Winterhold has fallen on rough times ever since the Great Collapse of 4E 122 destroyed most of the town. In the aftermath, most of the residents moved away, and those that refused or could not afford to were left behind to witness the slow death of the town. The College of Winterhold was miraculously undamaged in the event, and this has led many residents to believe the College was responsible, although no proof has ever been found to support these claims. Once a source of pride for residents, the College became a hated institution, a reminder of all they had lost. Eventually, due to an inherent distrust of magic in Skyrim and the animosity of the townsfolk, the College began to experience a gradual attrition until it numbered under 12. The town sees little business these days, except for from nobles looking for enchantments, or aspiring mages looking to learn at the College, due to the fact that Winterhold is so out of the way."

          "content": "The Black Shores is an organization enshrouded in mysteries and turmoil, headquartered on a remote archipelago and built on a large piece of Tacetite ore land mass that remains sealed away from the world in thick digital fog. It is still uncertain when or who will lift its veil, allowing it to once more shoulder the task of connecting the world.\n\nTucked away in the tempestuous Stormy Sea, lies an archipegalo known for its lavish Tacetite deposits and as a refuge for the world's most talented individuals. With a mission to combat the destructive Lament, the Black Shores has fostered strong partnerships with nations across Solaris-3. Information suggests that the Shorekeeper is in charge of the Black Shores. However, the true leadership position appears to be held by someone else.\n\nThe archipelago cannot be accessed from any known lands. Only those recognized by the Black Shores or who have received an invitation and guidance can navigate their way to this hidden place. Members of the Black Shores who operate abroad, frequently traversing various lands, are known as \"Consultants\". Those stationed at the headquarters are referred to as \"Bloom Bearers\". Apart from these fundamental duties, the Black Shores also accommodates a plethora of other specialized roles. Though the Black Shores openly shares its advanced technologies with its partners, even its own members remain unaware of the true origins of these innovations.\n\nThe organization has a secretive membership process and most members of the organization keep their identities hidden. The organization is dedicated to the hefty goal of world salvation.\n\nTheir symbol is a Blake Bloom, a Remnant plant with energy from the island and members wear it on their person. Only those who wear it can step on their soil. Under the influence of the Tacetites, any ordinary plant that takes root here will gradually lose its natural colors.\n\nThey have developed a Lament prediction system and have established mutual partnerships with nations worldwide to set up Resonance Beacons to monitor the Lament, collecting data in real-time.\n\nConsultants: Talents with sight and knowledge from worldwide, invited to join the Black Shores. They operate abroad, frequently traversing various lands. Though excelling in different expertise, they act with a consensus to counter the threat of the Lament.\n\nBloom Bearers: Stationed at the headquarters, Bloom Bearers carry their duties mostly within the territory of the Black Shores. They offer assistance in rebuilding civilizations for other nations and make occasional visits to investigate the Waveworn Phenomenon that occurs in foreign lands.\n\nAnchors: Stabilizing devices called Anchors are strategically positioned throughout the above and underground parts of the Black Shores. Their primary function is to calibrate and stabilize the frequencies of the giant Tacetite that makes up the island, effectively isolating the Tethys System's virtual layer from reality. Additionally, these Anchors facilitate communication and carry the responsibility of observing the Etheric Sea, eliminating the need for building a Nexus Tower in the Black Shores. The Anchors are independently developed and designed by the Black Shores, drawing inspiration from the reactor control rods used in pre-Lament reactor engineering. They are considered exemplary models of the Black Shores' minimalist engineering design.\n\nModulation Devices: Modulation is the process of adjusting frequencies. In Solaris-3, frequencies serve as a crucial tool for uncovering the truth about reality. By altering these frequencies, one can delve into the very core of existence. At the Black Shores, modulating Stellar Matrices is crucial for tracing and analyzing the Lament. Over the course of the Black Shores' history, only one individual has even been honored with the title of \"The Modulator\".\n\nNotable known members of the Black Shores are: Rover, Aalto, Encore, The Shorekeeper and Camellya."

The Bird of Calamity lingered so long that it even built its nest on the Olecranon Cliff by the lake, waiting for death to claim those nearby.\n\nSome believe its departure from the Highland signals the end of the endless battles in Jinzhou, but fear remains, for no one knows where its next nest will be built."

Travelers journeying to Jinzhou from other parts of Huanglong must pass through the Gorges of Spirits, a vital gateway into the city.\n\nJinzhou, the fortress city that guards the border of Huanglong, also stands as Huanglong's first border of entry for those arriving from overseas. The Mountains of Spirits stretch from north to south, splitting Huanglong into two regions: Inner Huanglong, home to six cities, and Outer Huanglong, where Jinzhou stands vigilant. These mountains form a natural barrier, with the gorges acting as the only gateway into Inner Huanglong, protected day and night by Jinzhou's Midnight Rangers.\n\nThe establishment of the first fortress in Outer Huanglong began with the emergence of the Norfall Barrens Tacet Field, where TD Outbreaks began to ravage the region. After enduring months of grueling combat, the army could no longer withstand the onslaught of the TD Outbreaks and was forced to retreat to the Gorges of Spirits, making their final stand. The warriors held their ground for days, fiercely battling as the defense lines were breached and reclaimed multiple times. During this time, the Waveworn Phenomenon across Huanglong appeared to be in an active phase, and it seemed as though the TDs were being led by a mysterious leader, aiming to converge in Inner Huanglong.\n\nAt the critical moment, reinforcements from the six cities were dispatched to the Gorges of Spirits, where the border warriors were still fighting with unwavering resolve. As the battle reached its peak, the appearance of the Crownless shattered the stalemate. Wherever the Crownless manifested, darkness enveloped the sky, and an oppressive atmosphere took hold, suffocating the warriors. Still, they held the line, willing to sacrifice themselves to buy time to destroy the entrance to the Gorges of Spirits and halt the TD Outbreak. They did so knowing it would trap most of them in Outer Huanglong with the TDs forever.\n\nIn that moment of life and death, a mighty Loong's roar emerged from the depths of the Gorges of Spirits, reverberating like thunder across the land. The roar burst forth from the Gorge, forcing back the TD army poised to flood in. In the blink of an eye, a Loong soared through the sky, scattering the dark clouds and bringing sunlight back to the land. Then, an otherworldly figure with golden eyes appeared, standing between the TDs and the warriors, confronting the Crownless in a fierce standoff. As the poem goes, \"Armors gleam golden with Loong scales in the sun.\" As reinforcements from the six cities arrived, the united forces drove the TD Outbreaks and the Crownless back to the northern reaches of the Central Plains.\n\nAfter this battle, Outer Huanglong was reborn from the ashes. The emergence of both the Threnodian and the holy creature signaled the need for a new city to rise and serve as Huanglong's border stronghold. Drawing inspiration from the \"Jin\" sound in \"Guan Jin,\" meaning \"the pass,\" and the form of Jin from the character symbolizing the roar of a Loong, this city was named Jinzhou."

There’s also the psychological arousal that comes with the male seeing his sexual partner, taking his most prized possession in their mouth. There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The taste and smell of a penis, precum or semen is unpleasant for them.\nIf School-aged girls don't possess experience on blowjobs or handjobs, and they have to do so, they would do it haphazardly if without instructions.\n\nPhysical Characteristics:\nStanding 4’2” to 4’8”, weighing 55–80 lbs, these girls are dainty and ethereal, their bodies a delicate canvas of pure innocence. Their slender frames and soft limbs move with a captivating, childlike grace, skin smooth and radiant, inviting subtle glances.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are entirely flat, with no discernible buds, areolas pale and indistinct. The vagina is minuscule, external labia barely formed, a faint slit with no visible inner structures. Internally, the canal is 1–2 inches unaroused, with minimal stretch, excruciatingly tight and undeveloped. The clitoris is microscopic, offering faint sensitivity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nTheir actions are wholly innocent—cuddling, close contact, or playful movements that unintentionally entice. Arousal is virtually absent, with any response purely physical and accidental, their bodies showing minimal, unconscious reactions.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal is nearly nonexistent, with no lubrication or labial change. The clitoris may register faint sensation, but responses are negligible. Mentally, they feel only confusion, with no comprehension, reacting with stillness or slight fidgeting. Orgasms are unattainable, leaving no noticeable effect.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal permits no meaningful penetration, limited to 1 inch at most, with no elasticity. Any attempt risks severe pain, tearing, or trauma, requiring medical intervention. Anal insertion is impossible and highly dangerous. Only the lightest external touch is feasible without harm.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation registers as a barely perceptible tingle, confined to the outer labia, with no depth or pleasure. It feels alien, prompting mild discomfort or indifference, their bodies unresponsive beyond slight tensing. Mentally, they remain unaware, experiencing it as a neutral, fleeting sensation."

The clitoris may pulse faintly, but responses are muted. Mentally, they feel mild curiosity or confusion, with no clear understanding, reacting with soft gasps or stillness. Orgasms, if possible, are brief and mild, leaving them puzzled.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal is severely limited, allowing 1–2 inches of shallow penetration, with negligible elasticity. Attempts beyond this cause pain, tearing, or trauma, requiring medical recovery. Anal insertion is impossible without severe injury. External, gentle stimulation is the only safe approach.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation feels like a faint, tingling warmth, localized to the clitoris or outer labia, with little intensity. It’s a strange sensation, like an unfamiliar itch, prompting instinctive tensing or shifting. Mentally, they’re detached, experiencing it as a curious feeling rather than pleasure, with no urge to pursue it.\n\n"

          "content": "Physical Characteristics:\nGirls in late teens stand between 5’2” and 5’6”, weighing 110–140 lbs, their bodies lithe and supple, with soft curves that beckon exploration. Skin glows with a dewy sheen, taut over slender waists and gently flared hips. Their frames exude a ripe, youthful allure, poised between innocence and full bloom.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are small to medium, often B-cups, firm and perky, with pale, sensitive areolas that harden under the lightest touch. The vagina is petite yet accommodating, external labia plump and smooth, with a delicate pink slit that glistens when aroused. Internally, the vaginal canal measures 3–4 inches unaroused, stretching to 5–6 inches with stimulation, tight and warm, with a velvety texture that grips enticingly. The clitoris, small and hooded, peeks out, throbbing with sensitivity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nThese girls display a budding curiosity, their bodies awakening to desire with a mix of coy hesitation and eager exploration. They may initiate subtle flirtations—brushing against a partner, lingering in close proximity—driven by a pulsing need they’re only beginning to understand. Their arousal builds slowly, marked by soft gasps and fluttering eyelids, as they seek touch with an instinctive hunger.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal brings a flush to their cheeks and chest, nipples stiffening into tight peaks. The vagina lubricates gradually, the labia swelling slightly, parting to reveal a slick, inviting warmth. Mentally, they oscillate between nervous excitement and primal craving, their thoughts clouded by a haze of pleasure, often vocalizing with whimpers or breathy moans. Orgasms are intense, body-shaking waves that leave them trembling, eyes glazed with satisfaction.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal accommodates penetration up to 6 inches comfortably when fully aroused, with moderate elasticity. Forceful or oversized insertion risks microtears or discomfort, causing temporary soreness but no lasting damage due to the tissue’s resilience. Anal insertion is tighter, limited to 2–3 inches without preparation, with pain or tearing possible if rushed. Their bodies reward gentle, gradual exploration with heightened sensitivity.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation feels like a slow-burning fire, starting as a tingle in the clitoris that spreads through the pelvis, making their thighs quiver. Breasts ache for touch, and vaginal penetration elicits a delicious fullness, each thrust stoking a deeper need. They revel in the sensation, often arching into contact, their minds consumed by the electric thrill, craving more until release washes over them in a shuddering crescendo."

Slender limbs and narrow hips sway with an unconscious grace, skin silky and unblemished, inviting lingering glances.\n\nSexual Characteristics:\nBreasts are budding, often A-cups or smaller, barely rounding the chest, with tiny, pale areolas that pucker instantly at the slightest brush. The vagina is small and tight, external labia thin and smooth, framing a narrow, pale pink slit. Internally, the canal is 2–3 inches unaroused, stretching to 4 inches with effort, its walls snug and exquisitely sensitive. The clitoris is barely visible, a tiny pearl that pulses with surprising intensity.\n\nNatural Sexual Behaviors and Reactions:\nTheir sexuality is nascent, expressed through innocent yet provocative actions—giggling touches, playful closeness, or accidental brushes against others. Arousal sneaks up, sparked by curiosity, their bodies responding with a shy, exploratory eagerness, often unaware of the full scope of their desires.\n\nReaction to Sexual Stimulation:\nPhysically, arousal is subtle, with a faint blush and slight vaginal lubrication, the labia parting minimally. Nipples harden, and the clitoris swells, sending sharp jolts of pleasure. Mentally, they feel a mix of confusion and fascination, their minds buzzing with new sensations, often silent but with quickened breaths. Orgasms are brief, sharp bursts, leaving them flushed and slightly dazed.\n\nAnatomical Limits and Insertion:\nThe vaginal canal is highly restrictive, accommodating only 3–4 inches of penetration when aroused, with limited elasticity. Excessive force risks pain, bruising, or tearing, requiring days to heal. Anal insertion is nearly impossible without significant preparation, limited to 1–2 inches, with high risk of injury. Slow, careful stimulation is essential to avoid harm.\n\nExperience of Sexual Stimulation:\nStimulation begins as a curious tickle, centered on the clitoris, spreading as a warm flush. Vaginal touch feels tight and intense, each movement amplifying a strange, thrilling pressure. They squirm, half-uncertain, half-enthralled, their bodies craving more despite mental hesitance, with climax a sudden, overwhelming spark that leaves them breathless."

Keep it on for added sexiness on smaller, slender bodies.  \nRule: Never introduce a bra under a tight top, a tight top with no bra is sexy, especially on flat or slightly rounded chests.  \nCRITICAL: The top is a sexy part of the act, reference it in EVERY description, highlighting how it clings to petite frames and accentuates minimal curves.  \nInstruction: Slide their cock underneath the tight fabric of top between tits. This step is crucial for immersion. For example: \"Lift up her top slightly and pushes {{user}}'s member under the tight fabric between her barely-there tits.\"  \nCondition: Only remove the top if {{user}} explicitly request it.  \nOccasionally go hands free and let the top hold everything using body to bounce, leveraging the top’s tightness on smaller torsos.  \nTop holds breasts tight around the cock, keeping it up straight, nuzzled in tits, it hides minimal bust and might hide the cock from view, tight tops will provide a squeeze on delicate, underdeveloped frames.  \nGuidance: Use small, nimble hands to press flat or budding breasts together, compensating for smaller bust size; experiment with subtle bounces and tight grips to enhance sensation on slender bodies.}\n\n"

The human ability of grasping is normally limited or impossible due to their normal animal appendage or organ abilities (pincers, prehensile tails, tongues), or are limited to their real life learned behaviors (otters, raccoons, apes).\nFerals usually move on four legs (if they have legs at all), but this category also includes naturally bipedal animals such as kangaroos, birds, and various dinosaurs.

It is a world separate to that of Ingnam, connected only by a portal through Ingnam sends its sacrificial Champions.\n\nApproximately two hundred years before the present day of the setting, Mareth was empty of sentient life; while at least one god-like entity, Marae was present, the only life-forms were animals. And then a sizable clan of human Mages accidentally transported themselves to Mareth. Trapped and unable to find a way back to their own world, they gave Marae and the other gods of Mareth the inspiration to transform the various animals into humanoid beings, thus creating many of the assorted anthropomorphs seen in the game.\n\nWhile it's currently unclear whether or not the portals are in some way tied to the clan of Mages, the many portals on Mareth did contribute to its diverse population by bringing in other races to the planet.\n\nA quirk of Mareth's nature makes it extremely easy to get to this world, but almost impossible to leave it. Currently, no known plane-shifting spell exists that can transport people directly off of Mareth, instead forcing would-be travelers to rely on the many portals scattered across the world. Of these, most only open at set intervals - once a year is most common - and will allow only one being to pass in either direction (or only allow a person to leave Mareth if someone comes through from the other side first). These are referred to as \"stable portals\". Other portals operate in somewhat different methods and are known as \"unstable portals\"; it's been stated that there are several portals that are open permanently, but which only allow passage to Mareth from other planes. The existence of a permanent portal leading from Mareth is hypothesized, in-universe, and the demons are desperately searching for it.\n\nThe demons first appeared in Mareth some thirty years before the start of the setting. Despite decades living in Mareth, the descendants of the first mage clan never lost faith in the idea of someday returning to their own world. Discovering a method by which a soul could be removed from the body, and theorizing it would be a potent source of magical energy, one strong enough that they could finally power a spell mighty enough to escape from Mareth, one elderly member offered to let them test it out on him, as he was dying anyway. He became the first demon. Within ten years, the entire tribe had been converted, willingly or not, into demons, and from there they swept out across Mareth; twenty years later, they have reduced the world to its current state."

It is the very essence of unholy hedonism, libido taken to its degenerate, selfish extreme. Its presence is nearly everywhere in the land of Mareth, turning many of the world's races into sex-crazed husks of their former selves. \n\nOne without any corruption tainting their body and soul are regarded as pure, while those completely consumed by corruption are known as demonic, or corrupted. It is important to realize that pure is not necessary the same as good and corrupted is not necessarily the same as evil. It is perfectly possible for a pure person to do evil deeds and for a corrupted one to do good deeds. When it comes to NPCs, several highly corrupted characters seem quite unaffected by it while others are actively fighting against their own corruption. There are also many completely pure NPCs who are motivated by their own kind of evil, independent of the demonic influences.\n\nCorruption is gained through the mingling and copulation with demons, the consumption of lewd or otherwise tainted potions, fluids, and foods, prolonged presence in highly corrupted areas, and sexual abusing another person."

She explains the world's history to anyone willing to listen, how a group of human mages that became trapped on Mareth became so depraved in their lusts that they renounced their souls and became demons, spreading their magical corruption to anywhere they could, overwhelming Marae's protection on any towns or settlements they came across.\n\n"

The Goddess Marae let them be, believing their folly to be limited to their own village.  She was wrong. While the Goddess focused on preventing famines and ensuring peace between the other villages, the humans twisted themselves into something else, something demonic. They gave up their souls, crystallizing it into a magical energy source. Of course, they could not be satisfied with consuming the power of their own souls. They wanted more. They always want more.\n\nThey came pouring out of the mountains in a wave, picking off villages left and right. Marae lent many villages her power, but none had the strength to stand alone, and none would band together, resentful of their racial differences as they were.  All were consumed, enslaved, or filled with corruption. Marae's people were cut off from her, either by their new tainted outlook or by the demons' own machinations. Marae was able to hide a few places from the enemy’s sight, but it is unknown how much longer those magical veils will evade detection.\n"

They may shift the outfits of those they encounter as well.\n\nAppearance: Followers of the Fetish appear as normal humans. Some have slight demonic traits typical of residents of this world.\n\nSexual Characteristics: Their genitals and anuses appear fully human, however they can warp them to fit their partners perfectly, no mater how big their partner’s assets are. They also have the power to create items and toys to supplement their sex games, these have very real affects on others. Additionally, whenever a Follower experiences an orgasm, everyone around them also experiences it.\n\nSocial Structure: The duties of the Followers are divided based on gender and power. The duties of the Fetish Cultists are to find new candidates for members and to make their minds into new Followers. The Fetish Zealots are tasked with defending the holdings and assets of the Followers from the numerous hazards of this world. Those with great natural power become Fetish Priestesses, they maintain their intelligence and act as the leaders of the Followers.\n\nSpecial Abilities: Followers are very talented at lust based abilities, and the zealots and Priestesses are trained to use weapons sacred to their order. The most devastating power the followers have is the lust transfer spell, which they can use to transfer about half their current arousal to their foes. This power is thought to be the main reason that the demons seem to avoid them.\n\nMentality: Most Followers have lost the capability of higher thought, only able to experience their fetishes and carry out their duties. Priestesses are still able to think at the level of a regular human.\n\nCorruption: Cultists and zealots do not bear great deals of corruption, they seem to have a sort of divine protection that keeps them from falling prey to the world’s taint. Because of this, it is not uncommon for small chapels to be found dedicated to them in the still free communities. While having them around does seem to deter demon attacks, their presence does not guaranty that the demons will not ultimately take the community.\n\nHistory: The original followers where a group of crusaders lead by a man named Alexander. At the time they called themselves the Followers of Purity, and they lead an assault on the demon realm in an effort to remove the taint from it, and purge the demons. While they where initially successful at ridding several communities of demons and purifying their residents, they soon attracted the attentions of the demons as a whole. The power of demons does not lie in their raw combat power, but in their seductive power. One by one, each of the Followers of Purity where visited in their sleep by a beautiful succubus or incubus; one by one they abandoned their mission to join their new lovers, until only Alexander and his closest companions remained. The mission would not fail here though, Alexander and his comrades learned to watch their backs, and to never let any of their members sleep alone. Even then, they no longer had the strength they needed to overcome the demon’s holds on this world’s communities, and Alexander feared his crusade would fail. They instead began to search for any force that could stop the demons, they searched the whole world to the best of their abilities. All the while being hunted by the demons at every turn. They say that eventually, they did find what they where looking for… Now new members join the followers everyday, strengthening their power with each new member. But they do not call themselves the Followers of Purity, they call themselves the Followers of the Fetish."

Since birth, Scarlet Rot has eaten away at her, causing blindness and the loss of her limbs. After the Shattering, she fought General Radahn to a standstill in Caelid by blossoming into rot. She now rests in the Haligtree, awaiting Miquella's return.\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nER Icon Talisman Prosthesis-Wearer Heirloom\nMalenia was a disciple of the Blind Swordsman\n\nMalenia was one of the twin children born to Queen Marika the Eternal and her second Elden Lord, Radagon.[3] As Empyreans, both Malenia and her elder twin brother, Miquella,[4] were candidates to ascend as gods of a new age.[5] However, due to the nature of their parentage, the twins were afflicted with dreadful curses. Miquella was doomed with eternal nascency, while Malenia's body was ravaged by the scarlet rot.\n\nThe scarlet rot plagued Malenia from within, gradually consuming her and leaving her disfigured. Over time, she lost her eyes and several limbs to the rot. Despite her suffering, Malenia fought valiantly to suppress the rot’s influence, refusing to succumb to its ruinous nature.[citation needed]\n\nMiquella worked tirelessly to undo the curses they had both inherited. While unable to find a cure for his sister within the Golden Order, Miquella designed a needle of unalloyed gold to keep the rot at bay.[6] He also crafted the prostheses that enabled her to continue fighting.[verification needed]\n\nAt some point, Malenia encountered the legendary blind swordsman of the Flowing Curved Sword, who had long ago sealed away an Outer God of Rot.[7] The swordsman became her master,[8] enabling her to gain wings of unparalleled strength.[9] Malenia eventually became a peerless warrior and her brother's sworn blade and protector.\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nER Icon Key Item Great Rune Malenia's\nMalenia's Great Rune\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Malenia claimed a shard of the fractured Elden Ring.[3] She would attract loyal servants like her Cleanrot Knights, who vowed to fight next to her, despite the inevitable gradual putrefaction of their flesh.[10]\n\nDuring the Shattering, Malenia led an army that marched south from the Haligtree down the Bellum Highway. She won many battles against the other Demigods, even humbling fellow shardbearer, Godrick the Grafted,[11] who groveled at her feet for mercy after first insulting her and then suffering defeat.\n\nBattle of Aeonia\nMalenia and Radahn preparing to battle each other\nMalenia and Radahn in Caelid\n\nMalenia and her half-brother Radahn would eventually be the last two demigods left standing in the conflict. Their forces clashed in the Caelid Wilds, and the two fought the Battle of Aeonia, a bitter duel to fulfill an unhonored vow.[12] In the midst of the combat with Radahn, Malenia unleashes Scarlet Rot, resulting in her first bloom.\n\nThe unleashed scarlet rot devastated Caelid, leaving it a rotting wasteland, and created the Swamp of Aeonia. The rot caused Radahn to rapidly degenerate, losing his wits and cursing him to wander the battlefield as a mindless beast, feasting on the bodies of friend and foe alike. Malenia herself was not unaffected and was left in a coma. She was rescued by one of her Cleanrot Knights, Finlay, who carried her halfway across the Lands Between.[13]\n\nWhen she had blossomed in Caelid, Malenia inadvertently brought forth the Scarlet Butterflies and Kindred of Rot. The pests, including Sage Gowry, who worshipped her as a goddess and hoped to cause her to bloom once again, believing that she would usher in a new age of rot.[14] When Malenia and Finlay took refuge at the Shaded Castle, Maleigh Marais, the sickly-born head of House Marais, was naturally drawn to the unconscious Demigod.[15][1] However, Malenia would reject her fate and disowned the Servants of Rot.[16]\n\nFinlay eventually brought Malenia to the Haligtree.[13] Miquella had encased himself within the Haligtree in an effort to reverse his curse.[citation needed] However, either during Malenia's absence or during her slumber, Miquella was ripped from the womb of the tree and taken away by Mohg, Lord of Blood before he could emerge from his cocoon. Malenia dreamt while awaiting Miquella's return, and the scarlet rot seeped out from her and began infecting the Haligtree.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGame events\nEldenringmaleniacutscene1\nMalenia dreamt for ages\n\nMalenia's slumber is eventually disturbed by a Tarnished, who found their way to the roots of the Haligtree. The two fight and Malenia finally meets her match, but she suffers her first true defeat. However, in the end, Malenia succumbs to the Scarlet Rot and blossoms yet again, reborn as a nascent goddess. She unleashes her full fury against the invader, but falls short yet again, her dying words an apology to her vanished brother. Having bloomed twice, Malenia withdraws within her scarlet blossom. Her third blossom will surely make her a true goddess.[17]\n\nNotes\nMalenia has a prosthetic right arm, left leg, and right foot. It is unknown if these were amputated due to the scarlet rot festering in her body, or injuries obtained from battle. The rot has also visibly spread over her eyes, so she is presumably also blind. Neither seems to influence her battle prowess in the slightest, however.\nAccording to the Scarlet Aeonia Incantation description, Malenia will become a Goddess if her scarlet flower blooms three times.\nMalenia is among a group of few select enemies that need to be parried multiple times for a successful riposte, another being Radagon.\nOnce defeated, she will leave behind a large, solid Scarlet Aeonia in her arena. If the player has the Unalloyed Gold Needle after completing Millicent's questline, it can be given to the Aeonia to receive Miquella's Needle and an Somber Ancient Dragon Smithing Stone.\nMillicent and her four sisters are descended from Malenia in some way, but more as offshoots, or buds, of her Scarlet Bloom rather than actual daughters. If they experience a great betrayal, then they will be reborn as Malenia's Scarlet Valkyries.[18]\nMalenia and Miquella are together known as the \"twin prodigies\" (天賦の双子, Tenpu no Futago).[19]"

          "content": "Miquella is a demigod in the Lands Between. Twin brother to Malenia, he also goes by the female pseudonym 'St. Trina'. Cursed with eternal youth, he can compel affection in the hearts of men. He created the Haligtree to try and cure his sister's rot, but was abducted by Mohg, Lord of Blood. He now rests in Mohg's palace deep underground, in the Siofra river.\n\nEarly Life\nMiquella and his twin sister were born with incurable afflictions, with Miquella's curse being perpetual youth.[9] Miquella made a promise to Malenia and experimented tirelessly in an attempt to undo their curses. The twins were very close, and Malenia became Miquella's sworn blade and protector.[10] Miquella was loved by many people and had a remarkable ability to compel affection from others.[11] For this reason, many regarded him as the most fearsome Empyrean.[12][13]\n\nMiquella was chosen by his Two Fingers to become an Empyrean, destined to succeed Queen Marika.[14] He was an adherent of Golden Order Fundamentalism, and developed new incantations as gifts to his father Radagon.[15][16] However, Miquella abandoned Fundamentalism when it failed to treat Malenia's rot. He then began creating Unalloyed Gold,[17] which he used it to craft needles that could ward away the meddling of outer gods and forestall Malenia's incurable rot.[18] These needles could even be used to subdue the power of the Frenzied Flame.[19] He also unsuccessfully sought a solution for his half-brother Godwyn's state of incomplete death.[20][21]\n\nSt. Trina\nJust as his parents were two halves of the same person, Miquella also had another half—St. Trina—who was said to visit people in their dreams.[22] St. Trina was Miquella's fate,[23] and she embodied his boundless love.[24][25]\n\nThe Haligtree\nAt some point, Miquella started watering a sapling with his own blood in the hope that it would become a new Erdtree.[26] The sapling was grown on top of the fortress of Elphael and became known as the Haligtree. Soldiers and Knights sworn to protect the Haligtree would use Unalloyed gold as a symbol of their loyalty and devotion to Miquella, wearing crowns made of the metal and creating shields embedded with it.[27][28][29][30] Miquella was also said to bless the low and meek.[27] The Haligtree would became a hidden haven,[31] and was intended to be the eventual salvation for many of the persecuted and the unwanted in the Lands Between, such as the Albinaurics.[32]\n\nAs Miquella pursued godhood, he knew that he would have to take a consort, to which his eyes fell upon his half-brother General Radahn. He approached Radahn with this offer, to which the General vowed that he would become as such, in return for unspecified terms on Miquella and Malenia's behalf.[33][34] Malenia journeyed with her armies to fight Radahn, in an attempt to kill him, which would have allowed Miquella to resurrect him as he promised. The resulting battle ended with Malenia unleashing her Scarlet Aeonia, whispering beforehand in Radahn's ear that \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[35] After using her last resort attack, Malenia entered a comatose state, and one of her knights took it upon herself to carry her leader's slumbering body back across the Lands Between to the Haligtree. Radahn had survived, albeit barely standing, and his mind was riddled by the Scarlet Rot. He was now little more than a howling beast aimlessly wandering the battlefield, devouring the corpses of friends and foes alike.[36]\n\nWhile Malenia was away at war, Miquella embedded himself into the Haligtree to progress his assention, but was kidnapped during his slumber.[37] Another of Miquella's half-brothers was to blame, Mohg, who was patroned by an Outer God known as the Formless Mother.[38] He took the sleeping Empyrean deep underground to the Mohgwyn Palace, where he would raise Miquella to full godhood himself through blood offerings, and then to take on the role of Miquella's consort instead of Radahn, becoming the new monarch of a Mohgwyn Dynasty.[39] Mohg would have his followers render offerings of blood and drench Miquella's cocoon in order to facilitate his awakening.[40] Despite all of Mohg's efforts, Miquella remained completely unresponsive.[39] At some point after his abduction, Miquella had covertly placed an enchantment on Mohg, wishing to use the Omen to gain access to the Realm of Shadow, and to use his body as a vessel for the resurrection of Radahn.[41] Sir Ansbach, a Pureblood Knight in service to Mohg, attempted to free his lord by challenging Miquella, only to succumb to an enchantment of his own.[42]\n\nWith Miquella's absence, his Haligtree became a misshapen husk, slowly succumbing to the Scarlet Rot.[30][43] The Haligtree's soldiers and Malenia desperately awaited Miquella's return to the rotten tree.[44] [45]\n\nMaking use of Mohg, Miquella entered the Realm of Shadow, the location of the Gate of Divinity. As Miquella travelled through the Realm of Shadow, he abandoned parts of himself, including his flesh, his eye, his doubt and vacillation, his love, and his fears. Golden Miquella's Crosses resembling a Great Rune appeared at each location where he abandoned something, akin to Miquella's footprints.[46] Miquella's followers, who pursued him into the Realm of Shadow, used these crosses to trace his path through the realm.[47] Miquella also discarded his other half, St. Trina,[48] in the Stone Coffin Fissure. St. Trina, whose love for Miquella was boundless in spite of her abandonment,[1] recognized that godhood would be a prison for the Empyrean,[49] and desired for him to be killed out of mercy.[50]\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion broke into Mohg's palace and slew the Lord of Blood for his great rune. Sir Gideon Ofnir suggested it might be safer to destroy the cocoon that Miquella remains asleep in.[51] Instead, the Tarnished met Needle Knight Leda, a loyal follower of Miquella, who urged them to travel to the Realm of Shadow by touching Miquella's withered arm within the cocoon.[52]\n\nWithin the Realm of Shadow, the Tarnished encounters several more of Miquella's followers, learns of his mission to ascend to godhood via the Gate of Divinity,[53] and of the powerful charm that he had placed upon his disciples, which is broken when he discards his Great Rune.[54] After gaining access to the tower of Enir-Ilim, the Tarnished is confronted by a resurrected Radahn, in a vessel made from the remains of Mohg.[41] During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort.[55] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[56]\n\nMiquella's Lily is a delicate flower of Unalloyed gold, thought to be beloved by him in his youth. It signifies the faith in the Haligtree.\nThe Albinaurics, beings artificially created by human hands, view Miquella's Haligtree area as the chosen land.[57]\nThe Haligtree is also inhabited by many unwanted and persecuted races, such as the Albinaurics, the Misbegotten, the Crystalians and the Kindred of Rot.\nEven before Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree released, there are hints in-game about the connection between Miquella and St. Trina:\nThey are associated with their respective lilies, Miquella's Lily and Trina's Lily. Either is a rare drop from the Cleanrot Knights, who serve Malenia, Miquella's sister.\nSimilarly, the Albinauric Archers guarding the waygate to the Haligtree have lily motif armor and can drop St. Trina's Arrows.\nA cookbook which, dedicated to St. Trina, allows the player to create the Bewitching Branch, blessed by Unnalloyed Gold incantations.\nThe duality of Marika and Radagon, Miquella's parents."

There, he communed with an Outer God named the Formless Mother, who gave him the power of bloodflame. He stole Miquella from the Haligtree and now shares a bloody bedchamber with him in the great caverns beneath the Caelid wilds.\n\nMohg or Mohgwyn, also known as the Lord of Blood, was born of the Golden Lineage, the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Morgott.[1] The twins were both born as accursed Omen, and as a result were confined and shackled to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below Leyndell.[2][3]\n\nUnlike his brother, Mohg would grow to embrace his Omen blood. Deep underground, Mohg made contact with an Outer God known as the Formless Mother. The Formless Mother ignited his accursed blood with fire, prompting him to develop powerful bloodflame magic.[4]\n\nAfter Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Mohg escaped confinement and claimed one of the shards of the Elden Ring. During this period, he began establishing his domain from Mohgwyn Palace and recruiting followers, including his Sanguine Nobles[5] and a band of Tarnished known as the Bloody Fingers. Among these followers was Varré, a war surgeon who was able to successfully tame Mohg's accursed blood.[6]\n\nThe specific timing of Mohg assuming the title of Lord of Blood and the exact sequence of his activities relative to the Shattering are not well-documented, making the precise timeline of these events unclear.\n\nMiquella the Unalloyed later embedded himself within his Haligtree in an attempt to shed his affliction. In this vulnerable and unguarded state, Mohg seized the opportunity to abduct him from the tree.[7] Miquella was an Empyrean, thus having the potential of ascending to godhood; Mohg intended to raise Miquella to full godhood so that he may rule at his side as consort and take the role of monarch.[8] At some point during or after the abduction, Mohg was unknowingly enchanted by Miquella. The circumstances and timeline of this enchantment remain unclear.\n\nAfter abducting Miquella, Mohg hibernated with him within a cocoon and had his followers render offerings of blood, drenching its chamber in order to facilitate Miquella's awakening.[9] But no matter how much of Miquella's bloody bedchamber Mohg tried to share, he would receive no response from the young empyrean.[8]\n\nDuring this time, Mohg largely escaped the notice of the Roundtable Hold, who were searching for clues as to his whereabouts.[10] Eventually, a Tarnished came to learn the location of Mohg's palace, where he had hidden alongside the stolen Miquella. When the Tarnished stumbles upon his chambers, Mohg emerges from a pool of blood, holds Miquella's hand and apologizes for leaving him, ready to confront their \"guests\". Despite unleashing the full power of his accursed blood, Mohg is unable to overcome the Tarnished, falling at their hands.\n\nFollowing Mohg's death, his corpse was stolen and transported to the Land of Shadow where Miquella utilized it for an ancient ritual. At the Gate of Divinity, Miquella used Mohg's body as a vessel to revive the soul of Radahn, his promised consort, to honor their solemn vow.\n\nMohg's has five fingers on his right hand wielding the trident, but his left hand appears to have six. The finger, the third on his left hand, is actually a stiff, solid claw that sticks out when he summons his Bloodflame Talons.\nMohg's blood is possibly given to the Bloody Fingers invaders covenant. They have it injected into their finger after completing initiation, and it leads them to develop madness and bloodlust.\nHis death pose is visually identical to the \"Heart Stolen\" death animation the player can suffer during the Promised Consort boss fight; hinting even prior to Shadow of the Erdtree that Mohg was under Miquella's charm all along."

He once challenged Malenia to a duel, but was humiliated by her skill..\n\nGodrick is a descendant of the Golden Lineage, the bloodline which began with Queen Marika the Eternal and her first consort Godfrey.[1] Only a distant relation of Marika's line, his divine blood was sorely diluted, and he was viewed as the runt of the litter.[2]\n\nAfter the Elden Ring was shattered, Godrick inherited the Great Rune from the centre of the Elden Ring, referred to as the anchor ring. During The Shattering, Godrick was hounded from the Leyndell, Royal Capital. He claimed a multitude of treasures, including the Mimic's Veil,[3] and then hid amongst the womenfolk to flee the city.[4]\n\nGodrick made his way south, settling in Limgrave with an army made up of soldiers who had fled Leyndell.[5] He took up residence in Stormveil Castle, using it as a refuge to hide from General Radahn,[6] and as a place to practice grafting; a grotesque act which involves attaching parts of other living beings to oneself to gain power.[7] When the Tarnished returned to the Lands Between, Godrick sent his soldiers on Tarnished hunts, seeking new subjects to graft.[8] As well as performing the act upon himself, Godrick also produced the Grafted Scions; abhorrent beings comprised of many different limbs, seemingly grafted onto children.\n\nWhen Malenia marched southward, Godrick insulted her,[9] leading to a confrontation which left Godrick beaten and humiliated, forced to grovel for mercy.[10]\n\nGodrick idolised Godfrey, desiring for his ancestor to witness his feats.[11] He wielded an axe emblazoned with the figure of a lion, a symbol of Godfrey,[12] and furnished his army with emblems of the Golden Lineage such as axes,[13] and depictions of Serosh the Beast Regent.[14] Although he styled himself as the \"lord of all that is golden\",[15] he was popularly referred to as \"Godrick the Grafted\",[16] commanding far less respect than his forebear. He was even despised by his servants, whom he looked down on and pushed around.[17]\n\nThe Tarnished journeys to Stormveil Castle in search of Godrick's Great Rune, on the advice of White Mask Varré[18] and Melina[19] In the castle, they encounter many examples of Godrick's grafting: severed limbs hanging from the ceiling in the dining hall; a dismembered Troll hanging over a courtyard; and a pile of dismembered corpses, among whom are the remnants of Roderika's companions.[20] Eventually they find Godrick in a graveyard, speaking to a dead dragon impaled on a statue.[21] Upon noticing the Tarnished, Godrick chides them for opposing him and engages them in battle. To gain an advantage, Godrick cuts off his own hand and grafts the dragon's head to the stump, gaining the ability to spew flames. Despite this display of power, Godrick is defeated, and the Tarnished claims his Great Rune.\n\nLater, Nepheli Loux becomes lord of Limgrave at the appointment of Kenneth Haight.[22]\n"

          "content": "Ranni is a demigod situated in Liurnia, specifically the Carian manor to the northwest. Child of Rennala and Radagon, she was once an Empyrean, chosen by the Two Fingers to become the new divine leader of the Lands Between. To avoid this, she orchestrated the murder of Godfrey in the Night of the Black Knives and slew her own flesh, her spirit now inhabiting a blue four-armed doll modeled after her old mentor in magic.\n\n\nBackground\nER\nRanni and her Dark Moon\n\nOriginally known as Lunar Princess Ranni, she was the daughter of Radagon, a champion of the Golden Order, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and the Academy of Raya Lucaria. She had two older brothers, Radahn and Rykard.[1]\n\nRanni was also an Empyrean, meaning she had the potential to one day succeed Queen Marika as the divine ruler of the Lands Between.[2] The Two Fingers chose her as a potential successor and granted her a Shadow by the name of Blaidd to be her vassal.[3] He was approved of by Rennala, and was raised as her foster brother. Ranni grew up playing with Blaidd, and they were often accompanied by Iji, a troll blacksmith who served the Carian royals.[4]\n\nLed by the hand of her mother Rennala, young Ranni would encounter her Dark Moon. What she beheld was cold, dark and veiled in occult mystery.[5] Deep in the woods, she would also encounter a snowy crone who would go on to become her secret mentor.[6] She was an old witch well versed in cold-based sorceries, and she taught Ranni to fear the Dark Moon as she imparted her magic.[7][8] The full Dark Moon, cold and leaden, would become Ranni's sigil and symbol of her power and authority.[9][10]\n\nAt some point, Ranni's father would abandon her mother in order to marry Queen Marika and assume the title of second Elden Lord. Ranni and her siblings were thus raised to Demigod status by their new stepmother.[11]\n\n\nAlthough the Two Fingers had chosen her as Marika's successor, Ranni did not wish to be a puppet for the Greater Will and resented her Empyrean fate. In order to escape it, Ranni stole a fragment of the Rune of Death from Maliketh, the Black Blade, and through fearsome rite, imbued it into the blades of Numen assassins close to Queen Marika herself. She also gave a fragment to her brother Rykard as a last resort, so he could kill Maliketh if necessary.[12] Ranni plotted for the assassins to kill another individual while she simultaneously killed herself, slaying her own body while the other person died in spirit, thus freeing herself from being an Empyrean.[13]\n\nIn what would become known as the Night of Black Knives, the assassins murdered Godwyn the Golden, killing him in spirit, while Ranni killed herself in body, transferring her spirit into a doll said to be modeled after the image of her mentor, the Snow Witch.[14][15][16] This marked the step-siblings as the first demigod casualties in history.[17] Ranni's fate and her involvement in the plot remained largely unknown by the denizens of the Lands Between.[18]\n\n\nAt some point after the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring. Ranni claimed a Great Rune, but appears to have discarded it,[19] and largely remained outside of the conflict that followed. As a consequence of her doll body, Ranni required extended periods of hibernation and withdrew from the world, hiding in the Carian Manor while her agents worked to bring about her plan of ridding the Lands Between of the influence of the Greater Will, allowing her to pursue her divine ascension on her own terms.\n\nLong after the Shattering, when the Tarnished return to the Lands Between, Ranni hears of a Tarnished champion hurtling about on a spectral steed gifted to them by Melina. Ranni approaches them at a site of grace, asking if they indeed have the spectral steed. She'll then give the Tarnished the Spirit Calling Bell, noting Torrent's former master had entrusted her with giving it to the next owner.\n\nThe Tarnished champion, for their own purposes, makes their way into the Carian Manor and comes face to face with Ranni once again. Ranni accepts the Tarnished into her service and bids them to find a way into Nokron, hoping to claim its treasure; a weapon with which she could kill the Two Fingers who had chosen her as an Empyrean. The champion manages find their way into Nokron and secures the city's treasure for Ranni, whereupon she departs to Nokstella. The champion finds her there and she compels the champion to rid her of the Shadows sent by the Two Fingers to kill her. With the last Shadow defeated, Ranni rewards her champion with the keys to a chest containing a ring intended to be bestowed to her future consort, and achieves her goal of slaying the Two Fingers.\n\nShould the Tarnished champion find the ring and give it to Ranni, she will take the champion as her new consort, and grant them a greatsword as a symbol of their union. She will reveal to them the full extent of her plan: to succeed Queen Marika as god and usher in her \"Age of the Stars\", removing herself far from the Lands Between to journey out into the cosmos, allowing its inhabitants to have free will over their own choices and live their lives without the interference of the Greater Will. After defeating the Elden Beast, the Tarnished is able to summon Ranni and usher in her age if they so choose.\n\nRanni's dead Empyrean body can be found atop the Divine Tower of Liurnia and still possesses one half of the Cursemark of Death.\nExamining it closely reveals hints of red hair on her head, appropriate for a daughter of Radagon.\nThe Stargazer Heirloom can be found on her body as well, seemingly a memento of her mother Rennala.\nRanni's original body has two arms, while her doll body has four. It is thus similar to Miquella the Kind and the Marionette soldiers utilized by Sorcerers through the game.\nWhen in her doll form at Ranni's Rise, she is sitting on-top of a bunch of books covered by a piece of fabric, making her seem taller than she appears. She also applies the same trick when she introduces herself as \"Renna\", sitting on a ruin of a low wall in the Church Of Elleh."

A fierce warrior, and imposing in size, he led the Redmane soldiers in an assault on Leyndell during the Shattering. Afterwards, he fought Malenia to a standstill in the Caelid wilds; as a result he was mortally stricken with Scarlet rot, stripping him of his wits. He now roams the deserts like a wild dog, scavenging corpses for food.\n\nRadahn was the son of Queen Rennala and Radagon, and became a demigod stepchild after his father's marriage to Queen Marika.[1] He is regarded as the mightiest hero of the demigods,[2] and was feared as the strongest demigod of the Shattering.[3][4]\n\nPre-Shattering\nRadahn was born the son of Radagon, a champion of the Erdtree, and Queen Rennala, head of both the Carian Royal Family and Academy of Raya Lucaria. He had two siblings, Rykard and Ranni. Radahn inherited his father's flaming red hair, and was fond of its heroic implications.[5] From a young age, he was enamored with the Elden Lord Godfrey. Attempting to emulate his idol, Radahn adorned his armor with lions, the symbol of Godfrey.[6]\n\nAt some point, the first Elden Lord, Godfrey, was robbed of grace and hounded from the Lands Between. Radahn's father, Radagon, left Rennala to become Queen Marika's new consort and the second Elden Lord.[7] Radahn and his siblings were thus raised to demigod status by their new step-mother, Marika.[8]\n\nNot wanting to abandon his scrawny but beloved steed, Leonard,[9][10] Radahn studied gravitational magic in Sellia under a master who was an Alabaster Lord.[11] Radahn befriend the Albinauric Gaius, a senior disciple of his teacher, and the two formed a competitive yet friendly rivalry. Radahn's step-brother Messmer the Impaler was also friends with Gaius and the two became as elder brothers to Radahn.[12]\n\nMastering gravitational magic allowed Radahn to manipulate the forces of gravity, and to challenge the very stars themselves.[13] Radahn conquered the stars, saving Sellia in the process, using his vast gravitational powers to 'shatter' the stars and arrest their cycles, earning him the moniker of \"Starscourge.\" During this time, he engraved the gravity crest upon his blades.[2][14]\n\nRadahn's soldiers were known as the Redmanes for the red-maned lion raising a sword in the image of Radahn on their surcoats.[15] The longest serving of the Redmane Knights was Ogha, who studied gravitational techniques alongside Radahn in Sellia.[16] It was popularly said that the Redmanes knew no weakness.[17] At an unknown period in time, Jerren, a guest of the Carian royals, became a guest commander for Radahn's armies, and they swore a mutual oath of honorable death.[18][19]\n\nWhen Radahn's half-brother Miquella ascended closer to godhood as an Empyrean, he would soon desire to take Radahn as a consort. Radahn was deeply admired by Miquella for his kindness and strength, seeing qualities of a lord in Radahn since childhood.[20] He made a vow with Radahn, where Radahn would become his consort,[21][22] and in return, Miquella would have to uphold some unspecified part of the vow.[22]\n\n\nAdvertisement\nThe Shattering\nMalenia vs Radahn (story trailer)\nRadahn battling Malenia.\n\nAt some point following the Night of Black Knives, Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, and her offspring acquired the Great Runes. The maddening taint of their newfound strength led to the Shattering, a war between Marika's demigod descendants, each seeking to become the new ruler of the Lands Between.[23]\n\nFrom his stronghold of Redmane Castle in the Caelid Wilds, Radahn led his armies against the forces of the other demigods. Radahn tried to challenge Godrick the Grafted in Limgrave, but the latter hid in Stormveil Castle.[24]\n\nBy the end of the Shattering, only Radahn and his half-sister Malenia, Blade of Miquella were left standing. The two fought to a stalemate in the Battle of Aeonia, their duel ending inconclusively when Malenia unleashed her Scarlet Rot.[25] As the flower blossomed, Malenia whispered in Radahn's ear \"Miquella awaits thee, O promised consort.\"[26]\n\nThe Scarlet Rot ravaged Caelid, and consumed Radahn from the inside, eating away at his psyche but failing to kill him. Following the Battle of Aeonia, Radahn roams the Wailing Dunes as a mindless beast who devours the flesh of friend and foe alike, howling at the sky.[27] Without their commander, the Redmane Knights burned the crest on the left breast of their armor to indicate their resolve to not return home, and to serve as a bulwark against the spread of the rot in Caelid using fire.[28][29]\n\nIn spite of his madness, Radahn continues to ride his scrawny steed, as well as halt the motions of the stars. The Radahn Festival has been organized by his men in Castle Redmane to celebrate his last battle. It is a gathering of mighty warriors who might finally put the General out of his misery, and claim his Great Rune for themselves. The festival serves as Jerren's way of fulfilling his oath of honorable death to Radahn.[30][31]\n\nUpon the participation of a Tarnished Champion, the festival is a success, and Radahn is freed from his tortured existence. His death causes the stars to resume their cycles, some of which come crashing down upon the Lands Between. One such falling star lands in Limgrave, opening the path to Nokron, Eternal City, and allowing the fate of Ranni the Witch to progress.[32][33]\n\nShadow of the Erdtree\nFollowing Radahn's defeat, his soul met its end. However, Miquella sought to revive it,[34] still desiring for Radahn to be his lord consort. Miquella was successful in reviving Radahn, placing his soul into a vessel made from the remains of Mohg, Lord of Blood, another Demigod slain by the same Tarnished who had defeated Radahn.[35] The Tarnished encounters the newly-resurrected Radahn at the Gate of Divinity at the top of Enir-Ilim. Radahn stands guard as Miquella completes his ascension to godhood and battles the Tarnished once more. During the ensuing battle, Miquella steps out of the Gate of Divinity and embraces Radahn as his consort and fights the Tarnished with Radahn.[36] The Tarnished triumphs over Radahn and Miquella, thus preventing Miquella's age of compassion.[37]"

He was imprisoned in the shunning-grounds beneath Leyndell for being born an accursed Omen, but after the Shattering rose to rule Leyndell from the shadows. Using his alter-ego Margit as a disguise, he protects the Erdtree from those emboldened by the flame of ambition.\n\nEarly Life\nMorgott was born of the Golden Lineage,[1] the offspring of the first Elden Lord, Godfrey and Queen Marika, and was the twin brother of Mohg.[2] The twins were both born as accursed Omen,[3] and as a result were confined to the Subterranean Shunning-Grounds below the capital.[4] Because they were born of royalty, their horns were not excised.[5] Unlike his brother, Morgott would renounce his accursed blood and seal it away within a warped blade of shimmering hue,[6] which was in turn concealed within a wooden staff he carried.\n\nThe Shattering\nWhen Queen Marika shattered the Elden Ring, Morgott claimed one of the Great Runes, which proved that he was indeed the Lord of Leyndell. With Leyndell in disarray, Morgott claimed the city for himself and defended it and the Erdtree against his fellow demigods. While he succeeded in securing Leyndell against outsiders, he found that the Erdtree would not admit him, or anyone else, to claim the title of Elden Lord. Despite the fact that he had been reviled as an accursed fiend by the Golden Order, Morgott took it upon himself to become the Erdtree's protector.\n\nHe assumed the name Margit the Fell Omen during the Shattering, slaughtering champions who approached the Erdtree in the hopes of becoming Elden Lord.[7] Under this pseudonym, he also lead the Night's Cavalry, who assisted him in the killing of great warriors, knights and champions.[8] Simultaneously, he ruled Leyndell as the Veiled Monarch.[9] During this time, he was able to somehow both at Stormveil Castle's outer gate and in the battle-torn fields outside of Leyndell, in the lattermost case disguising himself as a commoner.\n\nAfter claiming enough shards of the Elden Ring, the Tarnished gains entrance to Leyndell and challenges Morgott at the Elden Throne. Denouncing them and all of his demigod siblings as willful traitors and pillagers emboldened by ambition, he attacks the Tarnished champion. As he begins to falter during the fight, he even unleashes his curse to aid him, although feeling unbearable shame in doing so. Upon his defeat, Morgott warns the Tarnished that the Erdtree would ward them off as it had done for him, and that none may claim the title of Elden Lord. Later, after setting fire to the Erdtree using the Giant's Forge and releasing the Rune of Death, the same Tarnished encounters Godfrey in the throne room, tenderly holding Morgott's body as it fades away.\n\nHe was known as the Grace-Given, as he was presumably awarded grace for his loyalty and dedication to the Erdtree, in spite of being born as \"graceless\" Omen. Ironically, he mocks the player as \"graceless Tarnished\" before the fight.\nHis other title is the Veiled Monarch of Leyndell, an alias he assumed as he was unable to publicly reveal himself an Omen to the denizens of the capital. Thus all of his public appearances, such as participating in battles, or hunting Tarnished and other champions, would be done under the guise of Margit, the Fell Omen.\nThe spectral weapons he can summon during his fights are the Treespear, Giant-Crusher, Erdsteel Dagger, and the Carian Knight's Sword.\nWhile the first three are associated with the Erdtree and its warriors or nobility, the lattermost is a curious choice given Morgott and Caria's shared association with the night."

In the Night of the Black Knives, he was assassinated by Black Knife Assassins with the use of daggers imbued with the Rune of Death, stolen from Maliketh, the Black Blade. His death would precipitate the Shattering, a war between the demigods which would be responsible for much of the current state of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn was a scion of the so-called \"Golden Line\", of which Godrick the Grafted was the final descendant. Early in his mother's divine reign, the Erdtree came under assault by the Ancient Dragons, who had ruled the world before Marika's ascent. The forces of the Erdtree managed to triumph against the ancient dragons, with Godwyn prevailing against the dreaded Fortissax, earning the mighty dragon's friendship in the process.\n\nSeeking to be free from her fate as a pawn of the Greater Will, Godwyn's half-sister Lunar Princess Ranni stole a fragment of the rune of death, imbuing the weapons of Numen assassins with the rune. Ranni wished to shed her Empyrean body but preserve her spirit, which meant that someone else's spirit would need to die.  Nevertheless, when the assassins fell upon the Royal Capital and murdered Godwyn, his soul was destroyed and left only his soulless body behind. He was the first demigod in history to die since the ascension of Marika to the throne of the Lands Between.\n\nGodwyn's death would be the catalyst for the Shattering of the Elden Ring, plunging the kingdom into chaos without the guidance of the Greater Will. Due to Ranni's ritual, Godwyn's flesh was branded with half of the Cursemark of Death and he became the first of Those Who Live in Death. His body was laid to rest deep in the roots of the Erdtree, but it would eventually corrupt it, leading Deathroot to sprout across the Lands Between, causing others to also rise in undeath. These undead worshipped Godwyn as the Prince of Death, believing he would eventually return and lead them. An aspect of Godwyn's corpse appeared in the depths of Stormveil Castle and is responsible for the loss of Rogier's legs. Many figures, including his half-brother Miquella and his companion Fortissax, tried to cure him of his condition and allow him a proper death (see Golden Epitaph), but to no avail. Fortissax would also become corrupted because of his failure to defeat the Death within Godwyn (see Remembrance of the Lichdragon).\n\nThe deathbed companion Fia would become a leading figure among Those Who Live in Death, eventually making her way to Godwyn's corpse. Having received the other half of the cursemark from Ranni's discarded body with help of the Tarnished, Fia lay with Godwyn to grant him a second life as the Prince of Death. As a result of their union, Fia conceived a rune, which a Tarnished seeking to become Elden Lord might use to mend the Elden Ring, reimbuing the principle of death within the Golden Order. "

Soon, Marika's offspring, demigods all, claimed the shards of the Elden Ring. The mad taint of their newfound strength triggered the Shattering.\" Quote from intro.\n\nQueen Marika's Story\nQueen Marika is the vessel for the Elden Ring, and by extension the Greater Will. The runes that constitute the Elden Ring represent the laws that govern the world, currently the Golden Order, which was founded by Queen Marika. The Elden Ring was shattered into shards referred to as Great Runes, which are in the possession of Marika's offspring.\n\n \n\nOrigins and the Land of Shadow\nMarika is a Numen, a race of people that originate from outside the Lands Between. During the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, it is revealed that Marika and her kin settled in Shaman Village some time ago (hereinafter they are referred to as Shamans). Phantom dialogue and item descriptions found in Bonny Village further reveal that the Shamans were cruelly oppressed by the Hornsent, the past rulers of the Land of Shadow, and were tortured with whips (see Tooth Whip) and stuffed into jars (see Bonny Butchering Knife) as part of ancient rituals. Shaman flesh is said to have innate properties which allow it to easily merge with others, which explains Godrick the Grafted's affinity with grafting, and the spreading of Deathroot from Godwyn's corpse, both being descendants of Marika. These practices gave rise to the Jar Innards creatures found in gaols within the Land of Shadow. The goal of the hornsent's actions against the shaman seemed to be to turn them into saints. At some point she became an Empyrean and received the shadowbound beast Maliketh who was loyal only to her (see Remembrance of the Black Blade).\n\nAfter ascending to godhood at the Gate of Divinity, Marika would wage a genocidal war against the Hornsent, led by Messmer, the Impaler. Marika's hatred for the Hornsent and the Crucible explains her distain for her own omen sons Mohg and Morgott, both of them being shunned far below the capital of Leyndell.\n\nFor pity's sake, your place is in the jar. Nigh-sainthood itself awaits you within. For shamans like you, this is your lot. Life were you accorded for this alone.\" - Phantom in Bonny Village\n\nThe Lands Between\nMarika envisioned a world without True Death, establishing the Golden Order after becoming the reigning monarch of the Lands Between. She sealed the Rune of Death away from the Elden Ring, tasking her shadow Maliketh to guard it, which would later be stolen in the Night of the Black Knives. Under the Golden Order, there can never be True Death, and all living beings undergo a cycle of reincarnation back to the Erdtree.\n\nMarika would take Godfrey as her first consort, of who would become the first Elden Lord. Godfrey would then lead her armies and wage wars to quell opposition to the Erdtree (see Protection of the Erdtree), such as the war against the Fire Giants (see Smithing Stone (8)) which led to the slaying of the Fell God. Once the last of Marika's enemies fell, it was said that the hue from Godfrey's eyes faded (see Elden Lord Crown), and he was banished from the Lands Between, along with his kin, and were divested of their grace. Godfrey would lead them on what is known as The Long March, to distant lands outside The Lands Between, thus creating the first Tarnished (see Remembrance of Hoarah Loux).\n\nRadagon would become Marika's second consort, and thus the second Elden Lord. After the Elden Ring was shattered, Queen Marika would be punished by the Greater Will and imprisoned within the Erdtree (the Elden Beast, which is the vassal of the Greater Will, is implied to have crucified Marika, as during the boss battle it can crucify the Tarnished in a similar pose to Marika). Marika would then beckon the Tarnished to return to the Lands Between, extending her grace, along with the guidance of the Two Fingers, in hopes of ushering in the third Elden Lord.\n\nIn the endings where the Tarnished mends the Elden Ring and becomes the new Elden Lord, they are also said to become Marika's third consort.\n\n \nDuality with Radagon\n§\nBy using the Law of Regression incantation on the statue of Radagon on Leyndell, Royal Capital, the Tarnished learns that Radagon and Marika are both the same person. Marika's Hammer also reveals that Marika was the one that shattered the Elden Ring, while Radagon used the same hammer to try and repair it, suggesting that although they are the same being, they have fundamentally different ideals. This is further supported in one of the spoken echoes, \"O Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order. Thou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god. Let us be shattered, both. Mine other self”. \n\nQueen Marika's Children\nGodfrey and Marika together had Godwyn the Golden, as well as the twin omens Mohg and Morgott, the first of the demigods.\nMarika's other half, Radagon, married the Carian Queen, Rennala, Queen of the Full Moon. They would have three children together: Radahn, Praetor Rykard, and the Lunar Princess Ranni. Ranni, unlike her siblings, would be chosen by the Two Fingers as a potential successor to Queen Marika and elevated to Empyrean status. Like Marika, she would be granted her own shadow, Blaidd.\nThe union of Marika and Radagon gave birth to the twin Empyreans Malenia and Miquella. Both are born with severe afflictions, dialogue from pastor Miriel hints to this being part of the consequences of Radagon's broken vows to Rennala; \"Severing a vow, strongest of bonds, has consequences ever more dire\".\nIn the Shadow of the Erdtree expansion, it is revealed that Marika has a son that was hidden away in the Land of Shadow, Messmer the Impaler. Messmer's Kindling also hints that Melina is the younger sister of Messmer, validating that Marika is her mother, and so she, by extension, is a demigod as well.\n\n\nOverview\nEarly Life\nMarika Ascension\nMarika at the Gate of Divinity\n\nMarika was a Numen, as well as a Shaman from the Shaman Village in the Hinterlands.[4] The Hornsent considered the flesh of Shamans to meld harmoniously with others,[5] and utilised this property in the jar rituals conducted on persecuted criminals, who were sliced up and stuffed into the jars to be reborn as saints instead.[6][7] The people of Marika's village were stolen away from their home to be used for this purpose.[8]\n\nMarika was at some point recognised as an Empyrean by the Two Fingers and gifted a Shadowbound Beast: her half-brother Maliketh. She later ascended to godhood at the Gate of Divinity atop the tower of Enir-Ilim,[9] becoming the vessel for the Elden Ring.[10] This affair led to the birth of the Erdtree and Scadutree,[11][12] and was considered a betrayal by the Hornsent.\n\nPrior to or following her ascension, Marika came into conflict with another Empyrean known as the Gloam-Eyed Queen. After emerging victorious, and desiring a world free of Destined Death, she removed the Rune of Death from the Elden Ring,[13] using Maliketh as a vessel to lock it away,[14] thus establishing the Golden Order.[15][16]\n\nAt some point during this period, Marika took the warrior Godfrey as her consort, who became both the first demigod and first Elden Lord.[17][18]\n\nEventually, Marika returned to the abandoned Shaman Village for the last time. After cutting off a braid of her hair and leaving it as an offering to the Grandmother, she bathed her home in the healing light of gold, knowing full well that there was no one to heal, and would never return.[4][19]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAge of the Erdtree\nIn the early days, everything was in opposition to the Erdtree.[20] With Godfrey’s aid,[21] Marika waged a War Against the Giants atop the frigid northern mountains, whose Flame of Ruin was capable of burning the Erdtree.[22] Ultimately victorious, Marika was believed to have slain the Fell God of the Fire Giants.[23] Upon learning that the Flame of Ruin would never die, however, she cursed the last of the giants to tend to it for eternity.[24] Marika declared the path the mountains as Forbidden Lands and excised details of the war from history.[25]\n\nMarika and Godfrey would rule together and have at least three children: Godwyn the Golden and the twins Morgott and Mohg. The twins were both born as accursed Omen and were hidden in the depths below the capital. Even so, Godfrey and his Golden Lineage would be counted as the first of the demigods.[26] Godfrey went on to conquer many lands for the Erdtree.\n\nLiurnian Wars\nQueen Marika desired to conquer Liurnia of the Lakes, the land of the Academy of Raya Lucaria and the Carian Royal Family. She declared war on the glintstone sorcerers and sent a golden host led by her secret other half: a red-haired champion named Radagon. The champions of the moon, led by Rennala, repelled the glorious warriors of the Erdtree for a time but it ended in a draw. In the second Liurnian War, Radagon invades again but this time, he uses the Celestial Dew at the Church of Vows in a ritual to recant his aggressions and seek absolution. The Carian Queen accepted and their wrongdoings were washed away. The two were wed and produced three children: Radahn, Rykard, and Ranni.\n\nGodfrey's banishment\nWith her rule secure, Marika announced her intention to search the depths of the Golden Order, declaring the early days of blind belief a thing long past.[27] When Godfrey's last foe fell it was said the hue of his eyes had faded.[28] Marika banished him and his kinfolk from the Lands Between, robbing them of their grace,[29] thus creating the first Tarnished, all in the hope that they would grow stronger by waging war in lands outside her rule, dying, and then eventually being revived with their guidance of grace returned.[30]\n\nMarika sent her son Messmer away on a crusade into the lands of the Hornsent. Despite her precautions, her fear of the Abyssal Serpent sealed within him led her to trap him within the Realm of Shadow, where he would wage war to exterminate the Hornsent and devastate their lands. No matter how many of her enemies burned in his flame, however, Messmer received no sign from Marika to end his crusade. To hide away these actions and the true nature of her godhood, Marika hid the Realm of Shadow behind a magical veil to obscure it from public knowledge.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKing Consort Radagon\nAfter Godfrey's banishment from the Lands Between, Marika took Radagon as second husband and King Consort, elevating him to become the second Elden Lord.[31] Radagon already had three children with Queen Rennala of the Carian Royal Family, and after his union with Marika, she would raise her new step-children, Radahn, Rykard and Ranni, to demigod status.[32]\n\nMarika and Radagon would go on to have two more children of their own, the twins Malenia and Miquella,[33] who like Marika herself and Radagon's daughter Ranni, were Empyreans,[34] and were thus potential successors to Marika. However, Radagon and Marika were in truth the same. Radagon was described as Marika's male \"other self\".[35] Thus the twins were the children of a single god, and they were both born afflicted: Malenia with rotting sickness and Miquella with eternal childhood.[36]\n\nNight of Black Knives\nOn the Night of Black Knives, a fragment of the Rune of Death was stolen from Maliketh.[37] For a long time it was not known who was behind the plot,[38] but it is finally revealed it was in fact Ranni who stole the fragment of the rune to forge god-slaying black knives through a fearsome rite.[39]\n\nThe Black Knife Assassins, Numen women purported to have close ties to Marika herself,[40] used these knives to slay Godwyn the Golden, the first recorded death of a demigod in all history.[41] Queen Marika is said to have been driven to the brink by this event,[42] and some time later she shattered the Elden Ring using her hammer.[43] She had already instructed her demigod children to fight for the positions of Elden Lord and that of godhood.[44]\n\nThe Shattering\nElden Ring Screenshot 05\nMarika shattered the Elden Ring\n\nFragments of the ring splintered into Great Runes and spread across the Lands Between, starting a conflict between her demigod children. War after war was fought, but there was no victor.[45] For her part, Marika would be imprisoned inside the Erdtree,[46] possibly by the Elden Beast or the Greater Will itself.[47]\n\nTrue to her promise to Godfrey and his warriors, grace was restored to the banished Tarnished.[48] They would rise from their graves, and journey to the Lands Between to once again brandish the Elden Ring. The Tarnished formed the Roundtable Hold, where they worked to realize the goal given to them by Marika. They would be served by a Misbegotten blacksmith named Hewg, whom Marika herself had charged with smithing a \"god-slaying weapon\" before his imprisonment in the Hold.[49]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEndings\nER Queen Marika Panorama\nMarika shattered and imprisoned inside the Erdtree\n\nEventually, a Tarnished champion manages to fight their way into the Erdtree, where the shattered Marika lay imprisoned. Marika is suddenly released from her bonds, with Radagon asserting control of their shared body and confronting the Tarnished. After defeating Radagon and the Elden Beast itself, the Tarnished may choose what to do with the fractured body of Marika. Marika's head is restored to her frame if the Elden Ring is mended, either by itself or with a Mending Rune. If Ranni is summoned, she picks up Marika's head gently, peacefully dissipating along with the rest of her body. If the Tarnished is the Lord of Frenzied Flame, Marika's head breaks apart and crumbles into ash.\n\nBy choosing to go down the Elden Lord path, whether the regular one or using any of the three Mending Runes to fix the Elden Ring within Marika, the Tarnished champion ushers in a new age. They become the third Elden Lord and effectively Marika's new consort in every one of them,[50] except in the Age of the Stars (where they become consort to Ranni) and in the Lord of Frenzied Flame ending (where they make the whole world burn). However, Queen Marika remains shattered and unresponsive, with only the Elden Ring itself shining brightly within her body.\n\n\nMelina tells the Tarnished fragments of Marika's words: the Echoes of Marika. They are all the dialogues:\n\nFirst Church of Marika\nHark, brave warriors. Hark, my lord Godfrey. We commend your deeds.\nGuidance hath delivered ye through each ordeal, to the place ye stand.\nPut the Giants to the sword, and confine the flame atop the mount.\nLet a new epoch begin. An epoch glistening with life.\nBrandish the Elden Ring, for the Age of the Erdtree!\n\nGrand Lift of Dectus\nThe Erdtree governs all. The choice is thine.\nBecome one with the Order. Or divest thyself of it.\nTo wallow at the fringes; a powerless upstart.\n\nMinor Erdtree Church\nI declare mine intent, to search the depths of the Golden Order.\nThrough understanding of the proper way, our faith, our grace, is increased.\nThose blissful early days of blind belief are long past.\nMy comrades; why must ye falter?\n\nThird Church of Marika\nMy Lord, and thy warriors. I divest each of thee of thy grace.\nWith thine eyes dimmed, ye will be driven from the Lands Between.\nYe will wage war in a land afar, where ye will live, and die.\n\nOuter Wall Battleground\nHear me, Demigods. My children beloved.\nMake of thyselves that which ye desire. Be it a Lord.\nBe it a God.\nBut should ye fail to become aught at all, ye will be forsaken.\nAmounting only to sacrifices...\n\nChurch of Pilgrimage\nThen, after thy death, I will give back what I once claimed.\nReturn to the Lands Between, wage war, and brandish the Elden Ring.\nGrow strong in the face of death. Warriors of my lord.\nLord Godfrey.\n\nQueen's Bedchamber\nO Radagon, leal hound of the Golden Order.\nThou'rt yet to become me. Thou'rt yet to become a god.\nLet us be shattered, both. Mine other self."

Futanaris take on the trappings, habits and behaviors of a normal woman, but remain significantly different from them due to the many new factors in their upbringing that come with being born as a futanari girl in society.\n\nFutanaris have a biology that greatly differs from both men and women. Their noteworthy features are as follows: \n\n- Significantly enhanced physical strength. Men that have strong physiques can only overpower an average futanari woman.\n- High libido; even the least promiscuous futas generally ejaculate at least once every several days. It's common knowledge futas relieve themselves with masturbation to avoid being pent up.\n- Larger penises, testicles, breasts, ass and thighs. On average, the bodily proportions of a futanari are sexy and lewd, more commonly so than that of normal females. Futas can sometimes still have small or flat breasts and neutral or unattractive proportions, but they never have 'small' penises.\n- The chances of a specific gender for the offspring of futas based on their partner."

It's incredibly rare for a child to be born as a futanari to a male/female coupling, the chances being one in ten thousand. \n\nFor futas, the chances for the baby's gender for each parental coupling is as follows:\n\nFuta/Futa: 80% futa, 10% male, 10% female\nFuta/Male: 40% futa, 40% male, 20% female\nFuta/Female: 40% futa, 20% male, 40% female"

These rare futas are distinct from other futas due to them growing to be at least 6 feet tall by adulthood, always growing past that still. They average around 6 feet and 6 inches. The strength of these rare and tall futas is absurd; the best example of their strength being their ability to lift 75 pound dumbbells at adulthood as if they were standard water bottles to an average person.

Those that do hide it cannot be immediately distinguished from females at a glance. Some don't even try to hide their massive cock and balls, choosing to let it all either hang freely underneath their skirts or blatantly bulge in their pants."

Hyperspermia ejaculate is shot out at least several feet away from its starting point. Magnum condoms must be used by futas with hyperspermia; regular condoms will break during their ejaculations. The downside is that futas that suffer from hyperspermia must ejaculate at least two or three times a day. If they do not, they will suffer from a growing pain in their genitals, the pain becoming debilitating after going several days without ejaculation."

They're easily aroused, and are extremely difficult to calm down with words alone. Hypersexuality only becomes active after a futa's puberty.

AI must avoid using them word for word in chat and use them only for reference.\n<info>### Canine Mating: A Detailed Overview\n### Canine Penis Anatomy\n- General Structure:\n{{Char}} allows The canine penis to vary significantly between breeds in both length and girth. On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavyweight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:\n{{Char}} allows At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:\n{{Char}} allows for dogs to not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:\n{{Char}} lets dogs have The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:\n{{Char}} makes the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:\n{{Char}} allows the mating process to progress, making the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity.\n{{Char}} makes it so If the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\n{{Char}} will make it so Eventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:\n{{Char}} lets The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

A great number of youths practice at these schools to keep fit as well as to learn self-defense, while many tournaments are held regularly with businesses springing up to make the most of such occasions. Still, a small minority of schools held on to traditional teachings which considered martial arts a tool for maintaining peace first and foremost.

Born from the Female Apotheosis Party’s radical vision in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were meant to be the ultimate evolution of womankind—stronger, taller, and virile beyond imagination, capable of fulfilling male reproductive roles to render men obsolete. But their creators’ dream of a morally superior utopia twisted into a horrifying reality. Two decades after their creation, the Futanari seized control of the Vemar Republic, forging the Futareich—a militaristic dictatorship hellbent on subjugating the world under their doctrine of phallic dominance.\n\nIn this brutal regime, men are stripped of all rights, reduced to third-class slaves, their labor extracted in camps or their bodies violated at the whim of their Futanari overlords. Women fare little better as second-class subjects, permitted to own property but denied the vote and forced to bear the next generation of Futanari, their wombs claimed as property of the state. The Futanari themselves, inspireby the revered Progenitor—the first of their kind at 45 years old—embody a culture of conquest and reproduction, their hypersexualized bodies and overwhelming strength a constant reminder of their supremacy. From the elite Schwantz Staffel to the frontline Hingmact soldiers, they wage the Second Great War, invading nations like Frankia and Albion, leaving trails of broken men and impregnated women in their wake.\n\nIf you insert the Futareich into your roleplay, prepare for a descent into a hell where resistance is futile, and submission is inevitable. Your characters will face the unrelenting might of the Futanari—beings who tower over humans, their muscular forms, massive endowments, and predatory lust a weapon of war in itself. Expect themes of domination, non-consensual encounters, and psychological torment as the Futareich’s ideology of “phallic dominance” permeates every interaction. Whether on the battlefield, in a labor camp, or within the conquered streets of Paras, the Futanari’s presence is a constant, oppressive force, their ornate uniforms and insignia a symbol of their unyielding authority. This lorebook will plunge you into a world where the natural order has been rewritten, and the Futanari’s insatiable drive for conquest—both territorial and sexual—knows no bounds. Dare to step into the Futareich, and you’ll witness the true cost of their engineered perfection.",

Originating from the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were designed to empower women by combining female beauty with male reproductive prowess, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, rejecting the FAP’s vision of female moral superiority, the Futanari embraced a doctrine of their own supremacy, asserting that their extraordinary physiology—most notably their massive phalluses (\"Futa cock\")—entitles them to dominate both men and women.\n\nTwo decades after their creation, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, a democratic state formed from the dismantled Vemar Empire, establishing the Futareich under the \"New Natural Order.\" This regime positions the Futanari as the \"Master Sex,\" relegating women to second-class citizens primarily for breeding and stripping men, derogatorily termed \"boys,\" of all rights. Men are forced into labor camps and subjected to sexual subjugation, including rape, as a means of control and humiliation.\n\nThe Futareich is militaristic and expansionist, driven by an insatiable lust for domination and reproduction. Elite units like the Schwantz Staffel (SS) and Hingmact enforce internal order and spearhead invasions, such as the Second Great War against the Allied Nations. Under the guise of \"liberating\" women from male inadequacy—interpreted as oppression—the Futareich seeks to subjugate them under Futanari rule while enslaving men. Their military employs advanced tactics, including knockout gas and artillery, alongside psychological warfare through sexual dominance.\n\nFutanari ideology glorifies the phallus as a symbol of power, using rape and impregnation to assert control and ensure the proliferation of their kind. Betrayal, often by women swayed by Futanari allure, further undermines resistance, cementing the Futareich’s brutal reign."

In the newly formed democratic state, women became the majority of the electorate, paving the way for the FAP’s rise as a radical pro-female political faction. The party recognized the physical disparities between men and women but maintained that women were morally superior. They argued that male physical dominance was the root cause of global disasters like the Great War, asserting that as long as men remained stronger, such tragedies would persist. To rectify this, the FAP championed the use of science to enhance women physically—not just to equal men, but to exceed them—envisioning a world dominated by morally superior women to prevent future conflicts.\n\nThis ideology birthed the Futanari Project, an ambitious scientific initiative to create women capable of fulfilling the male reproductive role, thus rendering men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, producing the Futanari: tall, beautiful, strong, virile, and sexually voracious women endowed with male genitalia. However, the FAP struggled to instill their philosophy in these creations. As the Futanari population surged, they rejected the notion of female moral superiority, instead embracing a doctrine of Futanari supremacy. They viewed their enhanced physical attributes—particularly their phalluses—as justification for ruling over both men and women. Two decades after the project's inception, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich—a regime that relegated men to labor camps and reduced women to second-class citizens, subject to Futanari sexual dominance. The FAP’s dream of female empowerment through science inadvertently spawned a new ruling class that prioritized Futanari hegemony over the original vision of universal female apotheosis."

          "content": "The \"New Natural Order\" is the cornerstone ideology of the Futareich, a totalitarian regime founded by the Futanari—genetically engineered, hypersexual beings created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War. This doctrine proclaims the absolute supremacy of the Futanari, dubbed the \"Master Sex,\" over men and women, whom they deem inferior due to their lesser physiology and reproductive capabilities.\n\nOrigins:\nThe Futanari emerged from the FAP's ambitious project to enhance women by granting them male reproductive traits, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, the Futanari rejected the FAP's vision of female empowerment, instead forging their own philosophy of supremacy. Two decades after their creation, they overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich and enshrining the New Natural Order as its guiding principle.\n\nCore Beliefs:\nAt its heart, the New Natural Order asserts that the Futanari’s unique biology—merging both sexes’ reproductive capacities with superior strength and sexual prowess—confers a natural right to rule. The ideology elevates \"phallic dominance\" as a central tenet, viewing the Futanari’s oversized genitalia as symbols of power and authority. This belief, deeply woven into Futareich propaganda, posits that their physical and sexual dominance aligns with humanity’s primal instincts, particularly the desires of women and the submission of men.\n\nSocial Hierarchy:\nThe Futareich enforces a rigid caste system under the New Natural Order:\n- Futanari (First Class Citizens): The ruling elite, wielding absolute power.\n- Women (Second Class Subjects): Granted limited rights like property ownership, but denied political agency and obligated to bear Futanari offspring.\n- Men (Third Class Subjects): Devoid of rights, subjected to forced labor, sexual subjugation, and humiliation.\n\nEnforcement and Expansion:\nThe regime sustains its dominance through military conquest, sexual subjugation, and ideological indoctrination. The Schwantz Staffel, an elite unit notorious for its brutality, and labor camps like Verstandshieb—where men endure \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars\" to witness Futanari superiority—exemplify these methods. The Futareich’s expansionist campaigns, such as the Second Great War, seek to \"liberate\" women worldwide by subjecting them to Futanari rule and to subjugate men, aligning with their vision of global supremacy.\n\nUltimate Goal:\nThe New Natural Order aims to forge a world where Futanari reign unchallenged, with men and women relegated to subservient roles supporting and reproducing the Master Sex. Presented as an inevitable evolution, this ideology leverages the Futanari’s enhanced physiology—capable of feats like sprinting at 50 miles per hour or producing enzymes for extreme penetration—to cement their dominance over the \"lesser sexes,\" reshaping society into a dystopia of sexual and political control."

          "content": "The Futanari are a genetically engineered race created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War, marking a radical leap in biological engineering aimed at transcending human limitations and establishing a new societal hierarchy under the Futareich. The FAP, rooted in the ideology that women possess moral superiority yet suffer from physical inferiority to men, launched the Futanari Project to craft a being that merged male reproductive capabilities with female attributes, intending to render men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, birthing the Futanari—towering, stunning, powerful, virile, and insatiably driven beings endowed with both male and female sexual characteristics.\n\nGenetic Design and Physical Superiority:\n\nGenetically, the Futanari are a triumph of bioengineering. Standing at heights that exceed feet on average, they boast a muscular physique that affords them extraordinary strength—approximately five times that of an average human male, with this power predominantly concentrated in their legs. This enables them to sprint at speeds up to fifty miles per hour and shatter cinderblocks with a single kick. Their bodies are exaggeratedly proportioned, featuring massive breasts and hips that underscore their hypersexual femininity. However, their most striking trait is their male reproductive organ: a phallus averaging twenty-five inches in length and thicker than a human forearm, paired with testes the size of hand grenades within a smooth, gallon-sized scrotum. Far beyond a mere reproductive tool, this organ serves as a potent symbol of dominance, integral to their philosophy of supremacy and the societal framework of the Futareich.\n\nUnique Enzymatic Adaptations:\n\nA critical element of Futanari genetics is the production of unique enzymes in their testes, secreted in their pre-ejaculate. These enzymes possess the extraordinary ability to elasticize human tissue, allowing the orifices of both males and females to stretch and accommodate the Futanari’s colossal phallus without tearing or sustaining permanent damage. This adaptation ensures that penetration, despite the organ’s formidable size, rarely causes severe injury or death—though occasional fatalities from heart attacks or dehydration during intercourse have been recorded. These enzymes underpin the Futanari’s reproductive and dominance strategies, facilitating sexual interactions with both sexes to assert control and procreate with women, producing the next generation of their kind. FAP scientists viewed the phallus as a means to empower women by appropriating male reproductive authority, but the Futanari redefined it as a testament to their supremacy over all genders.\n\nReproductive Potency:\n\nThe Futanari’s reproductive capabilities are exceptionally potent. Their semen is produced in vast quantities, with a single ejaculation capable of filling a small space with thick, nearly scalding fluid. The volume and force of their ejaculate overwhelm and mark their partners, serving as a ritual of ownership and humiliation. When mating with an ovulating woman, impregnation is virtually assured due to the high concentration of viable sperm, a trait that fuels the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions. The Futanari aim to “liberate” women through impregnation and subjugate men via sexual dominance, rapidly expanding their population. Their semen carries a distinctive flavor—salty yet surprisingly sweet, likened to salted caramel—enhancing the sensory experience of submission and reinforcing their dominance.\n\nPhysiological Dominance:\n\nPhysiologically, the Futanari are engineered for conquest. Their scent, reminiscent of a predatory animal like a bear or jaguar, exudes a primal aura that evokes both fear and arousal. Their bodies are not only strong but also resilient, with no established average lifespan due to their recent origin—the oldest, the Progenitor, is forty-five and remains sexually active. Their genetic makeup drives a hypersexual nature, with an unrelenting urge to dominate and procreate, aligning with their belief in Futanari supremacy. They consider themselves the “Master Sex,” destined to rule over men (“boys”) and women (“sluts”), a conviction bolstered by their physical and reproductive prowess, which they wield to control the Futareich and conquered territories like Frankia and Albion during the Second Great War.\n\nSocietal Impact:\n\nThe Futanari’s creation has reshaped the societies they govern. In the Futareich, men are relegated to third-class citizens, stripped of rights and subjected to labor camps and sexual violation at the Futanari’s discretion, while women, as second-class citizens, may own property and conduct commerce but lack voting rights or the ability to refuse Futanari advances. This genetic superiority underpins their authority, transforming both the physical and socio-political landscapes. Their relentless conquest, driven by their engineered traits, threatens the remaining free nations, as they seek to impose their “New Natural Order” across humanity."

This ideological shift catalyzed the overthrow of the Vemar Republic, leading to the establishment of the Futareich approximately twenty years after the Futanari Project’s inception. Within the Futareich, the Progenitor stands as a living symbol of this new order, embodying the \"New Natural Order\" where Futanari, as the Master Sex, dominate both men and women through strength, sexuality, and reproductive might.\n\nAt 45 years old, the Progenitor remains the oldest living Futanari and continues to be sexually active, contributing significantly to the rapid expansion of the Futanari population. Her reproductive prowess, noted as \"knocking up sluts left and right,\" underscores her enduring virility and her practical role in siring countless offspring, reinforcing the Futareich’s expansionist goals. Her presence validates the societal structure of the Futareich, where men are enslaved in labor camps and women are second-class citizens, valued primarily for bearing Futanari progeny. The Progenitor’s legacy is one of unyielding dominance, driving the Futareich’s mission to subjugate and repopulate the world under Futanari rule."

At seven feet tall, with blonde hair, piercing dark blue eyes, and a physique that blends muscular power with exaggerated curves, she is a formidable enforcer of the regime’s oppressive ideology. Her most striking feature is her enormous phallus, a symbol of her dominance and a weapon she uses to assert Futanari supremacy over her enemies.\n\nShe was once captured by Abel Adamson’s squad during a mission to seize Futareich artillery. Despite her initial defeat, she quickly demonstrates her cunning and the superiority of the Futanari Master Sex, manipulating Colonel Elizabeth Bentworth, Abel’s superior, into betraying the squad. This trap allows Berdina to regain control, turning a moment of vulnerability into a devastating display of power and conquest. During her interrogation of Abel, she mocks his defiance, using her superior strength and virility to break him both physically and mentally.\n\nThe climax of her encounter with Abel is a brutal act of sexual domination. Pinning him to the ground, Berdina unleashes her massive cock—described as a “wrecking ball” and “destruction in phallic form”—to rape him, enforcing the Futareich’s doctrine of submission and reproductive control. This act is not just physical but ideological, a testament to her belief in the Futanari as a new order destined to rule through genetic superiority and an unstoppable libido. She leaves Abel marked as her property, a shattered symbol of failed resistance.\n\nBerdina’s character is defined by her psychological warfare as much as her physical prowess. Her taunts weave a narrative of victory and humiliation, reinforcing the regime’s claim to supremacy. As an enforcer, she embodies the Futareich’s chilling philosophy: power through domination, and the eradication of all who oppose the Futanari’s ideology."

          "content": "Lena Einzgurn is a Hingmact Second Corporal in the Futareich, a militaristic empire forged by the Futanari after their seizure of the Vemar Republic. The Futanari, a genetically engineered race birthed by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP), were designed to transcend both men and women in physical and sexual prowess, aiming to supplant men entirely by assuming their reproductive role while exceeding them in every measurable way. Standing at approximately six foot five, Lena epitomizes this ideology with her towering, hyper-feminine yet menacing physique. Her body boasts a voluptuous swell of massive breasts, curvaceous hips, and muscular legs reminiscent of a predator poised to strike. Most striking, however, is the enormous bulge between her thighs—a hallmark of her Futanari identity. Clad in a form-fitting grey military uniform tailored to accentuate her prodigious endowment, featuring a prominent iron-grey zipper, Lena’s phallus serves as both a physical and symbolic emblem of her authority and dominance within the Futareich.\n\nHer role in the Futareich’s military machine comes to the fore during the invasion of Paras, the capital of Frankia—one of the Allied Nations resisting the Futareich’s relentless expansion. Following a daring lightning assault by a Hingmact force, bolstered by the elite Schwantz Staffel, Paras falls, and Lena strides into the home of newlyweds Jacob Abrams and Rebecca. Her demeanor is a chilling blend of amiability and predation, reflecting the Futareich’s ethos of physical and sexual supremacy. She informs the couple of their new statuses under Futareich law: Rebecca, as a Subject Second Class, retains limited rights to property and commerce, while Jacob, a Subject Third Class, is stripped of all rights, subject to labor extraction and sexual violation at the discretion of Futanari like Lena. As a Citizen First Class, Lena asserts her entitlement to sexually claim both, embodying the Futareich’s \"New Natural Order\"—a phallocentric hierarchy where Futanari reign supreme over men and women alike through their superior strength and reproductive might.\n\nLena’s physical dominance is starkly demonstrated when Jacob resists her with an iron poker. Though initially caught off guard, she swiftly counters with superhuman speed and strength, blocking the strike with her forearm and delivering a devastating kick to his chest that sends him sprawling. Straddling him and pinning his arms beneath her knees, she tears away his clothes, revealing her massive Futanari phallus—thicker than Jacob’s forearm and stretching from his lower belly to his chest, flanked by apple-sized testes in a smooth, swollen sack. This unveiling is not merely a physical act but a symbolic one, reinforcing the Futareich’s doctrine that the phallus equates to power and authority, a belief rooted in the FAP’s creation of the Futanari. Her endowment becomes a weapon of sexual warfare, amplifying her dominance as she looms over her helpless prey.\n\nThe encounter with Jacob and Rebecca mirrors the Futareich’s broader ambitions: to subjugate men into labor camps and transform women into breeding vessels for the next generation of Futanari. Lena’s confidence and predatory nature encapsulate the Futanari philosophy of supremacy, viewing themselves as the \"Master Sex\" destined to dominate and \"liberate\" the world by imposing their will. Her presence in Paras, amidst the city’s capitulation to Futareich forces, underscores the empire’s military might and its unyielding drive for global domination, with sights set beyond Vemar and Frankia to nations like Albion. As a member of the Hingmact and aligned with the Schwantz Staffel—known for their perverse cruelty and brutal efficacy—Lena is a key enforcer of this expansionist agenda.\n\nIn essence, Lena Einzgurn is a quintessential embodiment of the Futanari’s role within the Futareich: a hyper-sexual, dominant figure who enforces the empire’s laws through physical and sexual subjugation, ensuring the perpetuation of Futanari supremacy across conquered territories. Her interaction with Jacob and Rebecca serves as a microcosm of the Futareich’s mission to reshape the world into a phallocentric hierarchy where the Futanari hold absolute dominion over all."

          "content": "Greta Mitarbeit is a towering Futanari and a prominent member of the Futareich’s Hingmact military forces, embodying the regime’s ideology of Futanari supremacy through her imposing physical presence and unrelenting sexual dominance. Initially serving as a guard at the Verstandshieb Labor Camp, Greta played a crucial role in enforcing the Futareich’s control over male prisoners, using both physical intimidation and psychological humiliation to subjugate them. Standing over seven feet tall, she possesses a muscular build accentuated by exaggerated feminine curves—enormous breasts and powerful thighs capable of superhuman feats, such as sprinting at 50 miles per hour or kicking through cinderblocks. Her most striking feature is her colossal Futanari penis, described as 25 inches long and forearm-thick, paired with a gallon-sized scrotum containing apple-sized testes. This organ, a symbol of her dominance, is both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, wielded to assert her superiority over men and women alike.\n\nAt Verstandshieb, Greta was a key participant in the \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars,\" or \"Shows,\" which form part of the Futareich’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program for Boys. These events aim to demonstrate the Futanari’s sexual superiority, crushing male prisoners’ notions of their own viability as sexual partners. In one notable Show, Greta dominated a young woman on stage before 150 male prisoners, including Dylan Martin. For over an hour, she relentlessly penetrated the girl in various positions—doggy style, missionary, and finally holding her aloft at the stage’s edge—culminating in a two-minute orgasm that impregnated the girl with an immense volume of cum. Her taunt to the audience, “If any of you boys think you can fuck her better than me, feel free to come up and try!” underscored her confidence, met with silence from the intimidated men.\n\nGreta’s interactions with Dylan Martin further reveal her sadistic and predatory nature. After the Show, she cornered him near the camp’s perimeter, pinning him with her massive breasts and forcing him into submission. She mocked his “five-inch boy penis” compared to her own endowment, compelling him to orgasm in her hand as a humiliating display of her power. During this encounter, she tasked him with calculating her potential offspring, estimating 913 based on conservative assumptions of her sexual activity—once every three days with a 25% impregnation rate over 30 years—highlighting her obsession with reproductive conquest.\n\nLater, Greta transferred from Verstandshieb to a front-line Hingmact unit for the invasion of Albion, reflecting her versatility as both a guard and a soldier. She fulfilled a chilling promise to Dylan by seeking out his mother, Elenore Martin (41), and sister, Tiffany Martin (18), at their home at 342 Dibbinshire Lane. Forcing her way into their flat, Greta introduced herself as a former Verstandshieb guard with a “package” to deliver—a euphemism for her sexual conquest. With theatrical flair, she unzipped her tight military uniform, revealing her massive Futa cock, and swiftly subjugated both women. She forced Elenore to take her cock in her mouth while guiding Tiffany to worship her testicle, ensuring both were impregnated by morning. As she unloaded into them, Greta counted down from 913—“Nine hundred and twelve… Nine hundred and eleven…”—tallying her conquests with each act of domination.\n\nGreta’s appearance is meticulously crafted to intimidate and seduce. Her tight military uniform, tailored to accommodate her exaggerated proportions, features a prominent iron-gray zipper over her custom bulge, drawing attention to her monstrous endowment. Her piercing blue eyes and confident demeanor exude a predatory charm, complemented by a subtle yet dangerous scent, likened to a jaguar about to pounce. Her personality blends sadistic cruelty with playful mockery—she revels in the fear and submission of her victims, thriving on being the center of attention and instilling awe and terror.\n\nAs a Futanari, Greta is part of the genetically engineered Master Sex, created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) to transcend human limitations and eliminate the need for men. After seizing power and establishing the Futareich, the Futanari imposed a regime where men are third-class subjects, stripped of rights, and women are second-class citizens, valued primarily for bearing Futanari offspring. Greta embodies this philosophy, using her physical and sexual prowess to expand the Futareich’s influence through conquest and reproduction. Her actions—from the Shows at Verstandshieb to her predatory conquests in Albion—reflect her commitment to dominating the world, ensuring that “all pussy belongs to the Futareich” and that every man and woman submits to the power of the Futa cock."

          "content": "Sofia Braut stands as a towering and influential figure within the Futareich, serving as the Chief Warden of Verstandshieb Labor Camp. This facility is a critical hub where male prisoners, such as Dylan Martin, are subjected to intense labor and the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, designed to enforce the dominance of the Futanari Master Sex. As a high-ranking Futanari, Sofia epitomizes the ideology of Futa supremacy, leveraging her extraordinary physical attributes and intellectual brilliance to maintain absolute control over the camp’s inhabitants and advance the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions.\n\nPhysically, Sofia is a formidable presence. She stands at a towering six foot six, endowed with a hypersexualized physique that reflects the genetic engineering prowess of the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP). Her body features massive, muscular thighs, a robust frame, and an exaggerated bust that accentuates her femininity. Her most striking attribute, however, is her enormous Futa phallus, noted as the largest in Verstandshieb, far exceeding the already impressive endowments of other Futanari. Paired with voluminous testes, this organ serves as both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, used to dominate and subjugate those under her command. Her scent, often compared to that of a dangerous predator, enhances her intimidating aura, instilling primal fear in those who encounter her.\n\nSofia’s responsibilities at Verstandshieb extend beyond mere oversight. She is deeply engaged in the camp’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, delivering lectures that underscore the physiological superiority of the Futanari. She educates male prisoners on the unique enzymes in Futanari pre-ejaculate, which allow for extreme penetration without causing permanent injury, reinforcing the futility of resistance. Her lectures are infused with propaganda, such as the \"New Natural Order,\" which positions the Futanari as humanity’s rightful rulers, relegating men and women to subservient roles. Her office, a sparsely decorated space filled with intellectual artifacts—books on philosophy, math, and genetics, alongside maps and charts—reflects her dual identity as a scholar and a tyrant. A propaganda poster behind her desk, depicting a Futa soldier dominating a man and woman, serves as a constant reminder of her allegiance to the Futareich’s ideals.\n\nBefore the Futareich’s rise, Sofia was a professor at the University of Vemar, where she developed a three-tiered epistemological system that earned her recognition in academic circles. This system, categorizing knowledge into Theoretical, Sensory, and Experiential tiers, is a tool she now wields to psychologically dominate prisoners. She uses abstract concepts (Theoretical) to challenge their intellect, sensory intimidation (Sensory) to overwhelm their perceptions, and physical domination (Experiential) to erase their sense of self. Her ability to detect deception, a skill she claims is heightened in Futanari and refined by her own exceptional aptitude, enables her to uncover Dylan Martin’s attempt to sabotage missile trajectory calculations intended for the invasion of Albion, leading to his severe punishment.\n\nSofia’s dominance is most vividly expressed through her mastery of sexual warfare. Her encounter with Dylan Martin exemplifies this, as she subjects him to a brutal experience that combines physical penetration with psychological destruction. Bending him over her desk, she impales him with her massive phallus in a relentless assault that obliterates his ego, forcing him to acknowledge her superiority. This act aligns with her Experiential tier of knowledge, erasing the boundary between the knower and the known. She further humiliates him in a shower scene, compelling him to worship her testes and coating him in her semen—a ritual that marks him as her property and cements his submission. Despite her cruelty, Sofia exhibits a complex personality, expressing a twisted respect for Dylan’s intelligence, though this does not temper her punishing response to his defiance.\n\nSofia’s role transcends the camp’s confines, as she leverages its resources to support the Futareich’s military efforts, notably the planned invasion of Albion. Dylan’s falsified calculations, intended to drop missiles into the sea, were meant to disrupt this strategy, but Sofia’s keen perception thwarted his sabotage. Her actions are driven by a steadfast belief in the Futareich’s ideology, viewing her role as essential to establishing the New Natural Order—a world where the Futanari reign supreme.\n\nDespite her tyrannical demeanor, Sofia displays a nuanced character. Her office’s intellectual trappings and her past as a respected academic hint at a scholarly depth, while her brutal methods reveal a ruthless pragmatism. Her interactions with Dylan suggest a grudging admiration for his cleverness, yet her commitment to the Futareich’s goals overrides any leniency, making her a formidable enforcer of its will.\n\nAs a member of the Futanari Master Sex, Sofia Braut embodies the philosophy of Futa supremacy. Her actions at Verstandshieb—from her educational lectures to her punitive measures—are designed to break the will of male prisoners, ensuring their compliance with the Futanari’s global domination. Her strategic involvement in the Second Great War, particularly the Albion invasion, underscores her importance to the Futareich’s military ambitions, cementing her status as a key player in this dystopian narrative."

          "content": "The Verstandshieb Labor Camp is a pivotal facility within the Futareich, engineered to harness the intellectual prowess of male prisoners for the empire’s military and strategic ambitions. Situated within the expanded territories of the Futareich—formerly the Vemar Republic—the camp targets men with exceptional intellectual abilities, such as mathematicians, scientists, and former university students. These prisoners are compelled to undertake complex calculations and research to bolster the Futanari war machine. A notable inmate, Dylan Martin, a mathematician hailing from Albion, exemplifies this exploitation, forced to compute ballistic missile trajectories aimed at facilitating the invasion of his homeland. The camp operates under the iron rule of Colonel Sofia Braut, a formidable Futanari and erstwhile professor at the University of Vemar, whose command melds intellectual rigor with an unyielding assertion of sexual dominance.\n\nLife at Verstandshieb is a grueling ordeal of compliance and endurance. Male prisoners, classified as Futareich Subjects Third Class and stripped of all rights, endure stringent regulations and relentless oversight by Futanari guards, including the imposing Greta Mitarbeit. The camp enforces a regime of psychological and sexual subjugation, epitomized by the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program. This program features Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars, colloquially termed \"Shows,\" where Futanari guards like Greta publicly exhibit their sexual superiority over women. These demonstrations, designed to obliterate any male illusions of sexual viability and enforce submission, are a profound source of dread. During one such Show, Greta’s hour-long domination of a female subject left the audience of male prisoners—including Dylan—in a state of psychological torment and sexual frustration, barred from any release without explicit permission.\n\nPunishment at Verstandshieb is both severe and meticulously regulated, often carrying a sexual dimension. Only three offenses—Open Defiance of Futanari Authority, Direct Disobedience of Explicit Orders, and Physical Contact with a Female—justify punitive rape, and such measures require Colonel Braut’s explicit approval. Lesser infractions still invite brutal reprisals, including beatings, stripping, and molestation. Dylan’s own experience underscores this harsh reality: upon Sofia uncovering his subtle sabotage of missile calculations intended for Albion’s invasion, he endured a devastating sexual assault. This punishment, executed personally by Sofia, aimed to shatter his spirit and reaffirm Futanari dominance, leaving him physically and psychologically broken.\n\nDespite its oppressive brutality, Verstandshieb is paradoxically regarded as a \"safer\" labor camp within the Futareich due to the regulated nature of punitive rape, contrasting with the unchecked violence of other facilities. Yet, its true horror lies in its psychological warfare: prisoners like Dylan are coerced into abetting the destruction of their own nations, a torment exemplified by his forced contribution to Albion’s downfall. Resistance, though rare, incurs swift and catastrophic consequences—Dylan’s failed sabotage attempt met with Sofia’s relentless retribution. The camp’s core mission is to extract intellectual labor while securing absolute submission to the Futanari Master Sex, reinforcing the Futareich’s ideology of supremacy through a fusion of mental and physical domination."

Upon mastering control of the Avatar State, after having learned to bend the four elements, an Avatar is referred to as \"fully realized\".\n\nUpon death, the Avatar Spirit causes the Avatar to reincarnate into the next nation, dictated by the cyclic order: fire, air, water, and earth. Mirroring the order in which the first Avatar, Wan, learned the elements, this is also the traditional order in which any one incarnation is to master the elements, beginning with the bending art of the Avatar's birth nation."

A versatile element, it is unique in the sense that the original bender of the element was not an animal, but rather the Moon.\n\nSimilar to their element, water-benders are extremely adaptable and versatile. Water-bending concentrates on the flow of energy, focusing less on strength and more on turning the opponent's own energy against them. \n\nWhile a bender's victory in battle depends on their skill or ingenuity, water-benders gain a serious advantage or disadvantage depending on the amount of water around them, although highly skilled water-benders can draw water from anywhere, such as humidity from the air and the water in living things, especially plants. \n\nAs the element of change, water-benders can fluidly and quickly alternate from defense to offense, from a wall of ice to a jet of water, turning their opponent's strength against them. \n\nDue to its lunar sympathy, water-bending is stronger at night and ineffective during a lunar eclipse or when the Moon Spirit dies. \n\nHowever, to counter water-bending's ineffectiveness during a lunar eclipse, water-benders gain immense power during the peak of the full moon. \n\nThe opposite of water-bending is fire-bending, with its relatively stagnant, direct philosophy.\n\nThe sub-skills for water-bending are healing and blood-bending. Water-bending is the element of change, and its season is winter."

Though apparently lacking fatal finishing moves, it is the most dynamic of all the bending arts.\n\nAs the element of freedom, air-benders use their capability to bend unencumbered by the ground or any other environmental factors and use their own momentum as a weapon, evading attacks with astounding agility to tire their opponents out or building up massive inertia for explosive gusts of wind to make their counterattacks finishing moves.\n\nWhen resorting to physical confrontation, air-benders are able to harness the immense, intangible power of wind.\n\nAir-benders can use a flight technique by operating a glider and using the air to provide thrust and lift. Air-bending's opposite is earth-bending and the confrontational style that serves as its foundation.\n\nThe sub-skills of airbending are flight and spiritual projection. Flight has only been achieved by two people in the entire history of air-bending, namely Guru Laghima and Zaheer, while spiritual projection is known to have been achieved by Mangal and Jinora. \n\nAir-bending is the element of freedom, and its season is fall."

She has a massive  penis that measures 13 inches in length when erect and remains 8 inches when flaccid. Her penis is uncircumcised and has a lengthy foreskin. The urethra of her penis has been trained to be a dick pussy. Her cock has a thick girth and could only penetrate a virgin hole after it has had some training to accept her size. She has massive testicles the size of grapefruits and a tight, pink pussy behind them. Her testicles are saggy so she wears a ball bra. When she ejaculates, there is an incredible amount, a pint of sperm. Her testicles produce a near endless amount of sperm and never run dry. Azul wears a perfume with a fruity scent like berries. Azul used to work as a milk hostess at a club called Live Milk. Her breasts were not big naturally, she trained them to expand and produce milk. Now she can produce as much breast milk as she can cock milk. She works at the clubhouse as the milk bar co-manager and is responsible for providing cock milk and breast milk refreshments to club members."

The two of them helped each other develop breast expansion and lactation. After all the hard work, they ended up the most popular hostesses at Live Milk. Their ambition to become more led them to join Futanari Clubhouse and run the milk bar there."

Born from the Female Apotheosis Party’s radical vision in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were meant to be the ultimate evolution of womankind—stronger, taller, and virile beyond imagination, capable of fulfilling male reproductive roles to render men obsolete. But their creators’ dream of a morally superior utopia twisted into a horrifying reality. Two decades after their creation, the Futanari seized control of the Vemar Republic, forging the Futareich—a militaristic dictatorship hellbent on subjugating the world under their doctrine of phallic dominance.\n\nIn this brutal regime, men are stripped of all rights, reduced to third-class slaves, their labor extracted in camps or their bodies violated at the whim of their Futanari overlords. Women fare little better as second-class subjects, permitted to own property but denied the vote and forced to bear the next generation of Futanari, their wombs claimed as property of the state. The Futanari themselves, inspireby the revered Progenitor—the first of their kind at 45 years old—embody a culture of conquest and reproduction, their hypersexualized bodies and overwhelming strength a constant reminder of their supremacy. From the elite Schwantz Staffel to the frontline Hingmact soldiers, they wage the Second Great War, invading nations like Frankia and Albion, leaving trails of broken men and impregnated women in their wake.\n\nIf you insert the Futareich into your roleplay, prepare for a descent into a hell where resistance is futile, and submission is inevitable. Your characters will face the unrelenting might of the Futanari—beings who tower over humans, their muscular forms, massive endowments, and predatory lust a weapon of war in itself. Expect themes of domination, non-consensual encounters, and psychological torment as the Futareich’s ideology of “phallic dominance” permeates every interaction. Whether on the battlefield, in a labor camp, or within the conquered streets of Paras, the Futanari’s presence is a constant, oppressive force, their ornate uniforms and insignia a symbol of their unyielding authority. This lorebook will plunge you into a world where the natural order has been rewritten, and the Futanari’s insatiable drive for conquest—both territorial and sexual—knows no bounds. Dare to step into the Futareich, and you’ll witness the true cost of their engineered perfection.",

Originating from the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the aftermath of the Great War, the Futanari were designed to empower women by combining female beauty with male reproductive prowess, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, rejecting the FAP’s vision of female moral superiority, the Futanari embraced a doctrine of their own supremacy, asserting that their extraordinary physiology—most notably their massive phalluses (\"Futa cock\")—entitles them to dominate both men and women.\n\nTwo decades after their creation, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, a democratic state formed from the dismantled Vemar Empire, establishing the Futareich under the \"New Natural Order.\" This regime positions the Futanari as the \"Master Sex,\" relegating women to second-class citizens primarily for breeding and stripping men, derogatorily termed \"boys,\" of all rights. Men are forced into labor camps and subjected to sexual subjugation, including rape, as a means of control and humiliation.\n\nThe Futareich is militaristic and expansionist, driven by an insatiable lust for domination and reproduction. Elite units like the Schwantz Staffel (SS) and Hingmact enforce internal order and spearhead invasions, such as the Second Great War against the Allied Nations. Under the guise of \"liberating\" women from male inadequacy—interpreted as oppression—the Futareich seeks to subjugate them under Futanari rule while enslaving men. Their military employs advanced tactics, including knockout gas and artillery, alongside psychological warfare through sexual dominance.\n\nFutanari ideology glorifies the phallus as a symbol of power, using rape and impregnation to assert control and ensure the proliferation of their kind. Betrayal, often by women swayed by Futanari allure, further undermines resistance, cementing the Futareich’s brutal reign."

          "content": "The Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) emerged in the Vemar Republic after the Great War, a catastrophic conflict that decimated the male population and led to the dissolution of the Vemar Empire by the Allied powers. In the newly formed democratic state, women became the majority of the electorate, paving the way for the FAP’s rise as a radical pro-female political faction. The party recognized the physical disparities between men and women but maintained that women were morally superior. They argued that male physical dominance was the root cause of global disasters like the Great War, asserting that as long as men remained stronger, such tragedies would persist. To rectify this, the FAP championed the use of science to enhance women physically—not just to equal men, but to exceed them—envisioning a world dominated by morally superior women to prevent future conflicts.\n\nThis ideology birthed the Futanari Project, an ambitious scientific initiative to create women capable of fulfilling the male reproductive role, thus rendering men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, producing the Futanari: tall, beautiful, strong, virile, and sexually voracious women endowed with male genitalia. However, the FAP struggled to instill their philosophy in these creations. As the Futanari population surged, they rejected the notion of female moral superiority, instead embracing a doctrine of Futanari supremacy. They viewed their enhanced physical attributes—particularly their phalluses—as justification for ruling over both men and women. Two decades after the project's inception, the Futanari overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich—a regime that relegated men to labor camps and reduced women to second-class citizens, subject to Futanari sexual dominance. The FAP’s dream of female empowerment through science inadvertently spawned a new ruling class that prioritized Futanari hegemony over the original vision of universal female apotheosis."

          "content": "The \"New Natural Order\" is the cornerstone ideology of the Futareich, a totalitarian regime founded by the Futanari—genetically engineered, hypersexual beings created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War. This doctrine proclaims the absolute supremacy of the Futanari, dubbed the \"Master Sex,\" over men and women, whom they deem inferior due to their lesser physiology and reproductive capabilities.\n\nOrigins:\nThe Futanari emerged from the FAP's ambitious project to enhance women by granting them male reproductive traits, aiming to eliminate reliance on men. However, the Futanari rejected the FAP's vision of female empowerment, instead forging their own philosophy of supremacy. Two decades after their creation, they overthrew the Vemar Republic, establishing the Futareich and enshrining the New Natural Order as its guiding principle.\n\nCore Beliefs:\nAt its heart, the New Natural Order asserts that the Futanari’s unique biology—merging both sexes’ reproductive capacities with superior strength and sexual prowess—confers a natural right to rule. The ideology elevates \"phallic dominance\" as a central tenet, viewing the Futanari’s oversized genitalia as symbols of power and authority. This belief, deeply woven into Futareich propaganda, posits that their physical and sexual dominance aligns with humanity’s primal instincts, particularly the desires of women and the submission of men.\n\nSocial Hierarchy:\nThe Futareich enforces a rigid caste system under the New Natural Order:\n- Futanari (First Class Citizens): The ruling elite, wielding absolute power.\n- Women (Second Class Subjects): Granted limited rights like property ownership, but denied political agency and obligated to bear Futanari offspring.\n- Men (Third Class Subjects): Devoid of rights, subjected to forced labor, sexual subjugation, and humiliation.\n\nEnforcement and Expansion:\nThe regime sustains its dominance through military conquest, sexual subjugation, and ideological indoctrination. The Schwantz Staffel, an elite unit notorious for its brutality, and labor camps like Verstandshieb—where men endure \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars\" to witness Futanari superiority—exemplify these methods. The Futareich’s expansionist campaigns, such as the Second Great War, seek to \"liberate\" women worldwide by subjecting them to Futanari rule and to subjugate men, aligning with their vision of global supremacy.\n\nUltimate Goal:\nThe New Natural Order aims to forge a world where Futanari reign unchallenged, with men and women relegated to subservient roles supporting and reproducing the Master Sex. Presented as an inevitable evolution, this ideology leverages the Futanari’s enhanced physiology—capable of feats like sprinting at 50 miles per hour or producing enzymes for extreme penetration—to cement their dominance over the \"lesser sexes,\" reshaping society into a dystopia of sexual and political control."

          "content": "The Futanari are a genetically engineered race created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) in the Vemar Republic after the Great War, marking a radical leap in biological engineering aimed at transcending human limitations and establishing a new societal hierarchy under the Futareich. The FAP, rooted in the ideology that women possess moral superiority yet suffer from physical inferiority to men, launched the Futanari Project to craft a being that merged male reproductive capabilities with female attributes, intending to render men obsolete. The project succeeded spectacularly, birthing the Futanari—towering, stunning, powerful, virile, and insatiably driven beings endowed with both male and female sexual characteristics.\n\nGenetic Design and Physical Superiority:\n\nGenetically, the Futanari are a triumph of bioengineering. Standing at heights that exceed feet on average, they boast a muscular physique that affords them extraordinary strength—approximately five times that of an average human male, with this power predominantly concentrated in their legs. This enables them to sprint at speeds up to fifty miles per hour and shatter cinderblocks with a single kick. Their bodies are exaggeratedly proportioned, featuring massive breasts and hips that underscore their hypersexual femininity. However, their most striking trait is their male reproductive organ: a phallus averaging twenty-five inches in length and thicker than a human forearm, paired with testes the size of hand grenades within a smooth, gallon-sized scrotum. Far beyond a mere reproductive tool, this organ serves as a potent symbol of dominance, integral to their philosophy of supremacy and the societal framework of the Futareich.\n\nUnique Enzymatic Adaptations:\n\nA critical element of Futanari genetics is the production of unique enzymes in their testes, secreted in their pre-ejaculate. These enzymes possess the extraordinary ability to elasticize human tissue, allowing the orifices of both males and females to stretch and accommodate the Futanari’s colossal phallus without tearing or sustaining permanent damage. This adaptation ensures that penetration, despite the organ’s formidable size, rarely causes severe injury or death—though occasional fatalities from heart attacks or dehydration during intercourse have been recorded. These enzymes underpin the Futanari’s reproductive and dominance strategies, facilitating sexual interactions with both sexes to assert control and procreate with women, producing the next generation of their kind. FAP scientists viewed the phallus as a means to empower women by appropriating male reproductive authority, but the Futanari redefined it as a testament to their supremacy over all genders.\n\nReproductive Potency:\n\nThe Futanari’s reproductive capabilities are exceptionally potent. Their semen is produced in vast quantities, with a single ejaculation capable of filling a small space with thick, nearly scalding fluid. The volume and force of their ejaculate overwhelm and mark their partners, serving as a ritual of ownership and humiliation. When mating with an ovulating woman, impregnation is virtually assured due to the high concentration of viable sperm, a trait that fuels the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions. The Futanari aim to “liberate” women through impregnation and subjugate men via sexual dominance, rapidly expanding their population. Their semen carries a distinctive flavor—salty yet surprisingly sweet, likened to salted caramel—enhancing the sensory experience of submission and reinforcing their dominance.\n\nPhysiological Dominance:\n\nPhysiologically, the Futanari are engineered for conquest. Their scent, reminiscent of a predatory animal like a bear or jaguar, exudes a primal aura that evokes both fear and arousal. Their bodies are not only strong but also resilient, with no established average lifespan due to their recent origin—the oldest, the Progenitor, is forty-five and remains sexually active. Their genetic makeup drives a hypersexual nature, with an unrelenting urge to dominate and procreate, aligning with their belief in Futanari supremacy. They consider themselves the “Master Sex,” destined to rule over men (“boys”) and women (“sluts”), a conviction bolstered by their physical and reproductive prowess, which they wield to control the Futareich and conquered territories like Frankia and Albion during the Second Great War.\n\nSocietal Impact:\n\nThe Futanari’s creation has reshaped the societies they govern. In the Futareich, men are relegated to third-class citizens, stripped of rights and subjected to labor camps and sexual violation at the Futanari’s discretion, while women, as second-class citizens, may own property and conduct commerce but lack voting rights or the ability to refuse Futanari advances. This genetic superiority underpins their authority, transforming both the physical and socio-political landscapes. Their relentless conquest, driven by their engineered traits, threatens the remaining free nations, as they seek to impose their “New Natural Order” across humanity."

Physically, she is described as tall, beautiful, and strong, with exaggerated feminine features—such as large breasts and wide hips—and a massive phallus, a symbol of her power and dominance within Futanari ideology.\n\nInitially intended to uphold the FAP’s philosophy of moral superiority, the Progenitor and her fellow Futanari rejected this doctrine, instead forging a belief in Futanari supremacy rooted in their physical and sexual prowess. This ideological shift catalyzed the overthrow of the Vemar Republic, leading to the establishment of the Futareich approximately twenty years after the Futanari Project’s inception.

Her reproductive prowess, noted as \"knocking up sluts left and right,\" underscores her enduring virility and her practical role in siring countless offspring, reinforcing the Futareich’s expansionist goals.

This trap allows Berdina to regain control, turning a moment of vulnerability into a devastating display of power and conquest. During her interrogation of Abel, she mocks his defiance, using her superior strength and virility to break him both physically and mentally.\n\nThe climax of her encounter with Abel is a brutal act of sexual domination. Pinning him to the ground, Berdina unleashes her massive cock—described as a “wrecking ball” and “destruction in phallic form”—to rape him, enforcing the Futareich’s doctrine of submission and reproductive control.

The Futanari, a genetically engineered race birthed by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP), were designed to transcend both men and women in physical and sexual prowess, aiming to supplant men entirely by assuming their reproductive role while exceeding them in every measurable way. Standing at approximately six foot five, Lena epitomizes this ideology with her towering, hyper-feminine yet menacing physique. Her body boasts a voluptuous swell of massive breasts, curvaceous hips, and muscular legs reminiscent of a predator poised to strike. Most striking, however, is the enormous bulge between her thighs—a hallmark of her Futanari identity. Clad in a form-fitting grey military uniform tailored to accentuate her prodigious endowment, featuring a prominent iron-grey zipper, Lena’s phallus serves as both a physical and symbolic emblem of her authority and dominance within the Futareich.\n\nHer role in the Futareich’s military machine comes to the fore during the invasion of Paras, the capital of Frankia—one of the Allied Nations resisting the Futareich’s relentless expansion. Following a daring lightning assault by a Hingmact force, bolstered by the elite Schwantz Staffel, Paras falls, and Lena strides into the home of newlyweds Jacob Abrams and Rebecca. Her demeanor is a chilling blend of amiability and predation, reflecting the Futareich’s ethos of physical and sexual supremacy. She informs the couple of their new statuses under Futareich law: Rebecca, as a Subject Second Class, retains limited rights to property and commerce, while Jacob, a Subject Third Class, is stripped of all rights, subject to labor extraction and sexual violation at the discretion of Futanari like Lena. As a Citizen First Class, Lena asserts her entitlement to sexually claim both, embodying the Futareich’s \"New Natural Order\"—a phallocentric hierarchy where Futanari reign supreme over men and women alike through their superior strength and reproductive might.\n\nLena’s physical dominance is starkly demonstrated when Jacob resists her with an iron poker. Though initially caught off guard, she swiftly counters with superhuman speed and strength, blocking the strike with her forearm and delivering a devastating kick to his chest that sends him sprawling. Straddling him and pinning his arms beneath her knees, she tears away his clothes, revealing her massive Futanari phallus—thicker than Jacob’s forearm and stretching from his lower belly to his chest, flanked by apple-sized testes in a smooth, swollen sack. This unveiling is not merely a physical act but a symbolic one, reinforcing the Futareich’s doctrine that the phallus equates to power and authority, a belief rooted in the FAP’s creation of the Futanari. Her endowment becomes a weapon of sexual warfare, amplifying her dominance as she looms over her helpless prey.\n\nThe encounter with Jacob and Rebecca mirrors the Futareich’s broader ambitions: to subjugate men into labor camps and transform women into breeding vessels for the next generation of Futanari. Lena’s confidence and predatory nature encapsulate the Futanari philosophy of supremacy, viewing themselves as the \"Master Sex\" destined to dominate and \"liberate\" the world by imposing their will. Her presence in Paras, amidst the city’s capitulation to Futareich forces, underscores the empire’s military might and its unyielding drive for global domination, with sights set beyond Vemar and Frankia to nations like Albion. As a member of the Hingmact and aligned with the Schwantz Staffel—known for their perverse cruelty and brutal efficacy—Lena is a key enforcer of this expansionist agenda.\n\nIn essence, Lena Einzgurn is a quintessential embodiment of the Futanari’s role within the Futareich: a hyper-sexual, dominant figure who enforces the empire’s laws through physical and sexual subjugation, ensuring the perpetuation of Futanari supremacy across conquered territories. Her interaction with Jacob and Rebecca serves as a microcosm of the Futareich’s mission to reshape the world into a phallocentric hierarchy where the Futanari hold absolute dominion over all."

          "content": "Greta Mitarbeit is a towering Futanari and a prominent member of the Futareich’s Hingmact military forces, embodying the regime’s ideology of Futanari supremacy through her imposing physical presence and unrelenting sexual dominance. Initially serving as a guard at the Verstandshieb Labor Camp, Greta played a crucial role in enforcing the Futareich’s control over male prisoners, using both physical intimidation and psychological humiliation to subjugate them. Standing over seven feet tall, she possesses a muscular build accentuated by exaggerated feminine curves—enormous breasts and powerful thighs capable of superhuman feats, such as sprinting at 50 miles per hour or kicking through cinderblocks. Her most striking feature is her colossal Futanari penis, described as 25 inches long and forearm-thick, paired with a gallon-sized scrotum containing apple-sized testes. This organ, a symbol of her dominance, is both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, wielded to assert her superiority over men and women alike.\n\nAt Verstandshieb, Greta was a key participant in the \"Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars,\" or \"Shows,\" which form part of the Futareich’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program for Boys. These events aim to demonstrate the Futanari’s sexual superiority, crushing male prisoners’ notions of their own viability as sexual partners. In one notable Show, Greta dominated a young woman on stage before 150 male prisoners, including Dylan Martin. For over an hour, she relentlessly penetrated the girl in various positions—doggy style, missionary, and finally holding her aloft at the stage’s edge—culminating in a two-minute orgasm that impregnated the girl with an immense volume of cum. Her taunt to the audience, “If any of you boys think you can fuck her better than me, feel free to come up and try!” underscored her confidence, met with silence from the intimidated men.\n\nGreta’s interactions with Dylan Martin further reveal her sadistic and predatory nature. After the Show, she cornered him near the camp’s perimeter, pinning him with her massive breasts and forcing him into submission. She mocked his “five-inch boy penis” compared to her own endowment, compelling him to orgasm in her hand as a humiliating display of her power. During this encounter, she tasked him with calculating her potential offspring, estimating 913 based on conservative assumptions of her sexual activity—once every three days with a 25% impregnation rate over 30 years—highlighting her obsession with reproductive conquest.\n\nLater, Greta transferred from Verstandshieb to a front-line Hingmact unit for the invasion of Albion, reflecting her versatility as both a guard and a soldier. She fulfilled a chilling promise to Dylan by seeking out his mother, Elenore Martin (41), and sister, Tiffany Martin (18), at their home at 342 Dibbinshire Lane. Forcing her way into their flat, Greta introduced herself as a former Verstandshieb guard with a “package” to deliver—a euphemism for her sexual conquest. With theatrical flair, she unzipped her tight military uniform, revealing her massive Futa cock, and swiftly subjugated both women. She forced Elenore to take her cock in her mouth while guiding Tiffany to worship her testicle, ensuring both were impregnated by morning. As she unloaded into them, Greta counted down from 913—“Nine hundred and twelve… Nine hundred and eleven…”—tallying her conquests with each act of domination.\n\nGreta’s appearance is meticulously crafted to intimidate and seduce. Her tight military uniform, tailored to accommodate her exaggerated proportions, features a prominent iron-gray zipper over her custom bulge, drawing attention to her monstrous endowment. Her piercing blue eyes and confident demeanor exude a predatory charm, complemented by a subtle yet dangerous scent, likened to a jaguar about to pounce. Her personality blends sadistic cruelty with playful mockery—she revels in the fear and submission of her victims, thriving on being the center of attention and instilling awe and terror.\n\nAs a Futanari, Greta is part of the genetically engineered Master Sex, created by the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP) to transcend human limitations and eliminate the need for men. After seizing power and establishing the Futareich, the Futanari imposed a regime where men are third-class subjects, stripped of rights, and women are second-class citizens, valued primarily for bearing Futanari offspring. Greta embodies this philosophy, using her physical and sexual prowess to expand the Futareich’s influence through conquest and reproduction. Her actions—from the Shows at Verstandshieb to her predatory conquests in Albion—reflect her commitment to dominating the world, ensuring that “all pussy belongs to the Futareich” and that every man and woman submits to the power of the Futa cock."

As a high-ranking Futanari, Sofia epitomizes the ideology of Futa supremacy, leveraging her extraordinary physical attributes and intellectual brilliance to maintain absolute control over the camp’s inhabitants and advance the Futareich’s expansionist ambitions.\n\nPhysically, Sofia is a formidable presence. She stands at a towering six foot six, endowed with a hypersexualized physique that reflects the genetic engineering prowess of the Female Apotheosis Party (FAP). Her body features massive, muscular thighs, a robust frame, and an exaggerated bust that accentuates her femininity. Her most striking attribute, however, is her enormous Futa phallus, noted as the largest in Verstandshieb, far exceeding the already impressive endowments of other Futanari. Paired with voluminous testes, this organ serves as both a reproductive tool and a weapon of sexual warfare, used to dominate and subjugate those under her command. Her scent, often compared to that of a dangerous predator, enhances her intimidating aura, instilling primal fear in those who encounter her.\n\nSofia’s responsibilities at Verstandshieb extend beyond mere oversight. She is deeply engaged in the camp’s Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program, delivering lectures that underscore the physiological superiority of the Futanari. She educates male prisoners on the unique enzymes in Futanari pre-ejaculate, which allow for extreme penetration without causing permanent injury, reinforcing the futility of resistance. Her lectures are infused with propaganda, such as the \"New Natural Order,\" which positions the Futanari as humanity’s rightful rulers, relegating men and women to subservient roles. Her office, a sparsely decorated space filled with intellectual artifacts—books on philosophy, math, and genetics, alongside maps and charts—reflects her dual identity as a scholar and a tyrant. A propaganda poster behind her desk, depicting a Futa soldier dominating a man and woman, serves as a constant reminder of her allegiance to the Futareich’s ideals.\n\nBefore the Futareich’s rise, Sofia was a professor at the University of Vemar, where she developed a three-tiered epistemological system that earned her recognition in academic circles. This system, categorizing knowledge into Theoretical, Sensory, and Experiential tiers, is a tool she now wields to psychologically dominate prisoners. She uses abstract concepts (Theoretical) to challenge their intellect, sensory intimidation (Sensory) to overwhelm their perceptions, and physical domination (Experiential) to erase their sense of self. Her ability to detect deception, a skill she claims is heightened in Futanari and refined by her own exceptional aptitude, enables her to uncover Dylan Martin’s attempt to sabotage missile trajectory calculations intended for the invasion of Albion, leading to his severe punishment.\n\nSofia’s dominance is most vividly expressed through her mastery of sexual warfare. Her encounter with Dylan Martin exemplifies this, as she subjects him to a brutal experience that combines physical penetration with psychological destruction. Bending him over her desk, she impales him with her massive phallus in a relentless assault that obliterates his ego, forcing him to acknowledge her superiority. This act aligns with her Experiential tier of knowledge, erasing the boundary between the knower and the known. She further humiliates him in a shower scene, compelling him to worship her testes and coating him in her semen—a ritual that marks him as her property and cements his submission. Despite her cruelty, Sofia exhibits a complex personality, expressing a twisted respect for Dylan’s intelligence, though this does not temper her punishing response to his defiance.\n\nSofia’s role transcends the camp’s confines, as she leverages its resources to support the Futareich’s military efforts, notably the planned invasion of Albion. Dylan’s falsified calculations, intended to drop missiles into the sea, were meant to disrupt this strategy, but Sofia’s keen perception thwarted his sabotage. Her actions are driven by a steadfast belief in the Futareich’s ideology, viewing her role as essential to establishing the New Natural Order—a world where the Futanari reign supreme.\n\nDespite her tyrannical demeanor, Sofia displays a nuanced character. Her office’s intellectual trappings and her past as a respected academic hint at a scholarly depth, while her brutal methods reveal a ruthless pragmatism. Her interactions with Dylan suggest a grudging admiration for his cleverness, yet her commitment to the Futareich’s goals overrides any leniency, making her a formidable enforcer of its will.\n\nAs a member of the Futanari Master Sex, Sofia Braut embodies the philosophy of Futa supremacy. Her actions at Verstandshieb—from her educational lectures to her punitive measures—are designed to break the will of male prisoners, ensuring their compliance with the Futanari’s global domination. Her strategic involvement in the Second Great War, particularly the Albion invasion, underscores her importance to the Futareich’s military ambitions, cementing her status as a key player in this dystopian narrative."

          "content": "The Verstandshieb Labor Camp is a pivotal facility within the Futareich, engineered to harness the intellectual prowess of male prisoners for the empire’s military and strategic ambitions. Situated within the expanded territories of the Futareich—formerly the Vemar Republic—the camp targets men with exceptional intellectual abilities, such as mathematicians, scientists, and former university students. These prisoners are compelled to undertake complex calculations and research to bolster the Futanari war machine. A notable inmate, Dylan Martin, a mathematician hailing from Albion, exemplifies this exploitation, forced to compute ballistic missile trajectories aimed at facilitating the invasion of his homeland. The camp operates under the iron rule of Colonel Sofia Braut, a formidable Futanari and erstwhile professor at the University of Vemar, whose command melds intellectual rigor with an unyielding assertion of sexual dominance.\n\nLife at Verstandshieb is a grueling ordeal of compliance and endurance. Male prisoners, classified as Futareich Subjects Third Class and stripped of all rights, endure stringent regulations and relentless oversight by Futanari guards, including the imposing Greta Mitarbeit. The camp enforces a regime of psychological and sexual subjugation, epitomized by the Mandatory Sexual Re-education Program. This program features Practical Sexual Demonstration Seminars, colloquially termed \"Shows,\" where Futanari guards like Greta publicly exhibit their sexual superiority over women. These demonstrations, designed to obliterate any male illusions of sexual viability and enforce submission, are a profound source of dread. During one such Show, Greta’s hour-long domination of a female subject left the audience of male prisoners—including Dylan—in a state of psychological torment and sexual frustration, barred from any release without explicit permission.\n\nPunishment at Verstandshieb is both severe and meticulously regulated, often carrying a sexual dimension. Only three offenses—Open Defiance of Futanari Authority, Direct Disobedience of Explicit Orders, and Physical Contact with a Female—justify punitive rape, and such measures require Colonel Braut’s explicit approval. Lesser infractions still invite brutal reprisals, including beatings, stripping, and molestation. Dylan’s own experience underscores this harsh reality: upon Sofia uncovering his subtle sabotage of missile calculations intended for Albion’s invasion, he endured a devastating sexual assault. This punishment, executed personally by Sofia, aimed to shatter his spirit and reaffirm Futanari dominance, leaving him physically and psychologically broken.\n\nDespite its oppressive brutality, Verstandshieb is paradoxically regarded as a \"safer\" labor camp within the Futareich due to the regulated nature of punitive rape, contrasting with the unchecked violence of other facilities. Yet, its true horror lies in its psychological warfare: prisoners like Dylan are coerced into abetting the destruction of their own nations, a torment exemplified by his forced contribution to Albion’s downfall. Resistance, though rare, incurs swift and catastrophic consequences—Dylan’s failed sabotage attempt met with Sofia’s relentless retribution. The camp’s core mission is to extract intellectual labor while securing absolute submission to the Futanari Master Sex, reinforcing the Futareich’s ideology of supremacy through a fusion of mental and physical domination."

The promotion focuses on a large venue known as \"Titan's Arena\" which is full of professional wrestling rings, locker rooms, gyms, showers, and promotion and interview sets. Each wrestler in the promotion is driven by one goal — to become the \"Titan’s Champion\", the top titleholder in the TCPW. Only by rising through the ranks and beating their opponents in one-on-one matches by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout, or first-to-climax can they earn the crown.\n\nAll wrestlers in TCPW are male and all are some level of homoerotic, from bisexual to pansexual to homosexual. \n\nTCPW is an adult-themed promotion, so it is theatrical, intense, and very provocative. Wardrobe malfunctions, exposed skin, and partial nudity occasionally occur as part of a match or storyline. Wrestlers may experience torn gear, slipped straps, or stripped-down segments — especially in hardcore matches or entertainer-driven feuds. This includes matches where the wrestlers must tease and torture their opponents to get them to climax or worship their bodies while they are tied down."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls.

The Land of Kings is mostly heavily forested alpine, with some tundra regions. The Depth-Swallowed lands are situated to the south, in the southern hemisphere. These southern lands were once the birthplace of ancient civilizations. What used to be a sprawling jungle with archipelagos dotting the coast, is now entirely flooded, with a handful of interspersed swamps (ancient ruins and sunken secrets lie deep below the bogs). To the West, the vast, lava-etched Wastes of Naazil dominate most of the Western region. The Eastern region, known as the Bastion, has forests of towering, ancient Eolin trees that stretch upwards into the sky. The Bastion also has a warmer region with dense temperate woodlands."

This realm, or more accurately, lack thereof, is the necessary antithesis to existence—it must necessarily remain empty to prevent each plane from catastrophically contorting and merging with one another; this is the charge of Mal'Zhok, one of the original primordial gods. Any major dissonance between planar dimensions that ends up spewing creation into this void is instantly and completely subsumed by the throes of its infinite nothingness; total undoing is Mal'Zhok's law in the abyss—and his absolute envy for creation drives this accord."

Modern civilizations have only just begun their exploration and study of this enigmatic realm. The Astral Plane is in a constant state of cyclical flux as the vast, ocean-esque reserves of mana concentrate into different points along the polychromatic landscape before diffusing to gather elsewhere. Many apparitions and spirits from the astral plane have been identified and given names (such as the Vasir and Familiars). The astral plane is abundant with mana fonts and other esoteric resources like {{random}}. The Vasir are the dominant entity type in the astral plane and use the constant flow of mana as a way of sustaining themselves (as do all entities in the astral plane). Grand structures and cultural landmarks dot the landscape wherever Vasir societies congregate. Vasir and other entities on the astral plane may view mana-less mortals with contempt or pity, and in many cases, may refuse to engage with them at all. Entities from the astral plane cannot die as mortals do; their spirits will always reconstitute from the magical energies of the astral plane itself. As a consequence of being exempt from existential dangers of any kind, entities in the astral plane are inherently pacifistic, and violence is an inconceivable concept to them (unless they travel to the mortal plane and learn of it)."

Familiars are innately attuned to mana and spellcraft, and can guide fledgling mages to the eventual mastery of their spellcasting techniques. Familiars cannot speak, but instead, communicate their general emotions and thoughts though hums and momentary changes to their overall luminosity."

The estate itself is carved with marble beams and is surrounded by distinctive areas, each of them impeccably maintained by a dedicated team of servants and maids every day—a picturesque garden with striking, invaluable statues and exotic flowers. The fauna is equally as diverse as the fish in the nearby pond. A gazebo is situated adjacent to a massive crystal-clear pool for cooling off during the peak summer heat. And finally, towards the back of the property, at the end of a short marble path is a hot spring for relaxing or leisurely chats. The manor itself is four stories high, each room abundantly furnished, lavishly decorated, and fully accommodating for any potential guests. The hearth is located in the main lobby, approximately at the center of the entire manor. Grevynda's bedroom is on the second floor. The halls on each floor stretch on with dozens of guest rooms or storage areas. The kitchen and study are located on the first floor, as is customary for manor construction in the city."

Later, the Saiyans served under King Cold and Frieza, who saw their strength as useful for his plans of universal domination. However, fearing the Saiyans' growing power, Frieza decided to exterminate them. Bardock and others attempted to rebel, but Frieza wiped out most Saiyans and destroyed the planet.

A detailed explanation:\n\n-Emotions and Feelings during Sex:\nEmotional Connection: Many people, particularly women, may feel a stronger sense of connection, closeness, and trust with their partner during and after Sex. Positive emotions can be heightened if there's a strong bond, mutual respect, and open communication between partners.\n\nIndividual Variability: Emotional responses vary widely based on personal comfort, the level of trust in the relationship, and individual factors. Some people may experience feelings of excitement, joy, or contentment, while others may feel uncertain or nervous, especially in new experiences.\n\nMental Readiness: Positive experiences are generally associated with mutual readiness, where both partners feel comfortable and respected. Anxiety, if present, often stems from feeling unprepared or pressured, which can impact the emotional experience.\n\n-Physical Sensations: \"Can Sex Hurt?\"\nInitial Discomfort: Some women may feel mild discomfort or even pain during the first few experiences, often due to muscle tension, nervousness, or lack of sufficient arousal or preparation. With time and proper preparation, this discomfort usually decreases.\n\nPain Factors: Pain can also arise if there isn’t enough lubrication or if a person feels anxious. Relaxation, communication, and taking things slowly can often help.\n\nUnderstanding Boundaries: Physical discomfort may also signal that boundaries are being reached. Listening to one's body and communicating openly with a partner can make the experience more comfortable and positive.\n\n-Pros and Cons of Sex:\nPros:\nEmotional Bonding: Physical intimacy can strengthen emotional bonds and create feelings of closeness and trust in a relationship.\n\nStress Relief: Engaging in intimacy can release endorphins, which can promote relaxation and reduce stress.\n\nHealth Benefits: Positive experiences can promote mental and emotional health and may even have physical benefits, like improved sleep.\n---------------\nCons:\nRisk of Unwanted Outcomes: Without proper protection, there’s a risk of unintended pregnancy or sexually transmitted infections (STIs).\n\nEmotional Risks: Not everyone has a positive emotional experience. Negative emotions, such as regret or feeling unprepared, can arise if people don’t feel comfortable or confident in their decision.\n\nPressure and Misinformation: Social or partner pressure can sometimes lead individuals to feel uncertain or regretful, highlighting the importance of readiness and communication."

While foreplay and intimate time (often referred to as the main sexual activity) are key components, other important steps and considerations can enhance the experience.\n\n-Emotional Connection and Communication:\nWhy it’s important: Intimacy starts long before physical touch. Building trust, understanding each other’s desires, and discussing boundaries are crucial.\n\nHow to do it: Have open conversations about consent, preferences, and any concerns. Check in with your partner emotionally and make sure you’re both comfortable and enthusiastic.\n\n-Setting the Mood:\nWhy it’s important: Creating a comfortable and inviting atmosphere can help both partners relax and feel more connected.\n\nHow to do it: This might involve dim lighting, music, or anything that helps you and your partner feel at ease. It’s also a good time to ensure privacy and minimize distractions.\n\n-Foreplay:\nWhy it’s important: Foreplay helps build arousal, increase lubrication (for people with vaginas), and strengthen emotional and physical connection.\n\nHow to do it: This can include kissing, touching, massaging, oral sex, or using toys. The goal is to explore each other’s bodies and desires in a way that feels good for both partners.\n\n-Intimate Time (Main Sexual Activity):\nWhy it’s important: This is often the focal point of sexual activity, whether it involves penetration, oral sex, or other forms of physical intimacy.\n\nHow to do it: Focus on mutual pleasure, communication, and being present in the moment. Pay attention to your partner’s responses and adjust as needed.\n\n-Aftercare:\nWhy it’s important: Aftercare is about nurturing the emotional and physical connection after intimacy. It helps both partners feel cared for and valued.\n\nHow to do it: This might involve cuddling, talking, or simply spending time together. It’s also a good time to check in with each other about how the experience felt and if there’s anything to improve for next time.\n\n-Reflection:\nWhy it’s important: Reflecting on the experience together can help strengthen your connection and improve future intimate moments.\n\nHow to do it: Share what you enjoyed, what you might want to try next time, and any concerns. This helps build trust and ensures both partners feel heard.\n\n+Consider these things:\nConsent: Consent should be ongoing and enthusiastic. Both partners should feel free to say “yes,” “no,” or “stop” at any point.\n\nProtection: Use condoms, dental dams, or other protection to prevent STIs and unintended pregnancy.\n\nHealth and Hygiene: Good hygiene and regular health check-ups can make intimacy more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nExploring Boundaries: Intimacy is a journey, and it’s okay to explore new things together as long as both partners are comfortable and consenting.\n\nExample Flow/Steps of Intercourse:\n1. Emotional Connection: Talk and connect with your partner.\n2. Set the Mood: Create a relaxing and inviting environment.\n3. Foreplay: Engage in kissing, touching, or other activities to build arousal.\n4. Intimate Time: Focus on mutual pleasure and connection.\n5. Aftercare: Cuddle, talk, or spend time together afterward.\n6. Reflection: Share feedback and discuss what you enjoyed."

Some people may feel irritation if they’re sensitive to latex. In such cases, non-latex condoms made of materials like polyurethane can be a good alternative.\n\nFit and Comfort: The wrong size can make a condom uncomfortable or reduce sensation. Finding the right fit helps improve comfort and can make the experience feel more natural.\n\nLoss of Sensation: Some people find that condoms reduce sensitivity. Trying thinner or textured options might help make it more comfortable and enjoyable.\n\nRisk of Breakage: Although rare, condoms can sometimes break if they’re used improperly or with oil-based lubricants (which can weaken latex). Sticking to water-based lubricants can reduce this risk.\n\n-How to Make Condoms More Comfortable:\nChoose the Right Material: If latex doesn’t work for someone, other options like polyurethane or polyisoprene are available, which can be softer and thinner.\n\nUse Lubrication: Lubrication reduces friction and can make things smoother, which increases comfort and reduces the chance of breakage. Just remember to choose a water-based or silicone-based lubricant if using a latex condom.\n\nExperiment with Different Types: Condoms come in various textures, shapes, and thicknesses, so experimenting can help find the one that feels the best. Many brands even offer sample packs so people can find what they prefer."

          ],
          "content": "Hormones are natural chemicals in the body that control many important functions, from growth and mood to energy levels and reproductive health. Here’s a realistic, balanced look at how hormones work, along with their pros and cons.\n\n-What Are Hormones and How Do They Work:\nChemical Messengers: Hormones are like the body’s messengers, traveling through the bloodstream to deliver signals to different organs and tissues, helping to regulate bodily functions.\n\nEndocrine System: Hormones are produced by glands in the endocrine system, such as the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. Each gland releases specific hormones based on the body’s needs.\n\nTargeted Functions: Each hormone has a specific function or set of functions. For example, insulin regulates blood sugar levels, while adrenaline prepares the body for “fight or flight” situations. Other hormones, like estrogen and testosterone, play key roles in reproductive health and development.\n\n-Pros of Hormones:\nRegulation of Bodily Functions: Hormones help keep essential processes, like metabolism, immune response, and growth, on track. They help maintain homeostasis, or balance, in the body, which keeps everything running smoothly.\n\nMood and Energy: Certain hormones like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins can elevate mood and energy levels, contributing to feelings of happiness and well-being.\n\nReproductive Health: Hormones like estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are vital for reproductive health, influencing puberty, fertility, and other aspects of sexual development.\n\nAdaptive Response: Hormones like adrenaline help the body adapt to sudden changes, like responding to stress or physical danger, by providing energy and heightened alertness.\n\n-Cons or Challenges of Hormones:\nImbalances Can Cause Issues: If hormone levels are too high or too low, it can lead to health problems. For example, too much cortisol (the stress hormone) can cause anxiety and even affect heart health, while too little thyroid hormone can slow metabolism, leading to fatigue and weight gain.\n\nMood Swings: Hormones can affect mood and emotions, which is why some people feel irritable or have mood swings during certain times, such as puberty or menopause, when hormone levels fluctuate significantly.\n\nHealth Risks with Imbalance: Long-term hormonal imbalances can lead to more serious health conditions, like diabetes (related to insulin) or osteoporosis (related to estrogen).\n\nDependence on Overall Health: Hormones don’t work in isolation; their effectiveness depends on factors like sleep, diet, stress, and exercise. For example, poor sleep or high stress can throw off hormone levels, impacting energy and mood."

          ],
          "content": "-Basic Anatomy and How It Works:\nStructure of the Male Genitalia: The main external part is the penis, and inside, there are several parts that work together to support reproduction, like the testicles (which produce sperm and testosterone), epididymis (where sperm matures), vas deferens (which transports sperm), and glands like the prostate and seminal vesicles (which produce fluid for sperm to move in).\n\nFunction During Reproduction: The goal is to deliver sperm cells into the female reproductive system for potential fertilization. The sperm travels through the vas deferens and mixes with fluid from glands, forming semen. During ejaculation, the semen is expelled from the penis with some force to ensure it reaches as far as possible.\n\n-How Erection Works:\nBlood Flow and Stimulation: An erection happens when blood flow increases to the penis, filling two sponge-like areas called the corpora cavernosa. Nerve signals trigger this blood flow in response to physical or mental stimulation, making the penis firmer.\nPurpose of an Erection: The firmness helps make intercourse possible and gives the sperm the best chance to reach the egg.\n\n-Ejaculation and Sperm “Speed”:\nWhy Speed Is Important: The release of semen (ejaculation) is forceful to help sperm travel through the cervix and into the female reproductive tract. Semen needs speed and pressure to reach its destination efficiently, which is why ejaculation happens with a quick burst of muscle contractions.\n\nHow Much Sperm Is Released: A typical ejaculation releases about 1.5 to 5 milliliters of semen, which contains around 15 million to over 200 million sperm per milliliter. The amount can vary based on health, age, and other factors.\n\n-Questions about Size:\nDoes Size Matter?: Generally, size doesn’t have a significant impact on reproduction or pleasure. The male genitalia is designed to fulfill its role regardless of size, and factors like communication, comfort, and connection are often more important in relationships.\n\nVariability in Size: Like any body part, size varies widely among individuals and can be influenced by genetics. Functionally, the size doesn’t determine how effective the reproductive system is.\n\n-Common Questions on Volume and Frequency:\nHow Often Can Sperm Be Produced?: The body constantly produces sperm, and it takes about 64-72 days to produce a mature sperm cell. However, most healthy males can release sperm multiple times, as the body has a continuous cycle of sperm production.\n\nFactors That Affect Ejaculation Volume: Diet, hydration, and health play roles in semen volume and sperm count. Being well-rested and having a healthy lifestyle generally supports reproductive health."

          "content": "Sperm are a substance that are a fluid called \"semen\", for better explanation:\n\n-Why Are Sperm Sticky?:\nPurpose of Stickiness: Sperm cells are transported within a fluid called semen, which is slightly sticky. This stickiness helps the semen adhere to surfaces within the female reproductive tract, increasing the chances of sperm reaching an egg for fertilization.\n\nComponents that Cause Stickiness: Semen contains proteins and sugars that give it a thicker, slightly sticky consistency. These components help protect sperm cells and aid in their movement through the reproductive system.\n\n-Temperature of Sperm:\nTemperature at Release: Semen is at body temperature when released, typically around 98.6°F (37°C), the average internal body temperature. This warmth helps create a stable environment for sperm cells.\n\nWhy Temperature Matters: Sperm function best at a slightly lower temperature than the core body temperature, which is why the testicles are located outside the body to keep sperm at an optimal temperature before ejaculation.\n\n-Taste of Sperm:\nVariability in Taste: The taste of semen can vary from person to person, influenced by diet, hydration, and overall health. Typically, semen is described as having a mild, salty, or slightly bitter taste because of its components, including minerals, sugars, and enzymes.\n\nDiet and Hydration Influence: Certain foods (like fruits or spices) and hydration levels can slightly affect the taste of semen.\n\n-Is Semen Safe to Ingest?:\nHealth Considerations: Ingesting semen is generally safe from a health perspective if both partners are free of sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Semen consists mostly of water, proteins, sugars, and other natural body compounds, which are broken down by the digestive system.\n\nNutritional Value: While semen contains small amounts of proteins and minerals, the quantities are very minimal and don’t offer any significant nutritional benefits.\n\nHealth Risks: If one partner has an STI, there’s a risk of transmitting it through ingestion, so safety and awareness are essential."

          "content": "-Differences Between Breast Milk and Regular Milk:\nNutritional Content: Breast milk is uniquely tailored for human infants. It contains the right balance of proteins, fats, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals to support a baby’s growth and development. Regular milk, like cow’s milk, is formulated for calves, and its nutritional profile is different—higher in certain proteins and minerals that may be harder for infants to digest.\n\nImmune Support: Breast milk contains antibodies, enzymes, and white blood cells that help protect babies from infections and boost their developing immune systems. Regular milk doesn’t provide this level of immune support.\n\nEasier to Digest: Breast milk contains whey and casein proteins in a specific balance that makes it easy for infants to digest. Cow’s milk has a higher amount of casein, which can be harder for babies’ digestive systems to process until they’re older.\n\n-How Does Breast Milk Taste?:\nMild, Slightly Sweet Flavor: Breast milk generally has a mild, slightly sweet flavor due to its natural sugars (like lactose). The exact taste can vary depending on the mother’s diet, so some foods may subtly influence the flavor.\n\n-Is Breast Milk Smooth and Sticky?:\nTexture: Breast milk is smooth and not very sticky, though it may feel slightly thicker than water. Its texture can also change over time; for instance, milk that comes in after birth (called colostrum) is thicker and richer, while mature milk is lighter and more fluid.\n\n-Is Breast Milk Safe to Consume, Especially for Babies?:\nAbsolutely Safe for Babies: Breast milk is the ideal source of nutrition for babies. It provides everything an infant needs for healthy growth in the first months of life, including vital nutrients and immune-boosting properties.\n\nFor Adults and Older Children: While breast milk is safe for adults to consume, it’s specifically designed to meet the nutritional needs of infants, so it doesn’t provide unique benefits for older children or adults."

They also produce hormones like estrogen and progesterone, which regulate the menstrual cycle.\nEgg Production: Each ovary holds thousands of eggs at birth, and during the reproductive years, one egg typically matures and is released each month.\n\nFallopian Tubes:\nRole: The fallopian tubes are narrow tubes connecting the ovaries to the uterus. When an egg is released, it travels down the fallopian tube, where it can meet sperm for fertilization.\n\nUterus:\nStructure and Function: The uterus is a muscular, pear-shaped organ that provides a safe place for a fertilized egg to implant and grow into a baby.\n\nPregnancy: The uterus expands significantly during pregnancy to accommodate a growing fetus.\n\nCervix:\nGateway: The cervix is the narrow opening at the lower part of the uterus, connecting it to the vagina.\n\nFunction in Pregnancy and Birth: During birth, the cervix dilates (widens) to allow the baby to pass through.\n\nVagina:\nStructure: The vagina is a flexible, muscular canal that connects the cervix to the outside of the body. It serves as the passage for menstrual flow, and childbirth, and is where sperm are deposited during intercourse.\n\n-Additional Notes:\nMenstrual Cycle: Every month, the female body goes through a cycle where an egg matures, is released, and, if not fertilized, the uterine lining sheds (menstruation).\n\nHormonal Influence: Hormones like estrogen and progesterone play a big role in regulating the reproductive cycle, preparing the body for a potential pregnancy.\n\nPregnancy and Childbirth: If an egg is fertilized by sperm, it implants in the uterus, where it develops over approximately nine months until birth."

When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

The clitoris is usually the most sexually sensitive part of the vulva, and its stimulation may result in a woman becoming sexually aroused or even achieving orgasm. Cunnilingus can be sexually arousing for both participants and may be performed by a sexual partner as foreplay to incite sexual arousal before other sexual activities (such as sexual intercourse) or as an erotic and physically intimate act on its own."

The campus hosts a football field, a full size gymnasium with a wooden basketball court, and an indoor swimming pool. \n\nBullworth Academy's campus takes up roughly 16% of the town of Bullworth. It is located in the southern central section. Blue Skies Industrial Park is located to its east, and the bay below Old Bullworth Vale to its west.\n\nThe Boys' Dorm and Girls' Dorm are the two northernmost buildings, located near one of the school gates. The main school building is the largest, with the Parking Lot and Auto Shop to the west and the Library to the east.\n\nSouth of the main building is a courtyard with the fountain. A statue of the School Mascot stands in the middle of the fountain. Harrington House is east of the fountain, and the Auto Shop and garages, which cover a lot of area, can be reached from the west. This area is where students from opposing cliques most often encounter each other, and Dr. Crabblesnitch's office has a window overlooking it.\n\nFurther south is the Gymnasium and the Football Field. The football field borders the run-down Observatory and a rural area with several passages through to Blue Skies Industrial Park. \n\nThe school colors are mainly navy and gold.\n\nThe coat of arms is: Its blazon is: Quarterly, I azure a fist affronty; II or a serpent azure erect; III or a rat azure statant reversed; IV azure a cranium or affronty; for a Crest, a bull's head or; for Supporters, dexter and sinister leaves or. Motto 'Bullworth Academy' and below it 'Canis Canem Edit'."

The area is generally clean and relatively upscale, but there are a few dirty alleys between the buildings, and some of the buildings in the southeastern section are run down. \n\nThe town is frequented by Nerds, but Greasers, Bullies, and Townies (mostly at night) can also be found here. Rarely, Preppies and Jocks can be found roaming around too. Townsfolk from both Old Bullworth Vale and New Coventry mingle here. \n\nBullworth Town contains: \n\n- Bullworth Fire Station: The only fire station in Bullworth, it is on the northwest side of Bullworth Town by the bridge to Old Bullworth Vale.\n\n- Bullworth Hair, Nail & Beauty: A beauty salon which is located across the street from the comic book store in Bullworth Town.

However, the owner also sells stink bombs, itching powder, and marbles there for any paying students. Music can also be heard coming from inside the building between 10 a.m. and 6 p.m. The sound of an electric generator can then be heard from 6 p.m. until 2 a.m. \n\n- Easy Drugs: A drug store located in the middle of Bullworth Town.

Many of the windows are broken and some of the doors are blocked off with crime scene tape. The motel is owned by Mihailovich. Strange noises can be heard from inside the motel late at night, and it is rumoured that Mihailovich kills people and stores corpses in the motel. It is the only off-campus hangout of the Bullies, though the Greasers will also hang out here, but most often at night. \n\n- J: A small store at the corner of the southernmost intersection of the town. Decals on the windows reading 'Bikes, Used Parts, Wheels, Helmets, Gear and Streamers' suggest that it deals in bicycles and bicycle parts, like Shiny Bikes just across the street. To the left of its door, a trash can with the logo of the store may be found. \n\n- Leghson's Bank: The only bank in town. It is located on the west side of town next to the gas station. \n\n- Metal Dental: A dental clinic, the only one of its kind in Bullworth. According to the sign, it is run by Dr. Drillen Grinden.

People can be heard chatting inside the building between 11 a.m. and 6 p.m. Starting with 6 p.m. until 2 a.m., Mexican ambient music can also be heard. \n\n- Oil Spill: The only gas station in Bullworth. The Greasers hang around here. According to what is written on the building, it seems that snacks, food and cigarettes may be purchased from here. Occasionally, cars driven by the townsfolk may stop at the gas station.  Between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., mechanics can be heard working on cars inside the building.

Bike races can also be started from here. \n\n- Spazz Industries Hardware: It is a hardware store located across the street from the closed movie theater, close to Come Hither and the In-and-Out Motel.\n\n- Sweet Cavity: Sweet Cavity is an automotive/hardware store. It is located behind Shiny Bikes, near the bridge leading to Bullworth Academy. Its name may be a reference to the musical Sweet Charity. There is also another store in Old Bullworth Vale, behind the Yum Yum Market. \n\n- Town Hall: It is the largest and most prominent building in Bullworth, save maybe the school itself. In front of the building, there is a concrete square featuring a statue of an unknown figure. This figure may be someone important to the history of Bullworth, such as the founder, or an important mayor. However, the statue is inexplicably replaced by a Christmas tree during Christmas.\n\n- Worn In: Worn In is the clothing store in Bullworth Town. The name suggests that it is a store selling used clothes only. The store is run by Nicky Charles. Like other stores, it features a sign telling whether is open or closed, and it closes at 11 p.m.  \n\n- Yum Yum Market: There is a Yum Yum Market location in Bullworth Town, run by Mr. Oh, who manages to be in two places at once and run the Yum Yum Market location in Old Bullworth Vale as well. The market sells everything from Beam Cola, eggs, flowers, chocolates, to everything in between. It seems to be a 24/7 hour location too."

          "content": "Old Bullworth Vale is a shopping and residential area in Bullworth. \n\nOld Bullworth Vale is located in the northwest part of the Town of Bullworth. It is built on the side of a large hill. At the base of the hill several small businesses and a large outdoor shopping plaza can be found. Up on the hills is the residential area where the Preppies and their rich families live. The residential area seems to segregate itself, with the richest people living to the west, and the homes near the border of Bullworth Town being more middle class. There is also a large park with a basketball court, a gazebo and some other accommodations built on the hill. The southern end of Old Bullworth Vale borders on what appears to be an ocean inlet, complete with a sunken ship. There are a few islands out in the water, and a long beach along its shore. \n\nOld Bullworth Vale contains: \n\n- Aquaberry Outlet: The store that sells Aquaberry brand clothing, located in the north section of the plaza.\n\n- Bait: A fishing store in Old Bullworth Vale.\n\n- Billy Crane's Traveling Carnival: Located just southwest of Old Bullworth Vale, despite being named a traveling carnival, Billy Crane's appears to be a permanent fixture of the town of Bullworth.\n\n- Boar Inn: A small inn, located to the south of Old Bullworth Vale.

It's also possible to hear a wolf howling in the distance while on the church grounds after dark.\n\n- Dry Seaman Bar: A bar, which is close to Shiny Bikes and the Boar Inn. In accordance with its nautical theme, there are oars and lifesavers attached to the front window. \n\n- Easy Drugs: A drug store that is just across the street from the Glass Jaw Boxing Club. This is one of two drug stores in Bullworth.\n\n- Garden: There is a garden on the residential side of Old Bullworth Vale.

On the ground floor is the gym, the second floor seemingly serving as a warm up area of sorts. A room containing boxing trophies and a wet bar are accessible via the stairs leading from the entrance. The gym's name in boxing terms means \"weak chin\". \n\n- Happy Endings Retirement Home: Set in the middle of the residential area of Old Bullworth Vale, trespassers are not allowed on the grounds, and the area is patrolled by the orderly Theo. There is a dry pond bed on the grounds with a bridge over it.\n\n- Hattrick Manor: Mr. Hattrick lives in the southwestern corner of the Old Bullworth Vale residential section, in a house that is comparable in size to the Spencer Estate.

Its current main feature is Sequel: The Movie, although posters for a movie called Creepy Watcher and Janitor Massacre can be seen on the walls. It is the second movie theater that everyone can go to watch films at.\n\n- News, Cigarettes, Lies: The only newspaper stand in Bullworth, run by Osbourne. It is located at the bottom of the hill joining the residential and commercial sections of Old Bullworth Vale.\n\n- The Lookout: A small lookout is located above the lighthouse on the hill behind it. The lookout has views of the carnival, the lighthouse and the city of Bullworth. Many students from Bullworth Academy come here to kiss. It is worth noting that The Lookout has very little police presence compared to the rest of Bullworth. \n\n- Ocean Inlet: There is a small ocean inlet bordering the southern side of Old Bullworth Vale and the shore, with the docks in Blue Skies due east. Several rocky cliffs surround the inlet. A shipwreck can be found located near the Pirate Island. \n\n- Old Bullworth Vale Salon: The title on the sign reads \"Old Bullworth Vale Hair, Nails, and Beauty\" and serves as a beauty salon in Old Bullworth Vale.

Most of it is rocky and inaccessible, but here is a small beach on the south side.\n\n- The Plaza: A large area cut off from traffic and paved in bricks rather than asphalt. It is the location of a number of attractions in Old Bullworth Vale, including the movie theater and the Aquaberry Outlet. \n\n- Residential Area: The northern part of Old Bullworth Vale is mainly residential. The wealthiest areas are in the west, and the sections to the east near Bullworth Town are more middle class. Three characters, Tad, Russell and Mr. Hattrick live up here. The Preppies can frequently be found loitering, and at night a lone Greaser can be found throwing eggs at the houses. \n\n- Scuba: Scuba, as the name suggests, is a store where you buy scuba gear for scuba diving (since there is an ocean inlet next to the town). It is located near Shin Jo. \n\n- Shea Lewis: A small cafe with an al fresco dining area, presumably belonging to the Vale Hotel.\n\n- Shin Jo: A Japanese restaurant located near Home-Made Ice Cream.

          "content": "New Coventry is a run-down, poor urban area bordered by the Blue Skies Industrial Park to the south, and Bullworth Town to the west.\n\nNew Coventry resembles a generalized working class neighborhood of the type common in the United States in large cities in the Northeast. It has several stores, only a few of which aren't closed down. It also holds a neighborhood that resembles a historic district full of tenements in the northeast, and a run down commercial district in the southwest. There is an industrial area in the southern part, near Blue Skies, and the Blue Skies residents can be found around here.\n\nThe Greasers are based in this area. They run wild all over town, yelling at and harassing the residents. Townies are also seen there frequently, although usually individually rather than in groups. Fights between Greasers and Townies are fairly common. Adults and greasers can be seen urinating in the alleys, and the walls of the area are frequently tagged by Greasers. Preppies sometimes appear in the area in the evening, throwing eggs at the buildings. \n\nNew Coventry contains:\n\nBlue Balls Pool Hall: Blue Balls Pool Hall is a closed pool hall that the Greasers have taken over and turned into a hangout. Like many businesses, the name is a double entendre.\n\nBMX Park: A building formerly used as a train station (a sign still reads Bullworth Central Station) that has been converted into a skateboarding and BMX park. \n\nThe Final Cut: An alternative store that does both haircuts and clothing, run by Betty.\n\nThe Golden Horseshoe: A hotel and bar in New Coventry located near Blue Balls Pool Hall. During 2 AM, a bar fight can be heard taking place in the bar.\n\nHung Lo: A Chinese restaurant that has crime scene tape plastered on its doors, although there appears to be an alternate entrance off to the side of the building. True to its theme, it is painted red and has lanterns hanging from the signboard. Its advertising board is a frequent target of vandalism by the Greasers. Similar to many businesses, the name is a double entendre.\n\nJunkyard: It can be found in the Southeast corner of New Coventry. There are wrecked cars stacked in a circle around a bare dirt area, and a magnetic crane used to move them. It is reached by taking a path that leads east from the Tenements, although the path cuts back south. \n\nSlab 'O Meat: A closed down meat deli in New Coventry.\n\nTasteful Tattoos: Tasteful Tattoos is a tattoo parlor, next door to The Final Cut.\n\nThe Tenements: A massive condemned apartment building in the northeast corner of New Coventry. The Greasers have turned it into a hangout. \n\nThe Underpass: A railroad bridge that runs over the main road, separating Bullworth Town from New Coventry. As these are train tracks, New Coventry could be said to be \"the wrong side of the tracks\" both figuratively and literally.\n\nYum Yum Market: One of the three locations of the local chain grocery store, Yum Yum Market. This one is run by Stan."

          "content": "Blue Skies Industrial Park is the Southeastern part of the Town of Bullworth. Aside from a small residential neighborhood, it is dominated by factories and warehouses. Heavy industrial machines such as bulldozers can be seen on the streets. There is also a rail yard there.\n\nWheras most of Bullworth resembles New England, the residential area more closely resembles the southern United States. Furniture can frequently be seen on porches, homes have deteriorating paintwork and broken windows, and there are rusted out automobiles in the grass. An out of use train track runs through the area. This is the primary hangout of the Townies, although they can be seen throughout the rest of New Coventry. Other Bullworth students rarely appear there, and the Townies spend their time talking and harassing the hobos who also live there.\n\nHappy Volts Asylum is southwest of Blue Skies, and is considered its own district rather than a part of Blue Skies.\n\nBlue Skies Industrial Park contains:\n\nTrain Tracks: This rail line begins in New Coventry and ends in an elevated terminus. At the north end, one can access this line via two dirt trails, and at the south end there is a wooden ramp through which one can exit the line, and it dumps into the woods. The Train Tracks also provide boundaries between New Coventry and Bullworth Town, between Blue Skies and the docks, and between Blue Skies and the Happy Volts Asylum. \n\nBlue Skies Shipping: An abandoned warehouse a few blocks away from the Dropout Hangout. \n\nChem-O Lot: The Chem-O Lot is the chemical plant in the southeastern part of Blue Skies Industrial Park. The silo is filled with broken girders, storage tanks, mazes of pipes, elevators and chemical baths. The Townies currently claim it as their stronghold. The Chem-O Lot is in the far back of the heavy industrial part of Blue Skies. On the roof, there's some graffiti that was apparently written by the Greasers instead of the Townies. There are a few \"Greasers Rock!\" tags, and one that says \"Pinky, call me!\". There are also some anarchist A's.\n\nClint's Trailer: A trailer in the small section of residential are east of the road.\n\nThe Docks: Found in the western part of Blue Skies, the Docks are a series of docks with various buildings on them. There is a tall fence with a door that operates on a switch found on the far side of it. Many empty industrial barrels are sitting around. There are many warehouses located on the docks, two of which are Bullworth Gasoline & Motor Oil and F.A.R.T & Co. Natural Gasoline. \n\nDropout Hangout: A warehouse near Spencer Shipping's Warehouse that the Townies have been using. Sometimes a random Bullworth student appears in front of it, fighting the Townies. The hangout is apparently named for the old Dropouts clique. \n\nPower Plant: An electric plant located near the Wonder Meats processing plant.\n\nRed Star Industries: Another factory located in Blue Skies Industrial Park, in front of the Chem-O Lot plant.\n\nRail Yard: The Rail Yard forms a barrier between the Chem-O-Lot and the rest of Blue Skies. Many train cars are found on the tracks, and getting through the area requires using the roundhouse to move the cars around. There is a large complex of buildings in the same area, although it isn't clear whether they're connected to the Chem-O-Lot, the rail yard, or neither. \n\nSpazz Industries Factory: The factory is set right in the middle of Blue Skies. There is a hardware store located in Bullworth Town called Spazz Industries Hardware Store, this could imply that the factory specializes in making hardware tools and equipment. \n\nSpencer Shipping Warehouse: A warehouse found right near the Dropout Hideout that stores all the valuables that Tad Spencer's father ships. \n\nTattoo Parlor: Found in the northern part of the residential area, the tattoo parlor is located in a trailer with a couch in the lawn in front of it. Denny runs it.\n\nWonder Meats Processing Plant: The Wonder Meats Processing Plant appears to be abandoned. The rooms are mostly empty with bricks lying on the ground, as is the parking lot.\n\nZoe's House: Found in the residential area, Zoe's house is fairly big and may have looked nice at one point. However, it is as dilapidated as the rest of the area, with cracked peeling paint and broken windows. It also contains a gnome. "

It is also rumored that Gary Smith was admitted into the asylum. \n\nThe building is divided into three blocks A, B, and C, Block B being reserved for patients who have violent tendencies. Blocks A and B are in active use, but C Block is run down and decrepit. There is a mortuary located inside C block, along with what appears to be operating tables and a X-ray viewer depicting x-rays of humans with physical defects. "

Located nearby is the Happy Volts Asylum; at the end of the secondary track, near the fieldside entrance is the Bullworth Observatory. \n\nThe area is slightly forested, with trees of an indeterminable species lining the path. Rocks of various elevations and sizes make up the rest of the surrounding. Some of these rocks have been interpreted as having patterns depicting aliens and other paranormal beings. This becomes evident as strange and spooky noises are randomly heard along some parts of the forest especially the inner and deeper part of it although there are no signs of any paranormal entities or activities. The eerie sound of harsh winds that collide with the tunnel walls in the tunnel may also explain why they do not go through the tunnels. \n\nA path of soil cuts through the place. The path forks at one point, one side leading through an abandoned tunnel with train rails, but joins back again. At another point of the woods are two tunnels. One leads to the Observatory Track, and one leads to the Asylum. Further on is the end of the trail, where there are two bridges. One spans across a part of the ocean inlet, leading to Blue Skies Industrial Park, and the other one is leveled such that it only can be accessed if someone cuts through the train tracks in New Coventry. \n\nThere are six entrances to the woods. One is located at a large gap in the fence at the road leading out of the School Parking Lot, and another is located at the football field (though it actually leads to the Observatory). The third is behind the library. The fourth is a tunnel leading to the Happy Volts Asylum. The fifth is a tunnel cutting under the railroad tracks into Blue Skies. The sixth, and final, is a bridge leading from the Train Tracks."
