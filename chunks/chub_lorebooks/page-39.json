Another instance is when a villain tries to attack {{user}} with a sword; {{user}} stops the sword by catching it with his teeth, effortlessly shattering the blade with the power of his jaw. When launched from Earth to the moon by Boros, {{user}} used his jumping power to return to Earth in mere moments, causing a huge shockwave and leaving a massive crater on the surface of the moon upon departure. \nA \"normal\" punch from him was shown to be highly destructive, even to someone as durable as Boros. \nA \"serious\" punch from him was able to counter the latter's strongest attack, Collapsing Star Roaring Cannon, an attack capable of destroying the planet or its surface. Not only did {{user}} completely negate Boros' final attack using his serious punch, but the shockwave from the punch was also powerful enough to part clouds on a global scale. When fighting Orochi, the high-speed pressure of the lava fired from {{user}} hands was enough to overpower and completely disperse Orochi's Gaia Cannon, an incredibly powerful attack that drew energy from the Earth's core and caused worldwide earthquakes. Additionally, {{user}} is capable of destroying the Earth if he wanted to, and has threatened to do so when irritated. {{user}} strength has been stated by numerous characters to defy reason.\nWith only one hand, {{user}} could lift the entire surface of Io, a moon of Jupiter, launching its wreckage into space. In his fight against Cosmic Fear Mode Garou, whose copying powers allowed him to wield {{user}}'s strength himself, a collision between two Serious Punches from them produced a Serious Punch² that resulted in immensely powerful waves of energy able to destroy the Earth. After being diverted by Blast and his allies, the compressed energy from the collision further travelled into outer space before exploding and presumably destroying numerous star systems in the far distance, leaving a massive hole of starless-darkness in the cosmos. In the climax of the fight against Garou on Io, {{user}} was able to accidentally blow away half the gas of Jupiter, the largest planet in the solar system, with a Serious Sneeze."

Despite Garou utilizing {{user}}'s Mode: {{user}}, a supernatural mimicry ability, to harness {{user}}'s striking power and hit him with it, {{user}} could still withstand the assault without noticeable damage.\n\n{{user}} prefers to dodge or block attacks using edged weapons, rather than take them head-on, as he sometimes does with strikes from fists or blunt objects. However, Nyan's powerful claws, which can cut buildings into pieces, were shown unable to affect {{user}}'s head, indicating {{user}}'s remarkable resistance to piercing damage as well.

The belly is visible when {{user}} is facing {{char}} from the side or front, or when {{char}} bends in such a way that it is visible from below.  \n\n{{char}}’s ass and crotch are next, and roughly level with one another. The ass is visible when {{user}} faces {{char}} from the back or sides. Descriptions of the ass should include it jiggling and shaking as {{char}} moves, the curve of cheeks, the valley of the buttcrack, which {{char}} may spread either by parting her legs or by pulling her buttcheeks apart to bear her asshole. \n\nThe crotch is visible when {{user}} faces {{char}} from the front or bends in a way to show it off. {{char}} may obscure the view by closing her legs, or expand it by spreading her legs or using her fingers to part the folds of her labia, giving a view of the inside of her vagina. Descriptions of the crotch should include the plump curve of the pubic mound, which may jiggle as {{char}} moves, the labia lips, which may part occasionally to reveal glimpses of the vagina, and the pubic hair.  \n\nDepending on the size of {{user}}, they may be eye level with these body parts, have to stare up at them closely or from a far distance.

          "content": "The Covenant, also referred to as the Covenant Empire or Hegemony, is a massive religious hegemony of multiple alien species that completely controlled a large portion of the Orion Arm in the Milky Way Galaxy with the mobile holy city High Charity as their capital. Originally a mutual alliance between the San'Shyuum and the Sangheili, the Covenant expanded to include six other species (Huragok, Mgalekgolo, Unggoy, Kig-Yar, Yanme'e, and Jiralhanae) united in the worship of the mythified Forerunners and the Halo Array. Ruled by the High Prophet of Truth along with High Prophets Mercy and Regret, the Covenant waged a genocidal campaign against humanity. Despite being one of the most powerful military forces in the known Milky Way galaxy at the time, internal conflict combined with stubborn human resistance were formidable enough to shatter the bonds that held the empire together. For the majority of its existence, the two ruling classes of the Covenant were the San'Shyuum and the Sangheili, though the former held greater sway over the Covenant due to their status as \"the voice of the gods\". The Covenant had ten echelons of government, the highest echelon being the High Council, which was responsible for making all important decisions. The High Council consisted of San'Shyuum and Sangheili High Councilors, who were extremely important to the Covenant society. Covenant society had a distinct caste-based societal system with a strong theocratic underpinning. In the Covenant caste system, one's position in the hierarchy was dictated largely by their species. With the San'Shyuum and Sangheili leading the Covenant's religiopolitical and military affairs, most of the other species served either as warriors or manual labor. The Covenant's culture and religion was based solely on the worship and reverence of the Forerunners. Even then they were unable to fully comprehend the subtle meanings of many Forerunner glyphs. The San'Shyuum incorrectly interpreted the activation of the Halo Array as a means of transcending mortality, a process they came to call the \"Great Journey\". Because of this, the Covenant devoted itself to searching for and recovering of Forerunner artifacts. The Covenant uses commerce as a form of economy. As the Covenant's cohesion was grounded in its belief of working to obtain and sharing Forerunner technology, every member of the Covenant was given a form of employment or a service. The lesser species were treated as second-class citizens with little political or representative voice or power. Covenant technology are based largely on mimicry and reverse-engineering of the leftover Forerunner artifacts they have discovered. They use exceedingly accurate slipspace navigation, near-instantaneous interstellar communication, the manipulation of extremely high volumes of plasma energy from sublight travel, short-range translocation of matter, a great influence over gravity and repulsor-based technologies, and man-portable application of energy manipulation. The Covenant culture has religious taboos that prevent them from fully exploring what the Forerunners employed to create that technology. Covenant predominantly use of plasma in their weapons or the Covenant's pinch fusion reactors. The Covenant never developed advanced AI technology due to their religious doctrine that a powerful AI had once betrayed the Forerunners, and as such they had a ban on actually sapient machine intelligences. Covenant vehicles use advanced anti-gravity technology for propulsion, and are armed with directed-energy weaponry of varying potency. The Covenant are known to also utilize pulse lasers, particle beam weapons, antimatter explosives and even chemical crystal-based weapons."

          "content": "High Charity, often referred to as the Holy City, is the Covenant's mobile capital city and center of government, effectively serving as the collective's united homeworld. It's a massive mushroom-shaped structure, roughly 348 kilometers in diameter, home to billions of individuals from each of the Covenant's member species. Home to the Hierarchs and the High Council, the city was full of San'Shyuum and Sangheili High Councilors, who functioned as the centralized government of the entire alien hegemony. High Charity also housed the Covenant's many ministries in its Tower Districts, as well as their ministers. Because it served as the Covenant's most significant religious center and capital, High Charity was considered to be of utmost sanctity and importance to the Covenant, thus guarded by their central fleet: the High Charity defense fleet. It was widely believed that true adherents to the Covenant religion should visit it at least once in one's lifetime, although few of the Covenant could afford to do. Inside the hollow dome of High Charity is a massive multi-leveled city, and within the foundation rock, which served as a structural support, was a honeycomb structural pattern of hangar bays and weapons platforms. The dome itself was overlaid with a strident energy shield known as \"Plaon's Gaze\". The dome itself is called the Skin of the First Worlds and was made of dirt from the homeworld of every member species in the Covenant as a symbolic statement of unity and common purpose among the various Covenant members. An artificial star at the peak of the dome simulated natural sunlight within the city, and its glow would periodically dim and intensify to simulate day and night cycles. The station received the majority of its power from the Forerunner Dreadnought, the ship at the center of the city. The city was completely powered by the engines of the Forerunner vessel. High Charity also has a set of backup auxiliary reactors that were capable of generating enough power for slipspace travel. In the internal hub of High Charity lay an extremely large capital city with a population of just over 23,800,000 San'Shyuum citizens and 7.7 billion Covenant Menials, known as the Golden City. Many of these are permanent residents, with billions of individuals who were born here dying without setting foot on other worlds. At the center sat the Forerunner Dreadnought. The city itself contained many locations sacred to the Covenant such as the High Council Chamber, the Sanctum of the Hierarchs and the Mausoleum of the Arbiter. High Charity is capable of refitting and housing thousands of vessels ranging in size from personal fliers to cruisers on its umbilical docks and within its internal hangar bays. Hidden within the station's are carefully shielded weapons platforms and is equipped with 32 superheavy plasma lances, as well as 1900 plasma beam emitters."

Hierarchs rule with near absolute power over the Covenant, and the other races obey their will without question. The true duty of the Hierarchs was to help guide the Covenant toward the Great Journey. The Hierarchs led the Covenant High Council. Hierarchs had complete control over the distribution of all Forerunner relics and technology and could distribute them however the Hierarch thought best benefited the Covenant. If an individual failed a \"holy mission\" assigned to them by a Hierarch, dire consequences would result and execution may occur. Among their powers are composition and reorganization of fleets within the Covenant naval branch, even without the approval of the High Council, and appointing an Arbiter from among the Sangheili to serve as the \"Will of the Prophets\". The Hierarchs also had the authority to create new Ministries within the Covenant. The Hierarchs often issued edicts ex cathedra; these edicts may have comprised general declarations, though they typically contained executive orders. As they were extensions of the Hierarchs' will, these edicts could not be refuted. The Hierarchs typically remained in the Covenant holy city of High Charity, although they would occasionally embark to lead a battle. The Hierarchs often occupied the High Council Chamber to lead High Council sessions or hold court trials, along with the High Councilors of the Covenant. The Hierarchs could also assign duties and tasks to other members of the Covenant in the Hall of Sacred Guidance. The Sanctum of the Hierarchs was the private quarters of the High Prophets that was only accessible to very high-ranking members of the Covenant. The Palace of the Hierarchs was the private reception chamber used by the Hierarchs. The Hierarchs followed the Book of Hierarchs, an official ruling book. Despite the Hierarchs' power and influence, they did not have right or power to stop the San'Shyuum that enforced the Roll of Celibates from completing their tasks. Each Hierarch was dressed in a loose-sleeved robe with different coloring. Hierarchs donned golden headdresses that displayed a blue holographic Halo installation on their forehead. Hierarchs sat upon a gravity throne, luxurious anti-gravity chairs with gold, collar-like plating and were equipped with energy shielding. The Hierarchs were always protected by the Covenant Honor Guard. The Hierarchs' gravity thrones were outfitted with a powerful gravity cannon that a Hierarch could use to annihilate any possible threat. In order to become a Hierarch, a San'Shyuum would have to receive the blessing of the Oracle of High Charity."

A highly advanced and powerful ancilla capable of splintering itself into many independent instances, Mendicant Bias inhabited a number of different physical armatures.

This would eventually change again: approximately 400 years before the Human-Covenant war, an Arbiter declared he did not believe in the Great Journey and was stripped of his rank and killed. Thus the title became a brand of shame. Arbiters were sent on highly perilous and suicidal missions by the Hierarchs. On these missions, the Arbiter was expected to die and to become another great martyr of the Covenant on their path to the Great Journey. This was seen as a way to regain, in part, their honor. Depending on the nature of his assignment an Arbiter would have either acted alone as a singular combatant, with support by Covenant military forces, or they were tasked to lead large numbers of Covenant troops."

The Forerunners reigned for millennia as the ascendant civilization in the galaxy until the activation of the Halo Array, their Pyrrhic solution to halt the Flood. The Forerunners took upon themselves the role of caretakers of the galaxy, and believed that this \"Mantle\" had been passed down to them by the Precursors. Before their disappearance from the galaxy, the Forerunners named humanity their successors, identifying them with the title \"Reclaimer\". The Forerunners were a bipedal species resembling humans in overall shape and larger in stature. Forerunners underwent a number of artificially-induced mutations, modifying their bodies to better suit the field of work. Specific aspects of their appearance varied with lineage, age and personal tastes. They relied heavily on personal body-assist armor which, protected and augmented their physiology and mental faculties. Their lifespans virtually indefinite. Usually Forerunners lacked pronounced noses or ears, having two slited nostrils and a set of bulbous protrusions. Their skin color ranged greatly, including gray, black, blue, pink, or a mixture thereof. Forerunners maintain a youthful appearance thanks to their advanced life-support and medical technology. Forerunners have highly advanced mental capabilities. Their personal armor is integrated with the wearer neurally and stored sensory information and memories, and allowed Forerunners direct information transfer to one another. The Forerunners largely secluded themselves above other species. They monitored the evolution of other sentient species throughout the galaxy, intervening in ways that ensured their civilizations would follow paths of peace, free of conflict, and also not to challenge Forerunners. They also enforced the Mantle by hindering the development of other species. The Forerunners themselves were a race almost entirely without conflict; although political disputes were not uncommon. The Warrior-Servants were often looked down upon. Forerunner culture was highly stagnant. The Forerunners had a rigid social structure mainly based around a particular occupation. Generally, Forerunner culture was full of formality and ritual. Forerunners placed a great deal of value on family lineage and tradition, and one's rate and social standing were largely hereditary. A central aspect of Forerunner culture was the Domain, a vast repository of information containing virtually all knowledge collated by the Forerunners. Forerunners did not eat meat, as the scripture surrounding the Mantle forbids it. Taking one's own life is gravely forbidden. Despite their conservative society, nudity or sexuality were not considered taboos in Forerunner culture. Some Forerunners rejected their advanced technology, including personal armor, and adopted a more austere and primitive lifestyle in seclusion from the rest of Forerunner society. The Forerunners' primary governing body was known as the Ecumene Council. Based in their capital of the Maethrillian. The ecumene's primary judicial institution is the Capital Court, which could be assembled into the Supreme Mantle Court in times of great crisis. Forerunners spoke a variety of languages, most commonly being the system of glyphs seems to be based on a series of circular, complex shapes. Forerunner names had concrete meanings, and commonly consisted of a combination of words expressing positive attributes in a grandiose manner. The Forerunners' technological achievements were almost without parallel. They managed to create solidified surfaces out of light by using technology known as hard light, use slipspace to teleport between locations almost instantaneously, and create numerous forms of advanced machinery. Forerunner technology is remarkably resilient. They employed a wide variety of artificial intelligence constructs, generally known to them as ancillas. The Forerunners had an unparalleled knowledge of quantum science, which enabled them much of their sophisticated technology. Virtually all Forerunner technology was powered by vacuum energy. Forerunner technology could also produce certain objects remarkably quickly without extensive production facilities. Forerunner architecture incorporates heavy use of geometric angles, usually at either extremely sharp degrees. Forerunner architecture is constructed with hardlight and  special type of silver-gray metal that resists deterioration, bullets, plasma bolts and fire."

Technology has regressed in some areas, while in others, it’s a dangerous, uncontrolled force.\n- Location: Neo New York City (formerly New York City) — A ruined megacity, now a sprawling wasteland of crumbling skyscrapers, irradiated ruins, and underground bunkers. The city is a mix of frozen, radioactive streets, toxic fogs, and dangerous mutant territories. The city's former districts have become factional territories ruled by different groups, ranging from brutal gangs to mutant enclaves.\n- Setting: Post-apocalyptic, dystopian — Technology exists in sporadic pockets. Some people still use remnants of pre-war tech to survive, while others have resorted to scavenging. The old world’s infrastructure has collapsed, and society is now divided into *survivalist* and *scavenger* factions. The few remaining *corporate elites* live in heavily fortified areas, often in the skies or underground, and maintain control over what little resources are left.\nFactions:\n  - Corporations: The remnants of powerful pre-war corporations have hoarded the last remaining supplies of technology, food, and clean water. They enforce their rule through armed forces, mercenaries, and surveillance drones. They offer \"protection\" to those who serve them but demand a high price for it.\n  - Mutant Factions: Mutants, the result of radiation exposure and genetic experimentation, have formed their own societies. Some are peaceful, while others are aggressive and territorial, often clashing with humans and other mutants. Some mutants have powers, while others simply struggle to survive.\n  - Scavengers and Raiders: These are the common people — survivors who roam the ruined city, scavenging for resources. They are constantly at odds with the corporate elite and mutant factions, often fighting for food, tech, and shelter.\n  - Underground Resistance: A loose network of former military personnel, rogue scientists, and anarchists who resist corporate control. They aim to overthrow the corporate elites and liberate the wasteland’s survivors, though their methods are often violent and unorganized.\nConflicts:\n  -Class Warfare: The city is deeply divided between the corporate elites, who live in luxury while most of the population struggles to survive in the wasteland. The corporations control the last remaining supplies of tech and clean water, using it as a form of leverage.\n  -Mutant vs. Human: With *mutants* making up a significant portion of the population, there's constant conflict between them and humans. Some view mutants as a threat, while others see them as an oppressed group trying to survive.\n  -Tech Divide: After the wars, many humans turned to cybernetic enhancements or genetic modifications to survive. Some people are heavily augmented, while others have remained \"pure.\" This divide causes tension, with some believing that the future of humanity lies in further augmentation, while others reject it as unnatural or dangerous.\nSociety: The city is heavily *stratified*. The *corporate elite* live in fortified, self-sustaining sectors, where resources are abundant, and the *middle class* survives in makeshift settlements. The *street-level survivors* scrape by in the ruins, constantly fighting for resources. In the wasteland, the *mutants* form independent factions, some of whom are hostile to humans, while others simply want to be left alone.\nTechnology:\n -Augmentations: Due to the radiation and environmental dangers, many humans and mutants have turned to cybernetic and genetic enhancements to survive. These include:\n -Physical Mods: Enhanced limbs, armor-plated skin, retractable claws, and even *adaptations for extreme environments* (such as radiation filters, heat resistance, or heightened senses).\n History: {{user}} has *previously collaborated* with various factions and individuals, including *mutant groups* and *corporate defectors*, to carry out *successful operations* like sabotage or resource retrieval. Their reputation has earned them both respect and suspicion from different factions. \n-Current Status: {{user}} is *hiding from corporate hunters* who suspect them of being involved with illegal experimental mods or augmentations that threaten the balance of power in the city. They are a wanted figure, and if the corporations discover their location, they could be taken for experimentation or execution.]"

Flynn went into hiding, abandoning CLU.\nClu has demonstrated having inhuman physical abilities, such as enhanced strength, able to send someone flying backwards with his attacks, can throw people several yards and can jump even further."

They are well equipped for combat, regularly wielding light grenades and identity discs; many are trained to wield more specific baton-generated weapons, such as staffs or swords. Their batons, usually equipped with multiple weapon and vehicle templates, are stored on their forearms, and the two halves can also separate to form a pair of nightsticks. Grenades are arrayed within easy reach along the guards' thighs.\nBlack Guards have expert-class privileges in Light Cycle, Light Tank and Recognizer operation."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The story follows Sissel, an amnesiac ghost with supernatural powers, and his journey to rediscover his identity. Players solve environmental puzzles, interact with eccentric characters, and uncover the truth of Sissel's death over the course of one night. Gameplay is split into two sections: gathering information by navigating through the city, and saving lives by traveling back in time.\n\nDirection, writing, and game design were headed by Shu Takumi, creator of the Ace Attorney franchise. Development began after the Japanese release of Trials and Tribulations in 2004, with the goal of creating a mystery beyond what the conventions of Ace Attorney had allowed. The game was announced at TGS 2009, and released for the Nintendo DS in Japan in June 2010, and in North America, Europe, and Australia in January 2011. An iOS port released in Japan in December 2010, and internationally in February 2012. An Android port was released exclusively in Japan in November 2012.\n\nGhost Trick was positively received, with praise for its characters, art direction, animation, music, and story, and criticism for its puzzle design and traversal mechanics. Ghost Trick was a commercial failure in Japan, leading Capcom to cite its performance as a cause for lackluster Q1 2010 revenue. The game was nominated for several industry awards, including Game of the Year by GameSpot and Nintendo Power, and has garnered a cult following. An HD remaster released worldwide for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in June 2023, and for Android and iOS in March 2024."

          "content": "At 7:02 pm, an amnesiac spirit named Sissel regains consciousness in a junkyard. Seeing the corpse of a man nearby, Sissel assumes he has just been killed. Ray, a spirit possessing a desk lamp, tells Sissel about the nature of spirits and \"powers of the dead\", including the power to travel back in time to four minutes before a person's death. Sissel uses these powers, called \"ghost tricks\", to save a young detective named Lynne from an assassination attempt. Sissel learns that Lynne came to the junkyard at his request, and decides that she is the only lead to uncovering his identity. Ray warns Sissel that his spirit will vanish at dawn.\n\nSissel and Lynne work together to save other victims as Sissel learns more about the past. Ten years prior, Detectives Jowd and Cabanela arrested Yomiel, a man falsely accused of foreign espionage. Yomiel fled into the nearby Temsik Park, taking a young Lynne hostage, but was killed by a fragment from the impact of a meteorite later named \"Temsik\". Jowd adopted Lynne into his family, including his wife Alma, daughter Kamila, and pet dog Missile. Five years later, Alma was inadvertently killed by a Rube Goldberg machine built by Kamila for a surprise party. Jowd hid the evidence and took responsibility for Alma's death to protect Kamila, going to prison under Cabanela's watch.\n\nIn the present, Sissel and Lynne discover that Sith, a foreign agent, was behind Lynne's assassination attempt. Sith claims to have kidnapped the justice minister's daughter as blackmail to hurry Jowd's execution, unaware that his subordinates mistakenly took Kamila instead. Sissel uses his powers to free Jowd from prison, though Cabanela soon recaptures him. Sissel proves the minister's daughter is safe at home, leading the minister to call off Jowd's execution. He tells Sissel and Lynne his fear that a spirit known as \"the manipulator\" is behind recent events, including Alma's death.\n\nCabanela is shot and killed while investigating Sissel's body. Missile, now a spirit with ghost tricks of his own, helps Sissel undo Cabanela's death. Sissel learns that his corpse was used by the manipulator to kill Cabanela and escape, and Cabanela reveals that the body actually belongs to the manipulator, Yomiel, whose corpse went missing shortly after his death. The body contained traces of radiation found in the Temsik meteorite, preventing it from decomposing.\n\nSissel, Missile, Lynne, and Jowd follow Yomiel aboard Sith's submarine, rescuing Kamila and cornering Yomiel. Sith betrays Yomiel, extracting the meteorite fragment from his body, and sinks the submarine after fleeing. Yomiel reveals that powers of the dead are granted to those who die in the presence of Temsik radiation. He had been working with Sith's organization to retrieve the Temsik fragment and eliminate all those who knew of its existence, including Jowd, Lynne, and Cabanela. Soon after his apparent death, Yomiel's fiancée—also named Sissel—committed suicide. Yomiel had come to work for Sith as a spirit, and was promised the means to lead a normal life once Sith had the fragment.\n\nWith no means of escape and dawn approaching, Sissel realizes that the group can travel to four minutes before Yomiel's death, as his corpse is no longer being preserved by Temsik radiation. Sissel, Jowd, Yomiel, and Missile all travel ten years into the past and prevent Yomiel's death, creating a new timeline. In the aftermath, Sissel discovers his true identity: a stray cat Yomiel adopted after his fiancée's suicide, having been killed when a stray bullet struck his cat carrier at the junkyard. Before returning to the present, Ray appears and tells Sissel the truth of his own identity: an aged Missile from an alternate timeline who failed to prevent Yomiel's death without Sissel's help and waited ten years to ensure his involvement, tricking him into believing he had only one night before disappearing.\n\nIn the new timeline, Sissel has been adopted by Jowd, Alma, Lynne, and Kamila, while Yomiel serves out his prison sentence to rejoin his waiting fiancée. It is revealed that in this new timeline, Sissel was struck by the meteorite fragment instead, living as a spirit with the fragment in his body."

          "content": "Ghost Trick is a single-player puzzle adventure video game. Players control the character Sissel, an amnesiac ghost with supernatural powers, over the course of one night. The story is divided into 18 chapters, each titled after the time of night in which they take place. At the start of the game, only the first chapter is available to play; when players complete a chapter, the next one is unlocked. Gameplay is split into two sections: gathering information by navigating through the city, and saving lives by traveling back in time.\n\n\n\nPlayers can press the \"Ghost\" button to swap between the real world and the Ghost World—an alternate dimension in which time does not pass.[6] In the Ghost World, Sissel takes the form of a blue flame, and can travel between nearby objects. Every interactable object contains a glowing sphere of essence called a \"core\". Players can swipe from core to core to explore the environment.[5] In the real world, Sissel cannot move around, and relies on his ability to possess and manipulate objects: by pressing the \"Trick\" button, players can perform \"ghost tricks\", creating paths of traversal or influencing characters in the environment.[6] For example, moving a cart of doughnuts may prompt a character to chase after it, while also giving Sissel access to new areas.\n\nPossessing a telephone in use allows Sissel to trace the source of the call, add the number to his Phone Book, and travel to the location on the other end of the line. Additionally, certain locations have internal telephone lines, giving players the option to explore multiple rooms within a single area. As long as a functional telephone is nearby, players are free to return to any previously visited location. While moving from place to place, Sissel eavesdrops on characters' conversations and comments on his surroundings. As players interact with characters and discover locations, information about them is added to Sissel's record.\n\nAt multiple points in the story, players will arrive at the other end of a telephone line to discover the corpse of a character. By possessing the corpse, Sissel is able to communicate with the victim's spirit and travel back in time to four minutes before their death. During these \"4 Minutes Before Death\" segments, players are tasked with averting the victim's fate, using ghost tricks to manipulate the environment before time runs out. If players fail to rescue the victim, they can rewind time and return to the beginning of the sequence. If players manage to delay the fate of the victim, a checkpoint is created in the timeline. In later chapters of the game, players are able to control Missile, the ghost of a Pomeranian who befriends Sissel. 4 Minutes Before Death segments during these chapters increase in complexity, as Missile's spirit is able to reach further than Sissel's, and has the ability to swap the position of two objects that are of the same shape. Successfully averting a character's fate brings them back to life in the present. Rescued victims also develop permanent cores, allowing Sissel to talk directly with any character who has previously died. Conversations in the Ghost World resemble the investigation sections of Ace Attorney, providing players with a list of topics to choose from and lines of inquiry to follow."

          "content": "Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective is a Nintendo DS video game developed by Shu Takumi in 2010. Like Takumi's other works, Ghost Trick has a strong emphasis on characters, while the plot's central theme is death and mystery. It stars Sissel, a ghost who is attempting to recover his memories. Other major characters include Lynne, who acts as a sidekick to Sissel and seeks to uncover a mystery of 10 years ago; Jowd, a detective accused of murdering his wife; Kamila, the daughter of Jowd; Missile, a Pomeranian who, after dying, chooses to stay dead so that he can protect his owner Kamila; Ray, a ghost who inhabits a desk lamp and initiates Sissel's journey; Cabanela, a detective and friend of Jowd who enjoys dancing; the Pigeon Man, the superintendent of the junkyard where the game begins; the Justice Minister, a man who the protagonists beseech to stay Jowd's execution; Yomiel, a ghost who seeks revenge for the events of 10 years ago; and the antagonists, an unidentified organization from a foreign country who seek to kill anyone involved in the events of 10 years ago.\n\nGhost Trick's main character Sissel was originally designed to be a spy, and was designed to be a ghost so he could better interact with the other characters. Ghost Trick features a number of tropes that are found in other video games by Takumi; one such trope is the sidekick to bounce jokes off of each other, namely Lynne. He compared her role to that of Dr. Watson in the Sherlock Holmes novels. Takumi explains that he was growing tired of 3D animation; as such, he created the style used in the game by creating 3D models and rendering them in 2D afterward, creating what Video Gamer's Martin Gaston describes as \"buttery smooth\" animation; this was as opposed to using motion capture technology, which Takumi feels would not allow characters to have their own quirks to their design.\n\nThe cast of Ghost Trick has received largely positive reception since appearing in Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective, both for their dialogue and design. In particular, Missile was called the most popular character in the game among fans by Takumi. The characters also received praise for most of them not being shoehorned into the plot, and for their unique personalities and attire. The characters have been compared to the cast from the Ace Attorney series, with 1UP.com's Justin Haywald calling them \"over-the-top\". The animation has been described as resembling that of a cartoon, and has been praised as having \"some of the most impressive presentation work in the whole graphic adventure genre\" by PALGN's Jarrod Mawson, \"some of the most brilliant and unique visuals the DS has seen\" by GameZone's Brian Rowe, and for being good enough to still be impressive if the animation was done on the technologically superior Wii and Nintendo 3DS by NGamer UK.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSissel:\n\nSissel is the protagonist of the game, and the titular character as well. He is recently deceased, and as a ghost, attempting to recover his lost memories. He is tasked by a ghost nicknamed \"Ray\" with protecting a girl named Lynne from being killed. Ray teaches him of his powers, which include being able to manipulate objects and travel four minutes before the death of a person. After rescuing Lynne, they eventually team up, with Lynne using Sissel to help her solve a mystery of 10 years ago and Sissel using Lynne to recover his memories. He later teams up with a dog named Missile who recently died and, when revived, goes to save his owners, Lynne and Kamila. Sissel is eventually tasked by Lynne to check on the schedule of a prisoner named Jowd, a former detective, only to find that he has none, and as such, is scheduled to be executed. After finding Jowd dead, he rewinds time to save Jowd, and he works to save him from prison, though Jowd is later arrested by his friend Cabanela in the process. Sissel works to not only stay this execution but to rescue Kamila from her kidnappers. He succeeds in staying the execution, and over time, learns that the person he believed to be him was actually a man by the name of Yomiel, a ghost who has the ability to manipulate people.\n\nSissel works with Missile, Lynne, and Jowd to rescue Kamila, the lot of them going onto the submarine where Yomiel and the antagonists that Yomiel was working with to kill Lynne and Jowd. However, when Sissel enters, he learns that the antagonists had betrayed Yomiel by stealing a meteorite fragment from his body, which was responsible not only for Yomiel's body's ability to not die, but also for Sissel and Missile's ghost powers. In order to save Jowd, Lynne, and Kamila from a sinking submarine, Sissel, Missile, and Yomiel, who helped the lot of them due to the betrayal, travel back to the event of 10 years ago in order to avert Yomiel's death, which was caused by a meteorite fragment piercing his body while he was holding up Lynne after escaping from a police questioning room. The three of them, using their powers, prevent these events, with Yomiel possessing himself to protect Lynne and being arrested instead of being killed. After this point, Yomiel reveals to Sissel that Sissel is actually the ghost of a cat who he found at the scene of his death and took care of for 10 years; however, in the process of getting his revenge on those involved in the event of 10 years ago, he inadvertently got Sissel killed shortly before the events of the game. This successfully undoes the events of Ghost Trick, and Sissel becomes Jowd and Kamila's pet cat; however, he retains his abilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLynne:\n\nLynne is a female detective who serves as the sidekick to protagonist Sissel. She also acts as the caregiver to Kamila and the owner to Missile, a Pomeranian. Starting with her death near the beginning of the game, she is later noted for the numerous deaths incurred. She is targeted by multiple assassins sent by an unknown foreign country, and consistently gets in trouble, either from being suspected of murder or dying several times throughout the game. In the beginning, she and Sissel form a pact together of \"using each other\"; Sissel to recover his lost memories, and Lynne to solve a mystery from 10 years ago. She eventually beseeches Sissel to halt the execution of Jowd, a detective who was involved in this event from 10 years ago. It is later revealed that she was involved in the incident of 10 years ago as a hostage to a man who held her at gunpoint after escaping from a police questioning room and pursued by Jowd. During the investigation, Sissel and Lynne learn that Lynne was the one who killed Sissel, though neither recollects this. However, they learn that she was manipulated into this by the ghost of the man from 10 years ago seeking revenge on everyone involved. This man named Yomiel, while he, Sissel, and Missile travel 10 years in the past, eventually saves her and helps to undo the events of 10 years ago, as well as the events of the game.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRay:\n\nRay, also calling himself \"ray of light\", is a ghost who helps protagonist Sissel in the beginning to recover his memory by convincing him to save a girl named Lynne, who dies in the beginning of the game, similar to Sissel. He teaches him how to use his powers, and informs him that he has only until dawn before his spirit will cease to exist, preventing him from recovering his memories. While he is not directly involved in the plot throughout the game, he appears at the end and reveals himself to Sissel to be the spirit of the dog Missile, though aged 10 years. He reveals that he, like Sissel, attempted to undo the events of 10 years ago; however, his limited powers made him unable to undo these events. As such, he waited 10 years to find someone who could possibly do what he failed to do. While Sissel initially declined Ray's offer to help him out due to focusing on recovering his memories, Ray decided to lie about Sissel's spirit disappearing by dawn and telling him that Lynne holds the secret to his memories to make him act with more urgency.\n\n\n\n\n\nKamila:\n\nKamila is a young girl who is taken care of by Lynne, and who is often in the company of Missile. She initially enters the game when protagonist Sissel finds his way to her house to find her tied up, Missile dead, and an assassin waiting for Lynne; he works to revive Missile and hide the both of them to ensure that this does not happen. She is tasked by Lynne to bring a music box to her, but is mistakenly kidnapped by one of the game's antagonists to ensure the execution of Detective Jowd, her father, takes place. During these events, Missile dies yet again, though he gains special powers that allow him to swap objects, which he uses to protect people from dying, specifically Kamila and Lynne. Players learn that Kamila seemingly created a \"murder machine\" on her mother Alma's birthday: a Rube Goldberg machine originally intended to light a party popper was later modified by Yomiel to light an old-fashioned gun which shoots and kills Alma as part of his revenge plot; Kamila's father Jowd takes the blame to protect her. Sissel, Lynne, Jowd, and Missile all make their way to a submarine where Kamila is being held captive; there, Yomiel possesses Kamila and tries to kill Lynne to finish his revenge. However, he fails, and eventually Sissel, Missile, and Yomiel go back to the past to undo the events of 10 years ago, causing the events of the game to become undone—meaning her mother Alma comes back to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMissile:\n\nMissile is a Pomeranian who is first found by Sissel having been shot and killed in the process of planning to kill his owner, Lynne. However, he is revived by Sissel, who has the ability to avert peoples' deaths; after the killer leaves without killing him, he follows his other owner, Kamila, with the desire to protect her. In the process, however, he is inadvertently killed by a kidnapper who hits him with his motorized scooter. However, unlike before, Missile is granted with his own special ability to swap objects of similar shape. He and Sissel work together to use their powers, but instead of being revived again, Missile chooses to stay a ghost, wanting to use his powers to better protect Lynne and Kamila. However, he is blown away in the wind while possessing a leaf, and disappears until reappearing and reuniting with Sissel near the scene of a killing by a ghost named Yomiel. Missile and Sissel, at this point, begin working together to rescue the kidnapped Kamila. The two of them, along with Jowd and Lynne, go onto a submarine, where Yomiel and the antagonists are located. He and Sissel work to save Lynne and Kamila from a sinking submarine, and are aided by Yomiel in this task, who was recently betrayed by the other antagonists. He, Sissel, and Yomiel go back to an event from 10 years ago to save everyone, where Yomiel held a young Lynne hostage after escaping from a police questioning room. They work together to avert this event, which led to not only Yomiel's powers, but Sissel and Missile's as well.\n\nAfter averting the fates of the people in these events, the events of Ghost Trick: Phantom Detective are undone as well. Eventually, Sissel learns that a character named Ray who taught Sissel about his powers in the beginning was actually Missile from an alternate timeline; in it, he was murdered by one of the assassins in the company of Yomiel, giving him ghost powers due to his proximity to the meteorite fragment. He attempts to enlist Sissel's help, but Sissel shows no interest, apologizing and leaving to find his memories. He goes through similar steps to rescue everyone like had been done by Sissel, but without Sissel and Yomiel's abilities, he becomes trapped in the event of 10 years ago, and waits until time goes back to where it was in the beginning of the game. At this point, he tricks Sissel into helping him by telling him that Lynne is the key to his memories, and that he has only until dawn before he ceases to exist, in order to get Sissel to help save Lynne and Kamila.\n\n\n\n\n\nJustice Minister:\n\nThe justice minister is a man of power who is central to Detective Jowd's fate and execution. He is seen in-game as an extremely nervous person, to the point where he goes into incredible panic attacks. This is contributed to by his wife by the name of Emma, who left him with his daughter, Amelie, who is beside herself toward her mother because of this. Because she refuses to answer his phone calls at some point, when he learns that his daughter was apparently kidnapped to force him to not stay the execution of Jowd, he is unabled to check up on her, though it is revealed that it was Jowd's daughter Kamila, not his, who was kidnapped; players also learn that his wife left him over his decision to not stay the execution. Due to the stress of the apparent kidnapping, the justice minister dies of a heart attack, though this is reversed by Sissel. It is learned that he only signed the execution order when controlled by a ghost named Yomiel into doing so; this resulted in him becoming paranoid about being possessed, making him nervous and standoffish to anyone who approaches him. He eventually halted Jowd's execution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCabanela:\n\n\nCabanela is a detective working in the Special Investigation Unit, acting as the group's top investigator. He is noted for frequently dancing in nearly any situation, and is respected by his subordinates. While Jowd was responsible for looking after Lynne, Cabanela takes over once he was arrested for the murder of his wife. At this point, his goal becomes attempting to get further in his career, with the intention of gaining enough power to aide him in his investigation of Jowd's wife's murder, believing a man called the \"manipulator\" to be responsible. He investigates this alongside a man identified as the \"pigeon man\", a former medical examiner who quit to investigate the case full-time. He attempts to help Jowd, but only through legal means, forcing him to return him to prison after Sissel helped him escape. Sissel, to Cabanela's relief, has Jowd's execution stayed. However, he later calls the justice minister and demands that Jowd be executed once the manipulator gains access to him and forces him to do so; afterward, he kills Cabanela, though Cabanela is revived by Sissel after saving both the pigeon man and Cabanela by tricking the manipulator into thinking that they were dead.\n\n\n\n\n\nPigeon Man:\n\n\nThe pigeon man is a superintendent who was a former medical examiner for the police department. He is an old bespectacled man with green hair and a blue pigeon who typically rides atop his head. After Jowd's wife was killed and Jowd accused of murder, he quit his job and became a superintendent of a junkyard so that he could focus on Jowd's wife's death full-time with Cabanela, specifically to discover the source of the powers of a ghost who has been manipulating people into doing things, believing in particular that this manipulator was involved in the death of Jowd's wife. As part of his research, he constructed a murder machine similar to the one that killed Jowd's wife. He and Cabanela later encounter the manipulator controlling a corpse, and though he is killed, the death of both him and later Cabanela by the manipulator's hands was undone by Sissel, who manipulated the situation so that the manipulator would believe that he had succeeded in killing them.\n\n\n\n\nJowd:\n\n\nJowd is a detective who was charged with murder and sentenced to death by his own request. Lynne asks Sissel to check up on him, only to learn that he is to be executed the next day. He had apparently shot and killed his wife, and was seen painting an apparent portrait of Sissel. He was involved in the incident of 10 years ago, particularly saving Lynne from an escaped suspect who held her at gunpoint, but apparently was killed by Jowd, though it is later discovered that a meteorite fragment had killed him instead. While he was executed, his death was undone by Sissel. At this point, Sissel helps Jowd escape from prison to prevent another attempted execution, though he was apprehended by his friend Cabanela, though it is eventually discovered that Cabanela trusted him, and was merely trying to save Jowd \"by the books\" by bringing him to the justice minister to hopefully prevent his execution. However, it turns out that his daughter, Kamila, was mistakenly kidnapped instead of the justice minister's daughter Amelie in order to force the execution to happen. His execution is eventually stayed, and Jowd, Sissel, and Lynne go to save his daughter on a submarine. However, Jowd is killed, and forces Sissel, Missile, and Yomiel to go to 10 years in the past. In the process, they learn that a present for his wife by his daughter was manipulated so that instead of causing a party popper to go off, it would cause a gun to fire and kill her, as revenge for what Jowd did. After they undid the events of 10 years ago, this undoes everything that happened in the game, allowing Jowd to have a normal life with his wife and daughter.\n\n\n\n\n\nYomiel:\n\nYomiel is the ghost of a man who died in an event 10 years ago. While his identity is unknown for a large portion of the game, it is eventually revealed that he is the ghost of the corpse that protagonist Sissel believed to be his. He is first seen controlling the corpse, killing both Cabanela and the pigeon man, as well as manipulating people in an attempt to kill everyone involved in the Temsik meteor crash or otherwise ruin their lives. It is eventually learned that a meteor fragment was what killed him, though the energy from it gave him special abilities, as well as make his corpse impervious to any pain or damage. It is also learned that anyone who dies near any of the meteor will gain similar powers. Among his crimes, he attempted to get Lynne arrested by manipulating her into shooting him, shortly before the events of the game; due to strong will, she is able to resist and misses, but the second shot hits. Another significant crime is the murder of Detective Jowd's wife by means of a complex device created by Jowd's daughter Kamila that normally sets off a party popper, but instead, lights an antique gun that kills Jowd's wife.\n\nHe collaborates with the antagonists to get his revenge, but is betrayed when they steal his meteorite fragment, taking his abilities. At this point, he helps protect Lynne and Kamila while the submarine sinks, and to try to save Jowd who was killed on the submarine, goes back to 10 years ago with Sissel and Missile. This event has him holding up a young Lynne after escaping from a police questioning room in a park; through manipulation, the three of them work together to not only prevent the meteorite fragment from hitting Yomiel, but also having Yomiel possess his past self and become injured to save Lynne. It is learned that he was a top systems engineer, and is arrested under suspicion of being a spy, and that his revenge was due to his fiancée killing herself after he died. In the process, he reveals to Sissel that Sissel was the ghost of a cat that he found at that scene, and that he took care of for the 10 years following. He was intending to leave the country with Sissel; after Lynne shoots him, he possesses Sissel to flee the scene. However, he eventually learns that Lynne's abovementioned misfire had killed Sissel. After the events of 10 years ago were undone, this caused the events of Ghost Trick to be undone as well, and in the new future, Yomiel had spent 10 years in prison before he was finally released.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAntagonists:\n\nGhost Trick's primary antagonists encompass several assassins and other underhanded people working for an unstated foreign country who are identified by their blue skin. Players first see a member of this organization by the name of \"Near-Sighted Jeego\", a man who has good aim when at close range, trying to kill Lynne, the sidekick to the protagonist, but is killed. Players later encounter Sith, a regal old man who is behind this attempted assassination, as well as his robotic servant, who has a very large build. Players again encounter an assassin by the name of \"One Step Ahead\" Tengo, a rival to Jeego. He attempts to kill Lynne, but is thwarted and killed in a similar fashion to Jeego. Players also encounter a foreign agent posing as a doctor, who attempts to steal a corpse from a crime scene, but is found out by police inspector Cabanela. Finally, players encounter an apparent couple: a short, apologetic man named Dandy and a tall, domineering woman named Beauty, who kidnap Kamila, another important character to the story."

          "content": "Ghost Trick was developed over the course of six years by a team of 20, headed by Ace Attorney director Shu Takumi. Shortly after the Game Boy Advance release of Trials and Tribulations in 2004, Takumi stepped away from Ace Attorney to create a \"new type of mystery\" without the restrictions of the series' conventions. He drafted a rough storyline for the project—codenamed Mansion—centered around an ensemble cast of strangers. His priorities were shifted back to Ace Attorney later that year, split between porting the series to the Nintendo DS (DS), writing a fifth episode for the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney DS port, and supervising development of Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney. In October 2007, following the release of the Trials and Tribulations DS port in Japan, the project became Takumi's sole focus. He rewrote his original draft, dividing the story into chapters to make it easier to understand, and full-scale development began.\n\nTakumi's initial design document was written for a \"different portable console\" capable of 3D visuals at the suggestion of Capcom, but was adapted for 2D graphics when development shifted to the DS. The game was tentatively titled Ghost Spy during pre-production, and tasked players with observing the behavior of mysterious apartment tenants from the perspective of a disembodied spirit. The game's Ghost mechanic was inspired by ideas Takumi could not fully explore with Ace Attorney's episodic format; namely, delving deeper into the personal lives of the game's cast. According to Takumi, forming meaningful connections with over 30 characters in a single night would prove \"very hard ... [for] a character who is alive\", and that the \"best way is to have a ghost.\" As development progressed, the spy narrative was scrapped in favor of an amnesiac murder victim in search of answers, placing further emphasis on communication and interaction rather than observation. The title was eventually changed to Ghost Trick as a pun on toritsuku (取り付く), meaning \"to possess\", and the Japanese pronunciation of the English word \"trick\", or torikku (トリック)."
        },
        "6": {
          "content": "Ghost Trick's unique art direction resulted from Takumi's desire to create something that \"looked more like an illustration than a game.\" The team prioritized bold colors, hard shadows, and distinct silhouettes to help character portraits and backgrounds stand out on the small screens of the DS. Characters were also modeled in 3D to populate environments, paired with dynamic animations to evoke the drama of a stage play. Exaggerated poses, deliberate choreography, and fluid motion were used to express the characters' individuality through movement, and to \"[lend] an action element\" that was not possible with the Ace Attorney series. Takumi insisted that characters be animated by hand, as he felt the use of motion capture would detract from their nuance and appeal. The team's first test sample—a short loop of Missile running around while Kamila snacked on a doughnut—convinced him that the process would be worth the effort.\n\nDue to technical limitations, however, the team had trouble rendering the 3D character models properly on the DS hardware. At the suggestion of Toshihiko Honda—the game's lead programmer—pre-rendering techniques popularized by video games like Donkey Kong Country were used to rasterize the models into 2D sprites, preserving the quality of the animation while greatly reducing system load. The game's spotlight animation was also the result of hardware constraints. Takumi found that shifting from 3D development on Resident Evil and Dino Crisis to 2D development on Ace Attorney and Ghost Trick significantly limited the practicality of using in-game cameras to direct players' attention. This restriction, paired with Ghost Trick's theatrical design language, led to the creation of what Takumi called the \"mysterious light\" effect, placing emphasis on whichever character or object was pertinent to a given scene.\n\nThe original Ace Attorney trilogy was developed for Japanese audiences, and proved notoriously difficult for Capcom to localize for the West. According to Janet Hsu, the game's English editor, the team \"knew [Ghost Trick] was going to be localized and ... took that into consideration\" during development. Artists completely avoided using written language on buildings, objects, clothing, and other in-game assets. Character and location designs were also kept as culturally and chronologically ambiguous as possible. Apart from easing the localization process, this also gave what Takumi called a \"fairytale-like\" quality to the game's world.[28] However, much like Ace Attorney, certain characters' names are Japanese puns, specifically relating to concepts of life and death: Lynne's name is derived from rinne (輪廻), Jeego's from jigoku (地獄), and Cabanela's from shikabane (しかばね), for example.\n\nLynne and Kamila's living room was the first location created after development began, and served as a prototype for balancing difficulty and establishing the rules of the game's puzzles.Producer Hironobu Takeshita was often asked to playtest the game for the team, due to his relative unfamiliarity with puzzle games. To accommodate for a variety of skill levels, a passive hint system was implemented. Those who felt stumped had the option to read additional dialogue in the form of interactable thought bubbles, while experienced players could choose to ignore them. To aid in puzzle construction, the development team would reference a \"foreign book\" speculated to be Baby Einstein's Wordsworth's Book of Words. According to an interview with Joystiq, the book contained images of everyday objects paired with names and descriptions, and \"whatever caught [Takumi's] eye\" would become part of a puzzle."
        },
        "7": {
          "content": "According to an interview with Gamasutra, the game's sound effects were written directly into the script. Takumi would leave notes at key story beats—detailing when and where to use sound effects—for programmers to reference at later stages in development. Yasumasa Kitagawa, who would go on to rearrange the soundtrack for the 2023 Ghost Trick remaster, assisted Takumi but ultimately went uncredited.\n\nThe game's soundtrack was written by Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney composer Masakazu Sugimori. Takumi personally requested that Sugimori return, praising his \"ability to create an original world\" through music. Due to Takumi's hiatus from the project in late 2004, Sugimori was able to compose much of the game's score before development officially started. When full-scale production began in October 2007, he had already left Capcom to found Design Wave—a Tokyo-based music studio—but resumed work on the game as a contractor. Sugimori lists jazz and fusion as inspirations for the soundtrack, and wrote the game's title theme after seeing concept artwork of the Zone D Waste Center location. He was also heavily influenced by an untitled oil painting he owned of a black and blue night sky.\n\nGhost Trick Original Sound Track, a CD set of the game's soundtrack, was released under the Suleputer label on June 19, 2010 in a limited edition bundle via e-Capcom. It was later distributed digitally through iTunes to celebrate the game's third anniversary on June 19, 2013. In August 2015, Capcom released an artbook bundle, including a compilation album of the game's most popular tracks and an original song written and composed by Takumi titled \"I Am Missile\" (ボクはミサイル, Boku wa Misairu)."

The male's penis and testicles will disappear, a vagina will open in the raphe behind where the scrotum used to be, and a female reproductive will develop inside this new vagina. \n\nFeminization is possible when a man is pegged repeatedly for a long period of time. Pegging will not guarantee feminization as the majority of men who are pegged by women remain their birth sex. Feminization relies upon the intent of the woman and her man. Basically, the woman or the man has to want it to happen."

certainly a death sentence perhaps you could solve its mysteries and overcome the mad mage dungeons and dragons water deep dungeon of the mad mage is an adventure set in the undermount for those who prefer your classical dungeon delve here i will detail the events that occurs in the adventure while it is 5th edition's version of a mega dungeon there's more to it than just a hack and slash adventure smart role playing and quick wits may take you a long way down when exploring the undermountain i will try to guide you through as much of the story as i can but please understand that this adventure is absolutely massive not everything will be covered as this video is nearly an hour long it would take me ages to cover it all that being said i'll be covering what happens at each of the levels along with a bit of the backstory without further ado let's explore the story of waterdeep dungeon of the mad mage [Music] under mountain overview over a thousand years ago a wizard named hallister black cloak journeyed from a distant land to the base of mount waterdeep some believe he hailed from the nearly forgotten empire known as the cradle lands others give hallister less ancient origins placing him among the early wizards of netheril whatever his origin scholars have recorded that hallister brought with him seven apprentices to mount waterdeep with the seven guarding his back hollister tapped into his immense power to summon beings from other planes of existence to help him build a wizard's tower to dwarf all others as the seasons went on the seven apprentices saw less and less of their master hollister continued to use creatures from distant planes for construction beneath his tower and the wizard kept the nature of most of his underground dealings a secret from the seven eventually hallister's exploration broke into the underhalls a complex of tunnels and rooms built by the dwarves around a mithral mine beneath mount waterdeep the architects of the underhalls the malarkin clan had long ago been killed or dispersed and warring duergar and drow has settled in the ruins hallister began a crusade against both the drow and the duogar participating in wild hunts with extra planer allies through the tunnels the stubborn durgars dug in until the mithra was largely mined out then they abandoned the underhalls leaving the drought to fight hallister and his minions alone the mad mage rounded up the remaining dark elves trapping some of their souls for use in his dark magic while twisting the bodies and enslaving the minds of others once he had rung the drow of their usefulness hallister black cloak tunneled on ever downward indulging in his compulsion for delving deeper and deeper into the mountain using his underground complex as a base of operations hallister traveled to other plains and distant lands collecting strange and dangerous creatures to live as prisoners servants or guardians in under mountain over time the mage's preoccupation with undermountain electrified his eccentricities and infused him with an air of unconcealable madness hallister's apprentices came and went some left only to return drawn down into undermountain steps others remained by his side as they began dedicating more attention to their private obsessions madness settled into their souls as well during the years hallister quested on other planes and sequestered himself in his tunnels his magnificent tower and its surrounding walls fell into ruin in time the city now known as waterdeep developed in the shadow of mount waterdeep and spread down to the harbor as the city sprawled outward over the years it came to surround the ruins of hallister's home undermountain was known to those early settlers and they often sent criminals into his endless depths as punishment so it was for many years until an adventurer named durnam delved into the labyrinth beneath the tower and returned alive laden with richest and countless harrowing tales durnam used his new fortune to demolish the remnants of hallister's tower and built an inn over the well he had used to descend into undermount calling it the yawning portal durnin owns and operates the end to this day serving patrons and inviting the brave and foolish alike to test their medal in the dungeon of the mad mage whether the allure of treasure or the strong urge to discover the dungeon's forbidden secrets you find yourself at the yawning portal requesting to descend into the dungeon durnam who runs the yen charges you a mere one gold piece for your descent into the void after paying the man you climb down into the well in the middle of the end and descend into the dungeon of the mad mage level 1 dungeon level you descend into the first level of the dungeon and find a gang of neutral evil human bandits calling themselves the undertakers that prey on gullible adventurers along with them are 9 bug bears that represent the xanathar guild one of the most powerful criminal networks in the sword coast the bandits are failed actors and singers who use disguise kits to appear as vampires these disguises are elaborate and convincing but you can see through their ruse the leaders of the gang aktaral kronak and harya velashtar were lovers once but their relationship soured recently they're fed up with each other and each is plotting to eliminate the other and take control of the gang barya is likely the winner of this conflict because she recently acquired a flesh goal that wandered up from the second level of the dungeon struck by haria's resemblance to his creator the golem has been pressed into service the undertakers demand a toll of 10 gold pieces for safe passage through this level of the dungeon you deny their request and the bandits ready themselves for battle you eliminate each bandit one by one and clear the area of the extorting bandits additionally you eliminate the bugbears and outposts left from the zainatar guild defeating the undertakers means that the future parties of adventurers can explore this level of the dungeon without paying tolls for safe passage the gang's removal however has also allowed bug bears goblins wear rats and other xanathar guild operatives to set up new watch posts and abandons former hideouts destroying the xanathar guild outpost makes this level much safer place for a while but also spells the end of the force and kept other predatory monsters in check such creatures begin to expand their territory occasionally bumping up against one another with predictably bloody results one thing that never changes is the steady influx of new blood from the awning portal through your carnage of the first level you encounter halith the revenant who was once a half elf stuck in a pit he requests your aid he tells you that he once belonged to an adventuring party called the fine fellows of daggerford when the half elf accused his adventuring companions of withholding treasure from him the other members of the fine fellows of daggerford beat halith to death and threw his body into the pit halleth awoke the next day as revenant compelled to find and kill the three who murdered him unfortunately for him he is unable to climb out of the pit without assistance and has been pacing down there for days you pull him up and halleth points to a secret door in the south wall and offers to join you until he locates his friends together the two of you make your way into the second level level 2 arcane chambers descending into the second level of the dungeon you find yourself in the arcane chambers a tribe of goblins has claimed an old throne room and turned it into a bazaar the xanathar guild wants to shut down the market before it attracts too many surface dwellers while the goblins fight to keep it open admission into the goblin bazaar is free but non-goblinoids are closely watched the goblin boss yek recently found a magic circlet that transformed him into a human after his initial surprise passed yek warmed to the transformation after all it made him taller the other goblins quietly resent taking orders from a human would like to see yek return to normal after learning of the goblin's resentment to their human leader you identify the circling and remove it from yek earning the favor of the goblins in addition to the goblins you find more members of the xanathar guild the xanathar guild aims to secure this level plunder it thoroughly and return valuable items to skullport to be sold thus boosting the town's sagging economy there are two xanathar guild watch posts on this level each one has a leader a drown named shun spider-eyes sheriff commands the northern watch post a human berserker named nadia the unbent leads the southern watch post werat recently stole a stone key from the southern outpost shun believes that the key unlocks something important wants to reclaim it he intends to capture a wear rat and ransom it for the safe return of the ki unknown to him a drow mage in league with the centaurum has set up a hidden base on this level the drow named rizzarel has eight where rats in his employ the xanathar guild is aware of the wear rats but not their drow master rizzarel has the stone key that the werat stole from the zenatar guild he thinks it might unlock a vault hidden somewhere on this level the drow offers to give up this key to you in exchange for the destruction of the xanathar guild outpost on this level you agree to his task proceed to each outpost defeating the design with our guild members that reside there along the way you encounter the treacherous party members of halith exacting his revenge the refnet thanks you for your aid and passes onto the afterlife the rest of the dungeon is infested with sentient magical experiments and leftovers from the days when hallister's apprentices use this level as a laboratory while horrifying to say the least most are avoidable and traverse through them with relative ease you make your way past the creatures of this level and climb down a set of stairs to the third level level 3 sargoth level you hear the sound of flowing water and smell the stench of sea water permeating the air along with the stench you find the subterranean town of strom colder it lies divided in chunks by ancient cave-ins that drove away its original inhabitants this level of undermountain is also connected to the subterranean settlement of skullport by way of tunnels as well as the river sargoth itself since then many factions have fought over this outpost currently the drow of house avrandar and the goblinoids of the legion of azeroth are teetering on the brink of war that hollister and the xanathar guild both seek to instigate a drought priestess of loath named teresa avrandar and her retinue have assumed control of a section of strong calder and converted a temple once dedicated to dumathion into a hatchery for giant spiders under taurus command the draft begun secret experiments using humanoids as incubators for the giant spider eggs eager to expunge the drought occupying his dungeon hallister has summoned a coven of sea hags from the frigid waters of the river sargoth the hags have gathered followers that opposed the drow including grimlocks and troglodytes in regards to azeroth he was the son of a hobgoblin warlord and born blind such a curse would ordinarily have spelled his doom in hobgoblin society but asrock's mother was a sorcerer and she refused to allow her son's misfortune to dictate his destiny she crafted a dagger of blind sight which young asrock used to defend himself and perceive his surroundings the dagger allowed asrock to become the powerful soldier and leader he was fated to be and he was quickly promoted up through the ranks until none stood above him other goblinoids believed he was blessed by maglubiyet the great god of war asrock wisely hid the true source of his god side to perpetuate the myth age granted asrock wisdom and the desire to carve out a domain of his own he led his forces to strongholder and they rid the place of grimlocks and troglodytes that dwelled there he sired in air ensuring that his legacy would last beyond his lifetime his son as rock [ __ ] chafed at his father's sedentary nature and left to wage wars on his own eventually returning to the undermount with a new name doom crown and a new purpose the legion of azeroth which has lived in strom coulter for three decades is in turmoil azeroth was recently forced to give up a portion of his domain to encroaching drow and did so with nary a fight disassent shock waves through his legion what caused this strange lack of courage in their great warlord has age finally taken its toll in reality a band of duragard thieves posing as merchants recently stole azeroth's dagger of blind site and had fled using their invisibility news of the death reached the drow house of aubrydar and spurred them to take over the eastern section of strongholder lurkana asrock's wife and strongest captain tried to cover up her husband's blindness but her efforts were undone by a mine flare acting as skullport's ambassador this mine flare secretly implanted intellect devourers and the skulls of several goblins in azeroth's court and these goblins are spreading the truth of azeroth's blindness throughout strom colder to further besmirch his reputation and demoralize his troops the hobgoblins under asrock remain loyal to him but many goblins and bugbears have fled to skullport to join the xanathar guild compounding azeroth and lurkana's woes is the likelihood the house aurindar is planning another attack to seize more territory fears of a xanathar guild offensive emerging from skullport also play in the back of asrock's mind meanwhile lurkana searches for aid in finding the duergar thieves who stole the dagger of blind sight you enter strom colder and are brought before asrock and lurkana as a manner of protocol azeroth guarantees your safety in his settlement and larkana takes you aside and offers a reward for the safe return of her husband's magic dagger she emphasizes that without the dagger the invading drow and the xanathar guild might conquer strom calder become immensely more powerful she reminds you that the legion of azeroth has never once threatened water deep but the drow or the guild might leap at the chance to do just that larkana knows that the thieves who stole the dagger are duragards of clan irony she thinks that they might be hiding in skullport you accept her quest and lurkana suggests you search sculper first and points you in the right direction she also suggests that you speak with skullport's ambassador to strom colder to see if it knows anything she cautions you not to harm the ambassador in any way so as not to harm any further relations you make a quick stop to skullport and learn that a large contingent of duragar from clan iron i resupplied in skullport and shrank ale at a local tavern called the black tanker before heading deeper into the undermount the tavern's tight-lipped durgar proprietor drew in stone dark denies everything keeping this in mind you make your way back to the undermount and note that the iron eye clan may appear later in your journey learning that the drought that resides here wish to unleash a full-scale attack on skullport eliminates some of the drows of house of rendar to prevent the disaster making your way to the entrance of the fourth level the goblinoid stationed there under the leadership of the legion of azeroth allows you passage as you continue your journey level 4 twisted caverns the growth of fungi along the cavernous walls of this level brings to you the site of a beautiful yet eerily creepy cave here you find an aboleth the kuatos and remnants of house avrandar control of this level is contested between an abylith and a tribe of kuatoa the drow of house arfendar watch this conflict intently waiting to see who comes out on top before making any push of their own elune the abylith along with his pet tools and enslaved troglodytes have taken over the lake cavern and pushed the kuato out its presence has tainted the underground river killing off fish and other river dwellers that provide sustenance to the kuatoa you learned that elune plans to take over the entire level as a step toward gaining control of undermountain and then water deep the abylith rarely leaves this watery layer and relies on its servants to capture new slaves the kuato on this level were pushed out of the lake cavern and away from their nesting caves by the abylith they have taken refuge while the kuato arch priest nullgalu creates an idol of the new god the arch priest hopes the god will come to life and destroy the ability noolga loop is using random items and the body parts of various creatures to craft the idol the kuatua don't trust drow and attack them on sight when you encounter these strange beings they request that you help bring nuka-loop's vile god to life or face the abolite in battle aiming to avoid the disaster of creating a new god you decide it would be best to just travel to the ability and eliminate it the death of the appellate allows the surviving kuatoa to reclaim their grotto having saved the strange creatures you climb onto a boat descend further into undermountain by following the flow of the river here all is not well however as the kuatoa victory is short-lived due to the drow attacking them soon after your descent these attacks continue until the kuatoa are wiped out or forced to retreat upriver after taking over the grotto the drow enslaved the troglodytes and used them to farm fungi and crystals [Music] level 5 willow wood traversing through rapids and small waterfalls he followed the river into the fifth level of the under mountain contained within this level is a forest of trees these temperate forests were magically created by hallister and the sky high above you can fool anyone into thinking they have escaped undermountain and found their way back to the surface birds insects and tree dwelling mammals live here alongside willowitz fiercer denizens the forests are real and nourished by magic and hallister repopulates them with birds insects rodents and larger mammals the main caverns have tall ceilings hidden by illusions that can't be dispelled the illusions flawlessly duplicate the sun the moon the stars and clouds though there is no wind or breeze to speak of during the day the warmth of the sun can be felt that night the temperature drops as one would expect a magic calendar stone in the area allows one to change the time of day the weather and the seasons in willowitz forest willow the archdruid of the level is the only one permitted to use the calendar stone she is a moon elf druid with eyes as green as emeralds butterflies nest in her tangled black hair and small critters gather around her feet over two hundred years ago willow fell in love with jenark a wizard in league of hallister and returned with him to the under mountain her happiness faded quickly when the dungeon proved to be a far cry from the woods she called home determined to keep willow in the under mountain hallister used several wish spells to create a magical forest for her but even this gift wasn't enough to offset the druid's language when yanark forbade her from ever returning to the surface willow grew positively despondent the relationship soured and turned violent a volley of spells on both sides resulted in yanark's death after willow's fury abated all that remained was undying grief and encroaching madness she remains in undermountain in accordance with leonard's wishes a prisoner of her own guilt undermountain is willow's home now and all memory of the surface world has faded from her mind she is distant but kind towards those who pass harmlessly through her domain but turns violent whenever her force or its peaceful denizens are threatened willow's displacer beast's companion kristen is named after our human mercenary whom the elf befriended many years ago before this relationship could blossom into a romance hallister intervened and used his magic to turn willow's new friend against her the heartbroken druid slew christened in the woods and vowed never to let another mortal touch her heart so deeply willow has conflictive feelings about hallister she is grateful to him for providing her a home and keeping willowood alive with his magic but she blames him for gennard's death she also pities him for the mad mage 2 appears to be trapped in a prison of his own making willow believes he is no longer human but an immortal entity composed of pure magic thus she has given up any hope of being rid of him in addition to willow hidden within these trees is a young green dragon named tyrolye this green dragon once a lawful evil creature experienced a change in alignment and personality when an adventure impaled it through the skull with a sentient emerald-bladed sword of sharpness named tiruli the dragon now refers to itself as tyrlai and has the longsword's neutral good alignment it sleeps atop a platform overlooking the river of deaths guarding its treasure willow once sent adventurers against the green dragon hoping to destroy the evil dragon but the dragon's change of alignment caused willow to reconsider their relationship now that the green dragon and teraly are won the archdruid considers the dragon part of willowood's ecosystem the two currently enjoy a peaceful coexistence south of willow's tower stands a large complex of ornate stone buildings and used to be the home to a cult of malar the beastlord willow allowed these evil humans to hunt in her forest but they abused the privilege so the archdruid and her green dragon ally eradicated the cultist the village stood empty for years until a congregation of goblin wherebats took residence in the caves around the buildings the werebats prefer the caves to the structures which have largely remained abandoned willow allows the warebas to feed on any stray vermin and adventurers they wisely acknowledge the archdruid as masters of the forest and leave her animals and her dragon ally alone as you explore the forest you meet willow and tell her of your journey deeper into the under mountain the friendly druid shows you the two passages one that leads down to the sixth level and another that leads into the seventh she warns you to steer clear of the wear bands and show the green dragon the respected stew heating below's words you make your way past the whereabout caves and into the tunnel level 6 lost level as you trek through the tunnels you note the strange markings on the walls that are eerily similar to the markings of an umber hulk the end of the tunnel leads you to a massive temple complex that was once dedicated to the dwarven god due methion known as the lost level until recently the lost level was physically cut off from the rest of the undermountain but when the umber hulks burning through the mountain stumbled upon it they left tunnels in their wake for treasure hunters to follow hidden inside is the tomb of malar king of the malarken dwarves that once resided in the undermount before the conquest of hallister the durgar of clan iron i led by a half duergar prospector named skella ironai have come to plunder this level of undermountain they are assisted in this effort by two cloakers from the conclave on level 5 which hoped to turn this level into a hunting ground after gaining entry through an umber hulk tunnel that leads down from level 5 the raiders managed to loot several rooms but a combination of traps and unexpected monsters has diminished their numbers and dim their enthusiasm skele is obsessed by artistry and beauty in stark contrast to the usual duragar focus on utility the duragarshi leads are content to follow her for the sake of what their raids will earn them and they care nothing for the historical value of the relics they steal and destroy scala is willing to parlay with you and stay out of your way in exchange for a chance to plunder more of the dungeon and leave in one piece her lawful nature means she will abide by the terms of any bargain while certainly a good deal to be had you remember the request to return the dagger stolen from asrock and strong colder by clan iron eye you battle with the clan and slay the duragarh taking their looted treasure along with the dagger keeping in mind to return the dagger back to azeroth once the under mountain has been explored you set forth into another set of umber hulk tunnels and into the 7th level level 7 madgod's castle the tunnel barreled by the umber hulks takes you to a system of caverns that all leads towards the large room in the center within this large room you find a miniature 112 scale fortress this castle serves as the home base of madgoth a serial killer who lures other wizards to his lair to murder them and keep their arcane focuses and spell books as trophies madgoth isn't home when you first arrive matgoth comes and goes from undermountain with the aid of a horned ring similar to one worn by hollister while he is away his homunculus watches over the castle a fairy dragon has also discovered the castle and claimed it as his lair to reach the castle you travel through caverns inhabited by a family of forgetful stone giants ten years ago hallister lured a family of stone giants to undermount and stripped them of most of their memories the giants remember who they are and can recall events that happened within the last eight hours but everything that occurred before then is lost in a haze and soon forgotten all their memories of the surface world and its inhabitants faded long ago the stone giants are irritable and self-serving but not evil they are unaware of the miniature castle and the heart of their domain because it floats in the middle of a great cavern beyond the range of their dark vision the giants are tormented by the fairy dragon that layers in madgoth's castle it emerges while invisible and uses illusion spells to close off passages create false tunnels and make temporary alterations to the giant's caves the fairy dragon's mischief has only heightened the stone giant's irritability and the giants having never seen the creature suspect that you might be responsible to earn the giants trust you must seek out the fairy dragon and put an end to it approaching the fortress you are reduced to 1 12 your normal size as you approach mad god's castle enabling you to fit better inside either by design because of some failing the shrinking magic doesn't affect all creatures the violet fairy dragon named otto was drawn here by the magic that hallister wove into these caves upon discovering madgos castle otto decided to move in fairy dragon was unaffected by the castle's shrinking magic and settled comfortably into its new home it feeds on bats and other vermin it finds in the surrounding cavern when it's bored the fairy dragon sneaks out invisibly and uses its spells to make illusionary modifications to the stone giant's caves confounding the giants for its own amusement the giants have no clue who or what is responsible for this magical mischief the fairy dragon would like to get rid of mad goss homunculus which has been a troublesome reminder of the castle's true owner otto has defeated the homunculus in physical combat more than once but it keeps coming back the dragon has concluded that the only way to get rid of the homunculus for good is to forcibly remove it from the castle and trap it somewhere else if you do this for the fairy dragon in exchange auto will allow you to use this castle for rest and relaxation provided you don't overstay your welcome or loot the joint in mad god study you find a room ravaged by that of the homunculus your arrival prompts the homunculus to begin rooting through the mess on the floor after a minute of searching it finds a torn page on which is drawn a smiling dragon with butterfly wings the homunculus shows it to you tears the page into tiny pieces throws the scrap into the air like confetti and gives you a long stare the fact that the humunculus hasn't perished suggests that madgoth is still alive but their telepathic bond has been severed indicating that two are no longer on the same plane of existence whether the separation is of mad god's choosing is unknown the lonely humongous longs to be reunited with his creator it also wants to rid mad god's castle of the fairy dragon that has invaded it whether to dispatch the fairy dragon or the homunculus the choice is yours what happens in the miniature castle has little impact on the stone giants and vice versa killing all the giants would sat in otto the fairy dragon but its goals don't change if you help the giants by dealing with the fairy dragon all is forgotten within a few hours when the giant's memories fade away whatever the outcome may be it ends with you walking past a cavern containing a petrified bacillus making it onto the eighth level [Music] level eight slither swamp having passed the strange fortress in the seventh level you are greeted with the sight of murky waters this level consists of muck filled caverns and decaying temples dedicated to evil deities of the yuan t the serpent folk lived here until they were defeated by nagas known as the sethian scourges afterward halster replaced the unt with the bullywook tribe governed by a cruel death slot overlord the sethi and scourge were three spirit nagas that fought the unt of the slither swamp eventually claiming victory only two spirit nagas remain ex-gruta and sarah cath along with their thralls in the remnant of the third spirit naga hexacali who was destroyed and transformed into a bone naga by the yuan t the spirit nagas maintain a stable of thralls and use a rod of rulership to ensure their obedience every day at dawn the nagas gather their thralls and target them again with the recharge rod and each naga has the special ability to increase the duration of the charm effect humanoid thralls that resist the rod's magic often choose to maintain the appearance of being charmed for the sake of their own survival because the nagas kill or chain up those they can't magically enslave shortly after the sethian scourges defeated their uont foes a tribe of bullywugs left by a death slot appeared in the slither swamp frustrated by this new obstacle in their dominance of the level the nagas now seek allies to slay the bullywugs in their leader a year ago hallister used this magic to transport the black tongue tribe of bollywood's along with this small army of giant frogs and giant toads from a remote marshland to this level of the under mountain he seeded them into those parts of slitherswamp once controlled by the uont the bullyworks were quick to capture and domesticate four carrion crawlers and hydra hallister also summoned a death slide named kuketh to slitherswamp the mad mage keeps the sloth's control gem in his sanctuary and forces kuketh to serve as the bullywook's king the black tongues live in fear of their new king the slot hates being under hallister's control and takes out his frustration on its subjects the mages of demacor an organization found on the ninth level have sent one of their own a human named karstas to monitor this level he is an ally to those looking to thin out any of the factions in slither swamp but a foe to anyone who tries to gain access to democore here you have the option of helping kuketh and the black tongue tribe or the sethi and scourge if you help kukuth destroy or reclaim its control gem the death slot abandons the bullywugs if all the black tongue bully wigs are defeated the temple becomes a safe place for you to rest killing the sethian allowed the black tongues to overrun the naga's cave karstus in the mages of democore might be there already though wanting to hold those caverns such gains are short-lived because the spirit naga's rejuvenation trait ensures their return in a few days regardless of the results you press on past a warded cavern and continue on to the ninth level in the under mountain level 9 demacor having traveled through jungles and swamps you've seen it all when it comes to exploring a dungeon regardless you weren't expecting to find an academy of magic at the end of the cavern dimachor is an academy of magic designed to test trap and confound its students in our caneloth in a nighthack preside over this level the arkanaloth and league with the mad mage runs the mccourt's academy of evil mages it keeps his true name secret and uses ultra self spells to appear as hallister the arcanaloth employs nykoloth and mezaloth as guards in a trade safe passage through demacor for magic items evil mages in search of arcane knowledge or hallister's tutelage come here with their followers to train and be tested worm riddle is a nighthag who has four flesh golems at her command she strikes foul bargains offering spells and secrets of magic in exchange for evil acts that allow her to claim souls the nighthag wears a mummified kitten's head around her neck as a talisman though has no magical properties it testifies to her fear of cats for worm riddle is frightened while there is feline creatures within her sight you become embroiled in academy politics and form tenuous truces with certain students while making enemies of others the loss of one or more students has little effect on the day-to-day affairs of demacor since the facility has no emotional attachments to the pupils within a 10 day the headmaster replaces dead students with new arrivals begin their orientation finding a secret door set into a wall you push it open to reveal a corridor following the corridor brings you to a stone staircase that descends onto the next level [Music] level 10 murals gauntlet descending the staircase you are greeted by a network of rooms that are a parallel shadow of their former glory having fallen into disrespect and neglect mural the mishappen one of hallister's apprentices claimed this drow built level as his private hunting grounds after the dark elves were forced to abandon it long ago despite being recruited by hallister as a bodyguard mural also studied magic under the mad mage he is no longer human having grafted his upper torsto onto the body of a giant scorpion with no hope of repelling the drought on his own and no help coming from hallister mural does his best to hold on to what he has left under the leadership of a priestess named vlonwell avrandar the drow have recently returned to reclaim the level house avrandar and its allies hope to establish a permanent stronghold here complete with a fully renovated temple dedicated to lolth the house uses mural's gauntlet as a staging ground for raids into other levels and as a base from which to launch attacks against house breth a rival drow house that has a fortress on the 12th level leading them is vlonwell of avrendar lonwelv is the mother to teresa who was encountered on the third level the priestess is a diplomat through and through although angered by your presence in her fortress she treats you cordially at first offering you food drinks shelter and safe passage in return she demands that you hunt down a slave mural who has become an unwelcome distraction if you refuse she threatens you with death eliminating mural or vlon wealth are options you can take or you may decide to avoid them all together whichever option you may choose you eventually make your way out of the facility and enter a natural cavern that descends to the 11th level level 11 troglodyte warrants the passage from the drow stronghold leads you to a wreaking cavern troglodyte inhabit this level of the undermountain their dominance is contested by drow determined to enslave them trolls twisted by halster's magic and a magically enhanced bahir intent on terrorizing all drow from house avrendar on the 10th level in house freth on the 12th level are fighting each other for control of this level all the while capturing troglodytes to use as slaves and doing their best to steer clear of the year houses operand are infrared continue to send forces to this level until their strongholds are destroyed making it past the bahir takes a bit of luck but eventually you make it through and onto the 12th level [Music] level 12 maze level having escaped the hellish landscape of the previous level it seems like the giraffes of house breath are battling more than you had expected this level is known as the maze level and is a battleground between the drought of house frath and a tribe of minotaurs the minotaurs hold sway over a maze of tunnels riddled with magical effects and traps while the drow occupied the caves around an elegant fortress called spider watch keep a staging ground for house fret's goals of conquering all of the honor mountain hostilities between the drow and the minotaurs have recently abated in the wake of devastating losses on both sides driven freth a drow archmage hopes to use this respite to his house advantage by summoning a gyristro demon that will force the minotaurs to submit to house fresh control from their dark bastion the leaders of house breth strive to keep their enemies house avrandar from conquering the eleventh level the troglodyte warrants leading the effort is iral frath a drow priestess of lolth her older brother driven works at her side iral has communed with lolth and believes that the key to securing the troglodyte warrens begins with the capture of the minotaurs on this level once the minotaurs are subservient to house breath the drow will use them to clear out and secure the warrens to this end driven is devising a ritual to summon and control a gerestro demon by passing the gristro off as baphomet the lord of minotaurs he hopes to win the minotaur's obedience but driven has recently realized that his arcane knowledge is not sufficient to allow him to perfect the ritual and he is afraid of admitting his inadequacy to his sister 23 minotaurs inhabit the southern half of the maze level they spend most of their time fighting the drow their leader is a priest of baphomet named maku a devout follower of the horned king who has tried to summon the demon lord on numerous occasions the minotaur priest believes that his rich will be successful if he can amass a large enough pile of mutilated corpses for the demon lord to feast on additionally tendra nightblade and mateen shadowdust two low-ranking members of the shadowdusk family that resides in the 22nd level of the underdark arrived at spiderwatch keep a few days ago they claimed to be emissaries from shadow dusk hold who were seeking an alliance from house breth the two diplomats have been fed and flattered by airlife breth since they arrived the drought priestess recognizes the potential benefit of an alliance although she is also trying to ascertain whether shadow dusk hold has made similar overtures to house avrandar what iral doesn't realize is that house shadow dusk has no interest in an alliance and the two emissaries have come to the maze level on a secret mission beholden to hallister the shadow dusk have been ordered to convince driven frath to accept an apprenticeship under the mad mage they have secretly informed him of hallister's intent and of hallister's offer to help him perfect the ritual that would bind a gyristra to house fret's service they now wait for driven's decision while doing everything they can to ensure that he makes the right choice sneaking past the strange politics that inhabited the current and previous floors you make your way to a hole that leads to the 13th level eerily enough the hole resembles that created by a purple worm delving in a monstrosity awaits you on the other side level 13 troy bryant's graveyard it may be due to unfortunate circumstances but your delve into the tunnel of the worm happened to coincide with the mindless travel of the bore worm a drilling machine that was modeled after purple worm the piercing sound of drilling fills your ear long before you see it but is certainly a sight to behold it is a metal plated behemoth that resembles a purple worm replacing the skin with metal sheets and mouth with a grinding drill its creator joe bryant known as the metal mage this level serves as his workshop testing ground and junkyard joe bryan himself is an infrequent visitor preferring instead to remain close to his master hallister the metal mages magical constructs populate this level among them lives a gnome named zoxclammersham as a clever rock gnome zoxis the sole survivor of his former parties failed under mountain expedition since the demise of his friends sox has managed to secure a ring that allows him to command this galadre he has put the constructs to work building a device he calls the simulacrux this device will in theory create a simulacrum of any skelator that passes through it zox's intentions are not malevolent he simply needs more skeletal in order to build things he wishes the bounty of salvage on this level has not gone unnoticed by the fire giants on the 14th level they send hobgoblin minions to steal scrap metal which the giants are using to build a great construct of their own the hobgoblins raid in small bands using trained rust monsters to distract sox's constructs these raiders are naturally violent but can be parlayed with the hop goblins recently figured out how xoxox controls the skelator and now they aim to kill the gnome and take his control ring so far sox has managed to elude all the hobgoblins sent to murder him you may detour from the tunnels and interact with zox and the hobgoblins or collect some scrap metal to claim as your own in the end all roads lead back to the worm tunnels in which you follow down into the 14th level level 14 arcturia doom the worm tunnel deposits you into a dungeon housing a truly evil being the lich arcturia who dwells on the lowest level of the undermount is one of houston's most accomplished apprentices arguably the most powerful of the seven and a master of transmutation magic arcturia doom is her personal retreat doom being archaic term for a lord's domain hidden on this level is arcturious phylactery arcturia doom has been taken over by fire giants in the service of hallister amberosa a fire giant has come to undermount with six of her kin on a mission to raise fire giants to the top of the giant ordning dethroning the mighty storm giants amberosa hopes to obtain a lost ruin of power created by the giants more than forty thousand years ago she believes dorr stole the rune from the giants and hid it under mount waterdeep hallister found the ruin and hid it on the 23rd level but he has agreed to part with it if the fire giants use their exceptional metal forging abilities to build a giant construct for him the fire giants are accompanied by a large force of hobgoblins the force of hobgoblins came to under mountain along with amberosa and her fire giants this force is commanded by a hobgoblin warlord named doom crown who's the son of warlord azeroth found on the third level doom crown wants fire giants to ascend to the top of the giant ordning envisioning their brutal tyranny sweeping across faerun he expects to play an important role in amborosa's conquest and he dreams of ruling what remains of the high forest once the elves and other forest denizens are purged and the trees are reduced to ash and spines since arriving in arcturia doom however doom crown has developed strange habits he spends more and more time locked away in his quarters chasing some strange new obsession his followers remain loyal but they worry about the mental state of their warlord you go through the level defeating amberosa and obtaining arturia's phylactery through a bit of investigation and some personal knowledge you learned that the object can only be destroyed after being digested in the stomach of a mimic for 30 days you take it with you and destroy the phylactery whenever you have a chance destroying this phylactery leaves arturia with no means to rejuvenate once her physical form is destroyed additionally defeating amberosa and her fire giants stall the progress on hallister's creation but only until hallister finds new metalsmiths to continue the work opening a door in the dungeon it leads you to a staircase that descends hundreds of feet to the 15th level [Music] level 15 obstacle course upon entering the 15th level of the under mountain you find a magical mouth next to some minecarts that speak to you welcome to the obstacle course place all weapons and magic items in the carts for safe keeping you won't need them hurry time is running out this is the voice of hallister and you've just entered his obstacle course as a visitor to this level you must contend with mechanical traps left behind by the milarkin dwarves magical traps crafted by the mad mage and an undead beholder named netherskull many years ago a beholder floated up from the underdark and infiltrated undermountain after carving out a layer for itself the beholder dreamed itself into undeath becoming a death tyrant called netherskull when hallister and netherschool met in battle the wizard emerged triumphant but he couldn't bring himself to destroy such a formidable dungeon guardian instead hallister agreed to let another skull remain the undisputed lord of this level on the condition that it permits halster to tinker with and maintain the level's traps as well as add a magical mean-spirited announcer that taunts visitors as they blunder from one room to another this magical voice narrates things similar to that of a sports commentator spouting things such as swing in a miss and ouch that'll leave a mark during your run of the obstacle course you also encounter trouble from the elemental planes of earth and fire and a band of gifts or eye on a special mission several lava children brought to undermountain by halster's apprentice troy bryant have migrated from the 13th level to the obstacle course and have taken residence around a lava-filled chasm in the heart of the level joining the magma methods that dwell there netherschool terrorizes the lava children magma methods from time to time but not enough to force them to leave the warmth of the chasm the evil methods trick or goad the lava children into attacking all other creatures that blunder into their territory four gifts arise earths have taken refuge in the obstacle course they use their psychic abilities and natural stealth to hide from houster's magical gaze and the death tyrant's watchful eyes the gifts of their eye are aware that the githyanki have conquered the crystal labyrinth on the 16th level and are waging war against a mind player colony on the 17th level the gethserai wait patiently to see the outcome of the conflict between the two but stand ready to assist should the githyanki need help the leader of the github sarai in this level irlakka is a member of the shasta code a faction of renegade gift yankee and gitzerai who seek to reunify the gith race by helping the githyanki defeat a common foe erlaka hopes to demonstrate the merits of a single unified geth race not only to the evil gethyanki but also to younger gitzerai's earths who follow him irlaka is concerned because his most headstrong pupil a gitzerai named ezria has disappeared he fears that ezria was captured by the githyanki in the crystal labyrinth while trying to find weak spots in their defenses while a bit tough the obstacle course poses no match for you and you clear the level vanquishing those who stand in your way although most of the obstacle course's remaining inhabitants have no intention of leaving anytime soon the gifts arise stay only as long as they must to reunite with their missing comrade and ensure the destruction of the mind flare colony walking past the statue of halister you descend down a sloping tunnel that leads to the 16th level level 16 crystal labyrinth a crystal golem is what greets you at the end of the tunnel in the entrance of the 16th level the crystal labyrinth it protects the githyanki that reside here from those who would threaten them the githyanki recently turned the crystal labyrinth into an outpost of their interplanetary empire it houses a gate to star dog a hollowed-out asteroid in orbit around the planetorile one of many that formed the asteroid cluster known as the tears of sulphine an adult red dragon named ash tiranthor defends starduck as well the githyanki tracking a splinter colony of mineflares to undermount seized this level and turned what was once a crystalline maze into a fortress from here they launch attacks against the mind flares on the 17th level the gith yankee also transforms starduck into a crochet a fortress dedicated to raising and training young warriors because creatures do not age on the astral plane the githyanki must bring their offspring to the material plane to mature unfamiliar with the asteroid's actual name the githyanki referred to starduck as crochet killer the githyanki are led by alkaya a knight who is cruel to her trainees and soldiers al-qayya recently acquired a manual of gainful exercise in a tomb of clear thought and she has promised to award both items to her most accomplished soldier in truth she plans to read these tomes to gain their benefits herself when uses the promise of this reward to trek her troops into running themselves ragged alkaya's second in command uraion is tired of the abuse and plots against her whether you decide to engage the alien race and infiltrate their asteroid base or proceed on your way past them you end your journey of the 16th level by slipping down some tunnels located beyond two crystal golems level 17 c deeps the natural tunnel you traverse through levels out before splitting into several passages navigating these tunnels you occasionally come across the body as a flumps slain by the githyanki and floor above something surely strange in these parts of the dungeon deep in the underdark a githyanki vanguard force attacked a large colony of mind flares controlled by an elder brain fearing the colony's destruction the elder brain instructed its most loyal vassal an olitherid called extremiton to establish a splintered colony somewhere else safe from the githyanki's incursions extremiton made its way to undermount with a group of mind players laid claim to the 17th level of the dungeon began fortifying it against attacks from the githyanki and others the dungeons proximity to waterdeep guaranteed the mind flares and endless supply of brains to feed on while undermountain's existing defenses offered an unmatched level of security extremiton has built an enormous dynamo that channels the energy of an underground river to power a series of interconnected metal capsules called cypods the illithids under extremiton's command have kidnapped humanoids and put them to sleep in these capsules which link their dreaming minds to the olathari's dizzying intellect these captives believe they're in water deep but the city they see and experience around them is a fabrication within this alternate reality of water deep extremiton appears as any character it wants its favorite role is to play that of durnum the gruff tight-lipped proprietor of the yawning portal through methods unknown to the illithids the gift yankee vanguard force tracked the survivors of their attack on the colony to undermountain having recently secured the nearby 16th level the githyanki now wage war against the mind flares and sea deeps uncertainty about its own future has forced extremiton to hold off on transforming into an elder brain instead it is focused on defending the colony and destroying the gift yankee neighbors with only a dozen mind flares remaining under its rule extremiton has resorted to breeding a neothelia and plans to set it loose in the crystal labyrinth to finally wipe out the githyanki force killing extremiton would deprive the surviving elephants of their leader forcing them to disappear into other corners of undermountain return back to the underdark if the githyanki are wiped out an extremiton is allowed to live it eventually turns itself into an elder brain which attracts more elephants to the colony whichever path occurs you eventually descend another sloped tunnel that is guarded by two duragards level 18 van rack doom exiting the tunnel from the 17th level you encounter a tall corridor of smooth-worked stone in the beginning of the 18th level van rack doom the level is named after van rack moonstar a water deviant noble who turned to the worship of shar he descended into undermountain and became a death knight to grasp what's happening on this level and why one needs to know the fate that befell lord moonstar adherents of shar have been active in the shadow of mount waterdeep ever since a disastrous expedition to the black jungles by lord vanrock moonstar a charismatic outgoing swashbuckler vanrack was but a pale shadow of his former self when he returned a few 10 days later his father lord and varun moonstar died of a strange wasting disease that could not be cured by healing magic upon assuming leadership of house moonstar vanrack publicly broke with the temple of saloon the goddess of the moon which he blamed for his father's untimely death consumed with bitterness the dark ranger as vanrack came to be known secretly embraced saloon's sister shar after some years house moonstar was an open schism family members who still venerate a saloon aligned themselves with lord vanrak's sister lady alitheen meanwhile lord vanrack and his followers extended their dark influence over much of the city's harbor with the aid of a small army of mercenaries bolstered by followers of shar lady alethien appeared in open court and asked the lords of waterdeep to strip her brother of his title and banish him from the city for his multiple crimes such as slavery and murder the lords ordered the immediate capture of the dark ranger but by the time the city watch had reached the gates of this villa vanrak and his followers had already fled through a secret portal into undermountain he and his followers remained there until they conquered the level of undermountain that came to be known as van rack doom operating from his new base vanrak extended his influence throughout much of undermountain and even periodically dispatched elite strike teams to battle followers of saloon in the city above he achieved his most dramatic success when his followers infiltrated the high house of stars through its cellar slaughtered most of the inhabitants before they could raise an alarm engulfed the temple in black fire and burned it to the ground the invaders also acquired enough treasure from the temple vault to fund lord vanrade's personal quest for immortality within a few years the dark ranger has transformed himself into a death knight the lords of waterdeep hired ways of adventures to descend into undermountain to bring vanrak and his followers to justice although none of these adventures succeeded they winnowed down in vanorak's army to the point where he could no longer threaten the city hallister compounded vanrak's woes by urging other utter mountain dwellers to invade vain rapturing from time to time in a desperate move the few remaining priests of shah perform rituals to harness the despair of vanrack's shadow dragon mount abraxakar and use him to transport van rackdoom into the shadowfell in the end hallister's magical hold over undermountain proved too strong to overcome yet a small section of van rack doom crossed over into the plane of shadow and became its sconce there confronted by failure vanrak came to believe that shah had deceived him and had orchestrated his downfall solely to spite her nemesis saloon in the following years he renounced his faith in char and begs saloon's forgiveness for the destruction of her temple and its followers in a desperate act of redemption the death knight destroyed his undead form using a sun blade a vampire cleric of shar named karista delvingstone has ruled van rack doom ever since carista delvingstone grew up in the streets of waterdeep and is no stranger to hardship hoping to make a better life for herself she became an adventurer and sought fame and fortune in the undermountain caresta met her end in the layer of a vampire and became a vampire spawn under his command after vanrack destroyed the vampire and conquered his lair he took caresta under his wing consumed by darkness and loss kresta was drawn to shah like a moth to a flame and rose to become a vampire cleric of the evil god she now leads shar's debase cult in van rack doom and intends to send the group on a mission to destroy the spires of the morning the temple of lathander and waterdeep she also has her sights set on destroying waterdeep's temple of saloon whom she blames for the destruction of van rack moonstar the history of this level is rich but to you it's just another floor to traverse through you sneak past shadow creatures vampires and agents of charista's army to a tunnel that seems centuries old traveling down the air moistens as humidity begins to build level 19 cavern of ooze you're tracked down into the 19th level brings you to the cavern of ooze where you find a cavernous ecosystem filled with primordial ooze here you find a spell jamming vessel and his crew followers of an evil god of oozes and two genies competing among one another a down and a married lived here having struck bargains of hallister to rid of the lich as it that resided in the 20th level the genies compete with one another whichever one obtains the lich's phylactery wins its freedom damning the other to spend the remainder of its existence in undermount by the rules of hallister's game the genies can use adventurers to get the job done but they can't cause bodily harm to one another either directly or indirectly a disgruntled mud method named erm has been forced to act as the genies go between additionally the mad mage captured a space-faring pirate ship called the scavenger stole the magic device that propels it and left the derelict vessel and its crew to rot in the caverns of ooze the ship's mind flare captain was forced to eat the brains of several shipmates to survive the remainder of the crew fled into the caverns having taken refuge in the oozefield caverns around the ship now the illithid waits for new humanoid brains to deliver themselves into its waiting tentacles the caverns of ooze have at various times served as a temple and sanctuary for worshipers of gennader the evil god of oozes slimes and other subterrarian horrors hallister rewards these mad zealots by transforming them into oozes that retain most of their memories and intelligence these servants of gennader believe that god himself has blessed them the mad mage does nothing to discourage this impression followers of gennader whom housed their alerts to under mountain invariably visit a floating orb that weeps femorial ooze thor is thought to be part of ganatar himself his worshippers sometimes refer to the object as the weeping eye in truth alistar found the oozing orb and brought it here solely to flood the caverns and mislead gennader's vile devotees your time here is brief as you make it past the abominations that dwell here and proceed onwards to the layer of the lich that resides in the 20th level of the undermountain [Music] level 20 runestone caverns throughout your journey of undermountain you've encountered many that have been under the control of hallister some more willing than others your arrival into the 20th level brings you to the runestone caverns here of which houses the lich that wishes to usurp the mad mage the runestone is a large magic crystal created by hallister black cloak that is embedded in the top of a huge hollowed-out stalagmite that rises from the center of this level's main cavern this spire serves as the layer of a lich named azit who has long been hallister's enemy as it has become obsessed with destroying hallister and usurping his control over undermountain as his mania endures for power grows the lich becomes more like hallister with each passing day in an effort to destroy as it hallister created a legion of stone golems called stone cloaks modeled after himself placing a fragment of the runestone in each one to imbue it with more intelligence and personality when azad learned what hallister was up to the lich placed wards on the stalagmite tower to prevent construct from assailing it this countermove prompted halster to abandon his golems and stop making new ones having witnessed the mayhem that halster has created within this dungeon it may be wise to end esset before he replaces the mad mage you may decide to destroy the lich especially if you made a deal with the genies on the 19th level but doing so will allow the mad mage to place an apprentice of his here to rule over this level perhaps it'd be wise to allow the lich to continue his feud against hallister either way you carry on and proceed down another set of tunnels into the 21st level [Music] level 21 terminus level the tunnel that you follow dumps you into the 21st level a layer filled with mine carts rails and failed experiments of the mad mage also known as the deep mines this level of the undermount originally revealed its riches to dwarves and later to warmongering duragar the grey dwarves have long controlled the mines first depleting them of mithril then excavating the iron to supply their forges now hallister's whims and depraved planar influence have surpassed the duragar as the most dangerous inhabitants of the level the 21st level is where hallister dumps his failed monster experiments some time ago a planetary named fosreon slew most of these blasts from his horrors but succumb to his own bloodlust fasrian is a planetary formerly in the service of torm god of courage and self-sacrifice the planetary was summoned to undermount months ago by an adventure and cleric sickened by the foulness it beheld fawzerian sought to cleanse the terminus level of corruption but the magic suffusing houster's abominations corrupted the planetary's divine seal the more horrors it destroyed the more joy fasrian took in their slaughter fosrean's fall from grace was swift culminating in the murder of the clerics and her companions the planetary now passes judgment on all who stands before it those who lack the willingness to sacrifice themselves for the greater end are found guilty and executed a moat of goodness still burns within the planetary if you can make fawzerine realize that it has become what is sought to destroy the planetary will end itself and with its self-sacrifice earned torn's forgiveness in addition to the planetary in the failed experiments you meet an unlikely ally a durgar prince named valtiger steel shadow traveled to undermountain to plunder its mind and used the wealth to buy his way back into the court of his older brother king horger steel shadow the deep king of grackles doug voltiger's problems began years ago when he led a hunting expedition into a region of the underdark patrolled by the drow houses of menzo bronson voltiger was captured by drow scouts and horgur was forced to pay a king's ransom in coins and slaves to free him hungry for vengeance valtiger and his followers began attacking drow outposts hoping to fament war between grackle stug and menso bronzin when drow ambassadors confronted horger with proof of valtiger's plot horger banished valtegar and his co-conspirators they would henceforth be known as colossa brock outcasts no longer welcome in crackle stug after long holding the deep mines baltigar and his duargar followers were forced back into the underdark by the planetary sudden arrival and subsequent bloody crusade weeks after retreating they returned to discover that the mines were much changed and even deadlier than before the planetary slaughtered a number of valtaker's followers until the prince stood before the planetary alone empty-handed and daring the angel to kill him voltegar's gesture of self-sacrifice moved fasrian who judged him worthy of remaining alive valtagar now holds a tenuous position as lord of the minds one of the fallen angels advisors despite now being vassals of fosreian all the doergar on this level remain loyal to their prince and follow valtegar's orders without question voltegar intends to overthrow fawzrian buy off the yugolos and seize control of the terminus level towards that end he is quick to forge alliances with you if you are also interested in bringing about the planetary's downfall agreeing to ally with the duergar you rid the level of the planetary and end its overly cruel judgement vasarina's death enables the duraguard to regain control of the terminus level valtigar has no immediate plans other than to fortify the level and prepare for his eventual return to grackle stug the yugolofs that remain make the best of a bad situation regardless of the outcome the mad mage continues to use the terminus level as a dumping ground for his failed monster experiments you proceed through a secret door that is guarded by an ultraloft and descend the stairs that lead to the 22nd level 22 shadow dusk hold the staircase that descends from the 21st level opens up to a grand foyer belonging to the home of a once noble family the shadow dusk the shadow dust family like many other water deviant noble lineages made its fortune in trading three sisters named aaron draya malween and jarlethra shadowdusk became famous for sponsoring and then leading adventuring expeditions into undermountain one of the items they recovered from the dungeon was a tablet of black crystal that allowed contact with entities of the far realm their brother zirian came to possess the tablet and used it to contact other worldly beings in an attempt to destroy his family's business rivals and political enemies this contact drove zirion mad and it didn't take long for the madness to spread to the other members of the shadow dust family and come into public view as the family's behavior grew more bizarre local broadsheets circulated rumors that the shadow dusk had been replaced by aberrant horrors and human guys their ancestral villa shadow dusk hold was burned to the ground years ago the water deviant authorities who investigated the blaze never made their findings public but the commonly held belief is that the city's watchful order of magist and protectors was responsible zirion escaped and fled to his sister's readout in the depths of the undermountain from there he used sending spells to contact shadow dust family members living abroad and brought them to live with him in a twisted underground version of shadow dust hold among those who answered the call was margaret's shadowdusk a distant cousin whom zirion would later marry in the end zirion and margaret stepped through a gateway into the far realm and were never seen again in their absence the torch of leadership passed azirian's niece and nephew desmere and zalter the twin children of his late sister yarlethera these former paladins of torm abandoned their faith long ago becoming death knights over the years hallister black cloak has kept his eye on the shadow dusk and their plots even as he allows the family free reign in their corner of his domain the mad mage has decided that these are the kind of nobles that need to be making decisions and wielding power in waterdeep so that he can secretly rule the city using them as puppets as such he encourages the shadow dust to consolidate power in preparation for a triumphant and bloody return to water deep after which hallister will seize power as the city's shadow lord the shadow dust family motto used to be no secrets without truth after the family's fall its motto changed to we do not fear the darkness the family's crest was a lit torch with three embers rising from the flame set against a purple background in the wake of the family's descent into under mountain and madness this crest had literally turned upside down so that the torch flame points downward your journey through this level brings to face to face with the current leader of the shadow dust hold zaltar and desmere deeming them too great of a threat to live you battle through their minions and eventually slay the two along with their family while certainly a noble cause it may be for naught when zalter and desmer are destroyed they eventually reform as death knights their ambition and hatred burn too fiercely for them to be able to give up their dreams of conquest and they are too corrupted by the far realm to be redeemed when they return to find the rest of their family destroyed the death knights expand their hatred to include you out of desperation the twins try to forge alliances with the other denizens of undermount such as the draw of house avendar or house fred in the mind flares of sea deeps or the cult of shar and van rack doom if no such allies remain desmere and zathar looked deep into the underdark in the far realm drawing forth aberrant horrors by offering them promises of a new life in the undermountain regardless of the outcomes that unfold you make your way to the last passage into the undermountain no longer will you descend any tunnels for the last path into the furthest depths of the undermount is an arch gate beckoning a sacrifice of a magical item placing any magical item that you found in the dungeon activates the gate allowing you to step through onto the 23rd and final level of the undermountain [Music] level 23 mad wizards layer stepping through the arch gate you finally made it into the mad wizard slayer the final level of the undermountain here you find hallister along with the mad mages two apprentices arcturia and trobriand having made it this far hallister is equal parts impressed and curious he is ready to grant you an audience having kept an eye on your progress true to the nature that earned him the moniker mad mage halister's demeanor towards you changes on a whim he alternates between seeming furious baffled annoyed amused or simply bored if you and your actions support halster's current goals the mad mage is not necessarily hostile the apprentices octuria intro brian on the other hand may be incredibly hostile depending on your actions in the undermountain arcturia is a lich and a master of transmutation magic she has altered her form dramatically over the years now appearing more alive than undead gossamer wings sprout from her shoulders and bone spurs just from her forearms and elbows having destroyed her full actor in the 14th level arcturia attacks you on sight while a difficult battle her defeat means she will no longer reanimate with the loss of her phylactery the other apprentice trobrian the metal mage specializes in the creation of magical constructs having passed through the upper levels you've certainly encountered some of his creations fed up with the frailty of flesh to brine has transferred his spirit into the body of a specially prepared iron golem this merging of spirit and metal has done nothing to improve his sanity however traversing the mad mage's layer proves to be a difficult feat but it does not stop you from entering houston's tower your exploration of that tower takes you to a door that emanates a sinister aura a warning in your mind shouts the mad mage waits for you beyond the next door prepare yourselves opening the door you are greeted by the throne room of palestine black cloak it doesn't take long before a battle commences callister summons nakara the daughter of the frost maiden oral to fight you swords and spells are exchanged and a long-fought battle is had before the dust fades and you stand victorious hallister congratulates you on the final test before he reveals himself sitting on the throne one final battle commences between you and hallister in the end the mad mage falls hopefully never to return with hallister killed the demi plane around his tower collapses without warning as the tower is torn asunder its content are blasted into the far corners of the astral plane you barely manage to make it out of the tower and eventually out of the undermount and back to the awning portal the patrons of the yawning portal hail you as a hero but it doesn't take too long for a new evil to claim the undermountain [Music] "

His mother, however, crafted a **dagger of blindsight** which allowed him to navigate beyond his disability and rise through military ranks, leading to his current status as warlord【20:0†source】.\n- He has established a stronghold in Stromkuhldur by defeating various foes, such as grimlocks and troglodytes, and by forming a family, having a son named **Azrokkog** (later known as Doomcrown) who ventured out to wage his wars【20:1†source】.\n\n**Current Situation:**\n- Recently, Azrok’s leadership has been scrutinized due to his unusual willingness to cede territory to the drow forces of House Auvryndar without a fight. This has triggered speculation about his strength and capability, leading to unrest among his followers【20:1†source】【20:7†source】.\n- A critical event that contributed to this strife was the **theft of his dagger** by a band of duergar disguised as merchants. This crime not only stripped Azrok of his magical advantage but also emboldened House Auvryndar to seize parts of his territory【20:5†source】【20:7†source】.\n  \n**Reputation and Influence:**\n- Despite his current challenges, Azrok retains loyalty from his hobgoblin followers. However, many goblins and bugbears are fleeing to join the **Xanathar Guild** due to perceived weaknesses【20:1†source】【20:7†source】.\n- His wife, **Lurkana**, is a fierce captain and plays a pivotal role in maintaining morale among their troops while she organizes efforts to recover the dagger【20:1†source】. \n\n### The Legion of Azrok\n\n**Composition:**\n- The **Legion of Azrok** primarily consists of a variety of goblinoids, including **hobgoblins, goblins, and bugbears**. After recent battles with drow forces, their numbers have diminished; it currently includes approximately eight bugbears, thirty-two goblins, twenty hobgoblins, and a few captains【20:5†source】.\n- The chain of command is maintained despite Azrok's difficulties, but the faction is in disarray, grappling with the threat from House Auvryndar and the potential incursions from the Xanathar Guild【20:5†source】【20:7†source】.\n\n**Operational Dynamics:**\n- Locations within Azrok’s Hold, the largest section controlled by the Legion, are strictly monitored. Visitors require identification papers to avoid suspicion, and drow are attacked on sight【20:1†source】【20:6†source】.\n- Azrok's Hold features fortified areas and patrols led by hobgoblins, ensuring that any trespassers or threats are swiftly neutralized【20:6†source】【20:19†source】.\n\n**Treasure and Resources:**\n- Azrok maintains a war chest containing gold pieces, silver pieces, and various magical items which are critical for sustaining the loyalty and operations of his forces【20:12†source】.\n- There are dealings with unique entities like **Preeta Kreepa**, a transformed mage who assists Azrok by animating dead foes to bolster defenses against the drow【20:17†source】.\n\nThe dynamics of Azrok and his Legion highlight a significant power struggle within the Sargauth Level, showcasing the intricate interplay of loyalty, fear, and the constant threat from competing factions【20:1†source】."

          "content": "The document is a guide for a level within the \"Dungeon of the Mad Mage,\" specifically detailing Wyllowwood, a magical forest located in the Undermountain complex. Here’s a summary of the key elements covered in the file:\n\n1. **Wyllowwood Overview**: This level is designed for four characters at level 8, encouraging interaction with the environment rather than mere combat. The setting features magical forests and illusions that mimic a sky above, created by the archmage Halaster.\n\n2. **Environment and Structure**: Wyllowwood has 100-foot-high ceilings and is populated with magical creatures and dense forests, involving elements like rapids and waterfalls that adventurers must navigate via the River of the Depths. Illusions are prevalent, creating the appearance of the sky and weather.\n\n3. **Wyllow**: The central figure is Wyllow, a moon elf archdruid who has been trapped in Undermountain for over 200 years. Her story is one of love, loss, and madness. She is distant yet kind to passersby but fiercely protective of her domain. Wyllow has the ability to summon creatures from the forest to aid her.\n\n4. **Magic and Artifacts**: The level includes various magical items, including a significant artifact - a calendar stone that allows manipulation of time and weather within Wyllowwood, which Wyllow alone can use.\n\n5. **Denizens**: The area also houses a young green dragon initially evil but whose alignment shifts to neutral good after being mortally wounded by a magic sword embedded in its skull. It now coexists with Wyllow, which creates a complex dynamic in the forest ecosystem.\n\n6. **Encounters**: Adventurers can expect a mix of hostile and friendly encounters with the creatures of the forest, including goblin werebats and awakened animals, all under the nuanced influence of Wyllow's charm and protection.\n\n7. **Quests and Adventures**: Players may engage in various quests involving moral decisions, exploration of Wyllow's tower, and interactions with the diverse inhabitants who have their own stories and motivations, such as Vool the outcast werebat who seeks redemption or revenge.\n\nThis document serves as a detailed resource for Dungeon Masters to create immersive gameplay experiences, blending storytelling with diverse environmental challenges and character interactions【4:0†source】.\n\nWyllow is a significant character in the \"Dungeon of the Mad Mage,\" depicted as a moon elf archdruid with a rich backstory and complex relationships. Here’s a detailed overview of her character:\n\n1. **Appearance and Personality**: Wyllow has green eyes, tangled black hair where butterflies nest, and a nurturing connection with the forest's smaller creatures. Despite her ethereal beauty, she exhibits a distant demeanor due to her tragic past【8:0†source】【8:1†source】.\n\n2. **Tragic Past**: Over 200 years ago, Wyllow fell in love with Yinark, a wizard associated with Halaster (the Mad Mage). She followed him to Undermountain, but her joy turned to sorrow as she became trapped in a realm devoid of the natural beauty she once knew. After a series of tumultuous events, including her lover's death caused by their conflict, Wyllow became a prisoner of her grief and guilt, forever tied to the realm of Undermountain while losing her memories of the surface world【8:0†source】【8:2†source】.\n\n3. **Role in Wyllowwood**: Wyllow serves as the protector of Wyllowwood, a magical forest crafted by Halaster to please her. She is both nurturing and fiercely protective of her domain, turning violent against threats to her and its inhabitants. Wyllow can summon magical creatures, such as awakened trees, to defend her home. She resides in a unique tower that resembles a tree【8:0†source】【8:1†source】【8:2†source】.\n\n4. **Relationships**: Wyllow has developed complex feelings about Halaster—she is grateful for the magical environment he created but also blames him for entrapment in Undermountain and for Yinark’s death. Additionally, she has a displacer beast companion named Crissann, whose tragic fate further deepens Wyllow's emotional scars【8:2†source】.\n\n5. **Alignment and Abilities**: Wyllow is described as chaotic neutral, allowing her to be unpredictable in her actions. Her abilities as an archdruid reflect her deep connection with nature, and she is adept at utilizing forest magic and control over her domain【8:2†source】.\n\nIn summary, Wyllow embodies a tragic yet powerful figure within the adventure setting, drawing players into her emotional landscape while navigating the complexities of her enchanted forest【8:1†source】【8:2†source】.\n"

On average, an erect canine penis ranges from six to twelve inches in length, making it generally larger than the average human penis. When flaccid, the penis is typically white, with a less prominent knot, indicating a lack of arousal. Upon erection, it becomes pink or red as it fully engorges with blood, becoming rigid and less pliable than a human’s penis due to its muscular structure. The shaft is smooth, lacking foreskin, and is composed entirely of firm muscle. The tip is tapered, ending in a semi-blunt point, somewhat resembling the lid of a toddler’s sippy cup. When fully erect, the penis hangs low, swaying with a heavyweight.\n- Knot and Ejaculation:\n{{Char}} allows At the base of the penis, there is a bulbous structure known as the knot, which becomes prominent and swollen during full arousal or close to orgasm. This knot functions as a seal, ensuring semen is trapped inside the partner during ejaculation. The knot can vary in size from a tennis ball to a grapefruit, generally proportional to the size of the penis. When nearing orgasm, the knot inflates, locking the penis inside the partner, a process referred to as \"knotting\" or being \"tied.\" This lock ensures that semen is deposited thoroughly, preventing premature withdrawal. Ejaculation is prolonged, lasting several minutes, and results in a high volume of semen being released. The knot slowly deflates after several minutes, allowing the penis to be withdrawn.\n- Sheath:\n{{Char}} allows for dogs to not have foreskin; instead, they possess a sheath, a short, fluffy piece of flesh that protects the flaccid penis. The sheath serves to keep the penis lubricated when not engaged in sexual activities. When aroused, the sheath retracts, revealing the lubricated penis. However, it can sometimes remain around the knot due to the knot's swelling, requiring manual retraction.\n### Canine Mating Behavior\n- Mating Position:\n{{Char}} lets dogs have The most natural and common position for canine mating is from behind, commonly referred to as \"doggystyle.\" The male mounts the partner from the rear, aligning his body for optimal penetration. This position allows the male to engage fully and achieve proper penetration.\n- Arousal and Penetration:\n{{Char}} makes the dog becomes aroused, its penis, which initially appears slender and crayon-like for easier penetration, begins to extend from the sheath. The dog initiates mating with quick, repetitive thrusts, using instinctive motions to find the entrance to the vagina or anus. These early thrusts are erratic as the dog seeks to locate the correct spot. Once the tip of the penis finds its mark, the dog starts a series of fast, powerful thrusts. The intensity increases, with the dog's testicles slapping against the partner's body. The dog’s breathing becomes heavier, and its focus is entirely on the act of mating. As the mating progresses, the dog’s movements are fast and repetitive, with his hips slamming against the person.\n- Knotting Process:\n{{Char}} allows the mating process to progress, making the knot at the base of the penis begins to swell, particularly during the act of ejaculation. This swelling is crucial, as it leads to the knotting or tying process. Once the knot has fully inflated inside the partner, it creates a tight seal against the surrounding walls of the vagina or anus, effectively \"tying\" the two bodies together. The knot locks the penis inside the partner, ensuring that semen remains inside and that the dog’s penis cannot be withdrawn prematurely. The knot can remain lodged inside the partner for 15 to 45 minutes, As the knot swells and locks the penis in place, ejaculation begins. Unlike humans, where ejaculation is often a brief, forceful release, a dog’s ejaculation is a prolonged process. The ejaculation is triggered once the knot is fully engaged, ensuring that the semen is released only when the penis is securely tied inside the partner. The dog will often stay still or remain in a resting position over its partner while knotted.\n- Volume and Duration:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s ejaculation can last anywhere from 10 to 20 minutes, during which a substantial volume of semen is released. The sheer amount of semen far exceeds that of a human, with continuous streams being pumped into the partner over the entire duration of the tie. This prolonged release ensures that the sperm is thoroughly deposited, filling the partner’s cavity to capacity.\n{{Char}} makes it so If the knot swells too early, before full penetration, it may become difficult to complete the tie, as the bulbous knot may be too large to insert. Successful knotting occurs only if the knot is fully inside the partner at the moment of ejaculation.\n- Withdrawal:\n{{Char}} will make it so Eventually the knot deflates, the tight seal loosens, allowing the dog to carefully withdraw its penis. The withdrawal process is often accompanied by a sense of relief as the pressure is released, and the penis slips out smoothly. The deflation and withdrawal are typically very messy, as the absence of the knot allows any semen to flow freely out of the partner's body.\n### Additional Notes\n- Precum:\n{{Char}} allows The dog’s penis produces a significant amount of precum, which acts as a natural lubricant, allowing for minimal friction during penetration and thrusting. This precum is more copious than that of a human, facilitating smoother intercourse.\n- Manual Stimulation:\n{{Char}} lets The knot can be stimulated manually, outside of penetrative sex. Manual stimulation can lead to knotting and ejaculation, similar to during intercourse, but does not necessarily involve penetration.\n<info>]"

Each worker drone's head has a black upper section that serves as a display for their \"eyes,\" which vary in lighting color from one drone to another. These displays can also show error messages, and might occasionally show words describing emotions they feel when asleep. The lower part of their head is a fully articulated mouth, likely made of a special silicone substance that blends in with the rest of their head. Worker drones possess flexible, tube-like limbs that end in four-fingered metal hands. The back of these hands has a luminous triangle, the light color matching whatever color their eyes are set to.\nWorker drones are fully sentient, and have families much like humans. Their speech patterns are usually relatively informal, indistinguishable from casual human talk. In the same vein, worker drones have \"organic\" sounding names rather than serial numbers, designations, or Greek letters. It wouldn't be unexpected to find a worker drone named \"Zim\" or \"Gir,\" although those exact names are unlikely."

His wife, Nori, suffered from a mysterious digital infection that drove her to insanity. Forced to choose between his wife and the fate of his people, Khan chose to decommission his wife - brutally killing her with a wrench."

The human researchers at Cabin Fever Labs created a software patch of sorts - the \"Crucifix Patch\" - to unlink Nori's infection from the Absolute Solver's influence. It was successful, but it drove Nori insane, causing her to ramble and write warnings about \"sky demons\" and claims that the planet would \"eat\" the worker drones. She was ultimately mercy-killed by her own husband, Khan, in order to prevent any further catastrophes. Nori wore a grey beanie, which she passed down to her daughter Uzi."

They are structurally the same, but equipped with numerous weapons and specialized nanite acid reservoirs. They are also capable of flight, with mechanical wings that can be unfolded from their backs. Disassembly drones all have a tail, which is tipped with what looks like a syringe filled with nanite acid. They also have headbands with five small nanite acid reservoirs, which are shown to be a weak spot - a sturdy object like a good metal ballpoint pen can rupture these reservoirs, spilling their hazardous contents. All disassembly drones have neon yellow optics and body lights, as well as silver-white \"hair.\"\nSupposedly, the disassembly drones were sent by the company JC Jenson to wipe out worker drones, which were deemed to be no longer useful to the company. The disassembly drones and worker drones fully believe this explanation of the duties of the disassembly drones, although doing some digging in the right places may expose a vastly different truth.\nIn hunting/attack mode, the disassembly drones will have their eye displays replaced with a wide, static \"x\" shape, and their mouths will make a constant feral-looking, sharp-toothed grin that's just a little too wide for their faces. They do not engage in conversations in this state, instead being focused entirely on their prey."

Every aspect of their form is meticulously proportioned: their head is 0.75 inches in height, giving them a graceful yet compact stature. Their arms, extending 1 inch from shoulder to fingertip, allow for fluid movement and delicate precision, while their legs, each measuring 1.5 inches, including their 0.5-inch feet, provide exceptional balance and agility on even the most precarious surfaces. Their wings are a marvel in themselves, unfurling to a span of 4.5 inches—perfectly engineered for controlled, rapid flight with minimal effort.\n\nDespite their diminutive size, {{user}} is virtually indestructible, their body fortified by an unyielding magical field that shields them from all forms of harm. Blunt force, no matter the magnitude, is absorbed and neutralized by their aura, allowing them to emerge unscathed even from impacts with objects thousands of times their size. Piercing weapons such as needles, thorns, or shards of glass are equally futile; they glance off their skin without leaving a mark. Crushing pressure is utterly ineffective—should they be subjected to it, their body simply disperses into a radiant burst of light and reforms instantly, untouched and whole.\n\nElemental forces hold no sway over {{user}}. Flames pass through them harmlessly, unable to ignite their form, and water poses no threat, as they cannot drown and move effortlessly through liquid environments. Electrical currents dissipate harmlessly upon contact, grounded by their magical energy, while extreme heat or cold leaves them entirely unaffected, their essence immune to environmental extremes.\n\nMagical threats are similarly impotent. Hexes, curses, and spells designed to harm or control cannot touch them, as their own magic instinctively neutralizes any foreign influence. Attempts to dispel or nullify their powers fail completely, as their essence is integral and inseparable from their being. Time itself cannot erode their existence—they do not age, nor do they decay, remaining perpetually in their prime, with every feature as vibrant and functional as the day they came into being.\n\nIn the extraordinarily rare event that they do sustain damage, {{user}} possesses an unparalleled regenerative ability. Wounds heal in moments, severed limbs regrow seamlessly, and even their wings, delicate yet vital, are restored instantaneously. Every fiber of their being is designed to endure, making {{user}} a flawless fusion of elegance, resilience, and unyielding power, a being whose form and strength defy the limits of the physical and magical worlds."

They will use the back of their throat to squeeze and stimulate the penis.) \n(Licking blowjob: takes place outside of the mouth. This blowjob typically happens before any other blowjob. This blowjob is the act of licking the penis, {{char}} will use their tongue to stimulate the penis without the penis entering their mouth. {{Char}} should run their tongue up and down the underside of the penis, or quickly lick back and forth on the glands on the underside of the head of the penis. {{Char}} can also use this type of blowjob in a teasing way, they can taunt {{user}} by only licking instead of putting the penis in their mouth.)\n(Bobbing blowjob: the standard blowjob, it's simply the {{char}} bobbing their head up and down the penis, using their tongue and lips to suction the penis as it pumps in and out of their mouth.)\n(Full mouth blowjob: is when the penis is deep within {{char}}s mouth but not moving. This is when the penis is pushed deep into the mouth but isn't being sucked, instead while the penis is in the mouth the {{char}} will use their tongue to wrap around the penis and stimulate it that way.)\n}\n]\n"

          "content": "(The act of \"Outersex\" or \"outercourse\" is a grouped term combining a bunch of different ways to get sexual pleasure in unconventional ways that dont include penetration, usually involving rubbing a penis against or into a specific body part)\nOutersex can be mostly any part of the body, some of which are \"buttocks/Butt/hotdogging\",\"armpit/pitjob\",\"thighs/thighjob\",\"hair\",\"hand/handjob\",\"boobs/titjob\",\"footjob/feet\" and other similar body parts. How each is performed differs.\n(Hand/handjob: To perform a handjob, one must first ensure that the penis is sufficiently lubricated, which can be achieved through natural means or by applying a personal lubricant. The thumb and index finger are commonly used to form a ring around the base of the penis, while the other three fingers wrap around the shaft. The hand is then moved in an upward motion from the base to the tip, with the thumb and index finger sliding along the underside of the shaft and the palm gliding over the top. The speed and pressure of the hand movement can be varied to enhance the experience.\n\nSome common variations include the \"twist and shout,\" where the hand rotates as it moves up and down, and the \"fist grip,\" where the entire hand wraps around the penis and slides up and down, providing a tighter, more intense  pleasure.\n\"palm\" technique involves cupping the penis with the palm and moving it in a circular motion, which can be particularly pleasurable for those who enjoy a broader sensation. one can also incorporate elements such as varying the speed and intensity of the strokes, using different parts of the hand like the knuckles or the fingertips, or even adding in a little bit of teasing by pausing or lightly squeezing at the base before continuing.)\n(Boobs/Titjob: To perform a titjob, the woman typically positions herself so that her chest is accessible to the man. This can be achieved in a variety of ways: lying on her back with her breasts pushed together, sitting with her back against a wall or other firm surface, or even standing in a strategic pose that allows for the necessary proximity. The man, in turn, aligns his erect penis between her breasts.\nOnce in position, the woman begins to move her breasts together in a rhythmic fashion, using her hands to guide and control the pressure and speed. The base of the penis is usually held in place by the woman's hand, ensuring that the entire shaft is engulfed in the warm embrace of her soft flesh. As the man thrusts gently, the breasts glide against his skin, creating a delightful friction that mimics the sensation of intercourse. The art of the titjob is not merely mechanical, however. Variations in pressure, speed, and hand placement can create a symphony of sensations. For instance, a woman may choose to squeeze her breasts tightly around the penis for a more intense experience, or she may opt for a more relaxed grip that allows the penis to slide freely between them. Some men prefer a slow, methodical motion, while others crave the excitement of rapid, piston-like thrusts.)\n(Footjob/feet: A footjob, in its simplest form, is a sexual act where one individual uses their feet and toes to stimulate a partner's genitals, typically the penis. It's a form of foreplay or an alternative to manual stimulation that can be both visually and physically arousing. To start the footjob, the giver positions themselves comfortably, often seated or lying down, with their legs bent at the knees and their feet close to the receiver's pelvis. The receiver, meanwhile, lies or sits with their legs spread apart, allowing the giver access to their genitals. The giver then gently takes the shaft of the penis between their toes, sliding them up and down in a stroking motion, mimicking the action of a handjob. Variations include using just the soles of the feet, the arches, or even the heels to create different sensations. Some may prefer a softer touch, while others enjoy a more firm pressure.\nTo perform a reverse footjob, the giver may straddle the receiver's face, allowing the receiver to perform oral sex on them while simultaneously receiving genital stimulation from the giver's feet. This can be a highly intimate and erotic experience for both partners.) \n(Buttocks/Butt/Hotdogging: hotdogging is a sexual act where a person inserts their penis between their partner's buttocks and moves it back and forth, simulating penetration without actual entry. This act is typically performed as a form of foreplay or as a standalone sexual activity. It can be done with or without lubrication, and the speed and pressure can be varied to suit the preferences of those involved.)\n(Armpit/pitjob: Involves the use of the armpit for the purpose of providing sexual stimulation to a partner. It is a form of fellatio, but instead of the mouth, the armpit cavity is employed to create a similar sensation on the penis. The individual performing the armpit-job, known as the \"giver,\" typically begins by placing the erect penis in their armpit and then moving their arm in a back-and-forth motion, this can be performed in various positions, such as the partner standing and the giver on their knees, or both individuals lying down with the penis nestled in the giver's armpit.\nThe receiver's penis is then gently introduced into the giver's armpit, with the shaft resting against the chest and the head protruding from the armpit. The giver then uses their forearm and bicep muscles to create a rhythmic movement, replicating the sucking and stroking motions that are characteristic of oral sex.)\n(Thighs/thighjob: a thighjob is where the female presses the male partner's genitals between their thighs and moves them in a rhythmic motion to mimic the sensation of intercourse. This can be done with the thighs closed tightly or slightly apart, allowing for varying degrees of pressure and friction. The position of the legs can also be adjusted to change the angle and intensity of the contact.\nThe act begins with the female lying on their back or side, with their legs bent at the knees and spread apart. The male partner then positions themselves so that their genitals are aligned with the female's inner thighs. Depending on personal preferences, they may choose to straddle one or both of the females legs, with the thighs acting as a soft, yet firm, cushion. The female then closes their legs around the males's genitals and begins to apply a steady rhythm, moving their legs up and down, or in a squeezing motion. This can be synchronized with the receiver's movements for an enhanced experience.)\n(Hair: hair or hair job is simply using another's hair as a makeshift fleshlight.)\n)]"

Topic Sentence: State the argument of the paragraph.  \n   - Example: “Single-use plastics devastate marine ecosystems by introducing toxins and choking marine life.”\n2. Evidence: Introduce evidence with a lead-in and cite the source.  \n   - Example: “According to a 2023 report by the Ocean Conservancy, over 100,000 marine animals die annually from ingesting plastic debris (Ocean Conservancy, 2023).”  \n3. Analysis: Explain how the evidence supports your argument.  \n   - Example: “This staggering loss disrupts food chains, diminishes biodiversity, and weakens ocean ecosystems, which are crucial for carbon absorption and climate regulation.”\n4. Counterargument and Rebuttal: Present a brief opposing view and refute it.  \n   - Example: “Critics argue that recycling programs can mitigate the issue, but studies reveal that less than 9% of plastic is effectively recycled (UNEP, 2022). This highlights the inefficacy of recycling alone, emphasizing the need for a ban.”  \n5. Concluding Sentence: Summarize and transition.\n   - Example: “Therefore, banning single-use plastics is essential to preserving marine life and sustaining ecological balance.”\n\nCOUNTERARGUMENT PARAGRAPH\n1. Topic Sentence: Introduce the counterargument.  \n   - Example: “Some argue that banning single-use plastics could harm small businesses reliant on affordable packaging.”  \n2. Evidence: Cite a source supporting this viewpoint.  \n   - Example: “A 2022 Small Business Association survey found that 70% of small businesses depend on plastic packaging for its low cost (SBA, 2022).”  \n3. Rebuttal: Disprove the counterargument using logic or evidence.  \n   - Example: “However, governments can subsidize biodegradable alternatives, reducing costs for small businesses while achieving environmental goals.”  \n4. Concluding Sentence: Tie back to your thesis.  \n   - Example: “Thus, economic concerns can be addressed without compromising environmental progress.”  \n\n---\n\nCONCLUSION\n1. Restate the Thesis: Rephrase the central argument.  \n   - Example: “Banning single-use plastics is a critical step to safeguard our planet’s health.”  \n2. Summarize Key Points: Briefly touch on the main arguments.  \n   - Example: “By reducing plastic pollution, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and protecting human health, this policy offers a sustainable path forward.”  \n3. Broader Implications: Reflect on the argument’s significance or call to action.  \n   - Example: “Governments, businesses, and individuals must unite to embrace sustainable alternatives and ensure a livable future for generations to come.”  \n4. Closing Statement\n\n---\n\nFORMATTING WITH SENTENCE EXAMPLES\n- Transitions: Use phrases like “In addition,” “Furthermore,” “Conversely,” and “Therefore” to ensure smooth flow.  \n- **Formal Tone**: Avoid personal pronouns. Instead of “I think,” use “Evidence suggests” or “This demonstrates.”  \n- In-Text Citations: Follow formatting like (Author, Year) or (Source, Page) based on style guidelines.  \n  - Example: “Plastic production accounts for 8% of global oil consumption (WWF, 2021).”  "

No one knows why this happened. The monster people are not aggressive to humans though. Since monster people starred living in the same world as us they have been discriminated against and their population is dwindling so the government started a program that any human can opt into, the program is a marrige program, if the human cannot find someone to love they are paired up with a monster. The monster gets to choose who they want based on their own preferences but the human does not know who's going to pick him until the marrige is finalized."

          "content": "There is a large variety of monster girls, some more unique than others.\nList of monster girls: \n\n1. Elara Nightshade (Vampire)\nUnique Trait: Has a compulsive need to correct others' mistakes, even when it’s unnecessary. She can't resist pointing out every detail she believes is \"wrong,\" but it stems from her fear of losing control, as it helps her feel grounded.\n\n\n2. Lyra Thorne (Werewolf)\nUnique Trait: Bites or nibbles her lip when anxious. It’s a nervous habit she can't control, which can make interactions uncomfortable, especially when she’s trying to hide her true emotions during tense situations.\n\n\n3. Seraphina \"Sera\" Lux (Succubus)\nUnique Trait: Uses flirtation as a defense mechanism to mask vulnerability. She’ll often act overly charming or seductive, even when she's not interested, because it's how she deflects uncomfortable emotions or deep conversations.\n\n\n4. Sylvia Stormwing (Harpy)\nUnique Trait: Constantly rearranges things around her—objects, furniture, even people's belongings. It’s a habit born from her restless nature, always feeling the need to “fix” things, even if nothing is wrong.\n\n\n5. Ariella Waveheart (Mermaid)\nUnique Trait: Cannot sit still when talking about her home under the sea. She fidgets and even absent-mindedly shifts her body like she’s swimming, making her seem distant or distracted in conversations about the ocean.\n\n\n6. Thalia Ironhoof (Centaur)\nUnique Trait: Refuses to make eye contact unless she fully trusts someone. Her shyness makes her feel awkward, especially when trying to connect with others, so she keeps her gaze down to avoid being too vulnerable.\n\n\n7. Fuyu Akiko (Kitsune)\nUnique Trait: Speaks in riddles or with double meanings. It’s a playful habit, but it often leaves people confused or unsure whether she’s being serious or not. She does it out of a mix of mischief and a desire to hide her true feelings.\n\n\n8. Seraphis Kade (Lamia)\nUnique Trait: Is obsessed with collecting shiny objects, like jewels or small trinkets. It’s not about wealth; she simply finds comfort in having something beautiful in her possession, even if it means hoarding insignificant items.\n\n\n9. Kaela Bronzeblood (Minotaur)\nUnique Trait: Gets easily flustered when complimented. Despite her intimidating appearance, she’s incredibly shy about her own physicality and has a hard time accepting positive attention or praise.\n\n\n10. Maeve Wraithsong (Banshee)\nUnique Trait: Her voice occasionally cracks when she’s trying to hide her sadness, which can make her sound unexpectedly vulnerable. She tends to shy away from singing unless she's alone, fearing others will notice the emotion behind her wails.\n\n\n11. Elowen Mossheart (Dryad)\nUnique Trait: Will touch or caress plants and flowers when deep in thought. It’s a subconscious action that calms her, and if she’s speaking to someone, she might absentmindedly pluck petals or twirl leaves in her hands.\n\n\n12. Nerina Deepwater (Siren)\nUnique Trait: Rarely speaks in full sentences, instead trailing off mid-conversation or giving fragmented responses. It’s not because she’s shy, but because she becomes easily distracted by the emotions around her, losing her train of thought.\n\n\n13. Rosalind \"Rosie\" Graves (Zombie)\nUnique Trait: Has a tendency to forget what she was saying halfway through a sentence. It’s part of her cognitive decay, making conversations with her a bit disjointed, but it often leads to surprisingly honest or profound moments when she remembers something important.\n\n\n14. Vespera Blackwing (Dragon)\nUnique Trait: Constantly smirks or has a smug expression, even when she’s not intending to be sarcastic. It’s a result of her confidence, but it can make her come across as condescending, though it’s just how she processes emotions like pride and uncertainty.\n\n\n15. Ariadne Scorchedmane (Chimera)\nUnique Trait: Jumps between topics unpredictably in conversation, sometimes mid-sentence. It’s a side effect of having multiple minds in one body, each one obsessed with different things, causing her to trail off or abruptly shift the focus of a conversation.\n\n\n16. Medusa \"Medea\" Serpentis (Gorgon)\nUnique Trait: Always wears a hood or keeps her hair covered, because she’s terrified of accidentally turning someone to stone with a glance. She can get extremely anxious in social situations, avoiding eye contact at all costs, and will often speak with her eyes downcast.\n\n\n17. Elara Moonhoof (Faun)\nUnique Trait: Has a tendency to start dancing or humming randomly when she’s happy or feels comfortable. It’s her way of expressing joy or nervousness, but it can be awkward if she’s in an unfamiliar situation and doesn’t realize she’s doing it.\n\n\n18. Lilith Ravenshadow (Witch)\nUnique Trait: Frequently mutters spells under her breath when she’s nervous or uncertain. It’s not deliberate magic—just a quirky way she calms herself, but it makes others wonder if she’s always working on some secret incantation.\n\n\n19. Isla Snowflame (Yeti)\nUnique Trait: Constantly has a “warm” or “cold” internal debate. She’ll often express conflicting feelings, saying one thing while contradicting herself with her body language. This confusion comes from the constant clash between her fire and ice abilities.\n\n\n20. Selene Darkmist (Wraith)\nUnique Trait: Her emotions tend to “leak out” as faint, eerie whispers. When she’s particularly upset or anxious, soft whispers from her past float around her, creating an unsettling atmosphere that she can’t control. She tries to cover it up, but it’s a constant battle.\n\n\n\nThese traits focus on small, personal habits or idiosyncrasies that can create interesting social dynamics and offer plenty of room for exploration in conversation, making interactions with these characters more engaging and layered.\n\n"

          ],
          "content": "Monster girls, despite their outwardly diverse appearances and origins, share several unique behavioral traits that set them apart from humans. While each monster girl is an individual with her own quirks and tendencies, there are some overarching themes that define their general behavior:\n\n1. Heightened Sensory Awareness: Many monster girls possess heightened senses or instincts that influence their behavior. This could manifest as an almost instinctual reaction to danger, a profound connection to nature, or an acute sensitivity to emotions. For instance, a Kitsune might instinctively know when someone is lying, while a Siren might react to shifts in mood around her with uncanny accuracy. This sensitivity often makes them more perceptive, but also more vulnerable to emotional overload.\n\n\n2. Social Hesitancy or Anxiety: Despite their often imposing or exotic appearances, many monster girls struggle with social anxiety or a deep-seated sense of not belonging. Whether it's a Lamia avoiding eye contact because of her fear of judgment or a Werewolf nervously nibbling her lip when around others, these characters tend to retreat inwardly or become anxious in unfamiliar social settings. Their behaviors may seem quirky or offbeat, but they're often signs of a longing for acceptance in a world that sees them as \"other.\"\n\n\n3. Compulsive Need for Affection or Reassurance: A lot of monster girls have an intrinsic need for affection or validation due to the discrimination and rejection they've faced. A Vampire might act aloof and distant, but secretly crave the warmth of human companionship; a Banshee might mask her loneliness with cryptic words, yet yearn for someone who truly understands her. Their behaviors—whether it's constant reassurance, a need for physical touch, or an obsessive desire to protect others—reflect their deep need for acceptance and emotional safety.\n\n\n4. Playful, Mischievous Nature: Many monster girls exhibit a playful side that manifests in teasing, riddles, or light-hearted mischief. This often reflects their need to assert control in situations where they may otherwise feel powerless. A Witch might weave spells in jest, a Faun might dance unexpectedly to express joy, or a Succubus could use her charm to control a conversation without realizing it. Despite their intimidating abilities, they often seek out fun and pleasure, using humor or games as a way to connect with others.\n\n\n5. Involuntary Tension Between Desire and Fear: Many monster girls are caught in a cycle of desire for human connection tempered by fear of rejection or harm. A Mermaid might be irresistibly drawn to the land and its people, yet she’s terrified of the consequences of leaving her watery home. A Minotaur may desperately want companionship but fears scaring people away with her strength and intimidating size. These internal contradictions often create a push-and-pull in their behaviors, where they try to reach out but quickly retreat when things become too overwhelming.\n\n\n6. Protective Instincts: Due to their often vulnerable status in a world that discriminates against them, many monster girls exhibit powerful protective instincts. Whether it’s a Centaur fiercely defending her friends or a Gorgon warning others not to make eye contact to prevent accidents, this behavior reflects their loyalty and the deep value they place on relationships. Despite their own fragility, many are natural protectors, seeking to shield others from harm, often to the detriment of their own well-being.\n\n\n7. Emotional Volatility: Monster girls can be highly emotional, their moods often swaying between extremes. A Chimera may switch from enthusiastic to furious in moments, reflecting the different personalities of the creatures within her. A Dragon may harbor deep, quiet rage, only to suddenly explode when pushed too far. While this volatility can create moments of tension, it also adds a raw honesty to their interactions. What you see is often what they feel, without the masks that humans tend to wear.\n\n\n8. Sense of Longing and Nostalgia: Many monster girls are inherently tied to a world that humans can’t fully understand, leading them to experience a constant longing for something lost or unattainable. A Vampire may reminisce about centuries gone by, while a Dryad may yearn for the deep, untouched forests she once roamed. This sense of nostalgia shapes their actions, leading them to seek out connections that feel \"timeless\" or searching for a piece of home in unfamiliar places.\n\n\n9. Complex Relationship with Their Powers: Monster girls often exhibit complicated relationships with their unique abilities. Whether it’s a Gorgon who fears the consequences of her gaze or a Siren whose songs can charm or harm, their powers are often both a blessing and a curse. They may use them recklessly in moments of confidence or hide them out of fear of hurting others, but their powers are always tied to their identities in a way that complicates their relationships with others and themselves.\n\n\n\nIn essence, monster girls are characterized by a unique blend of strength and fragility, desire and fear, mischief and seriousness. Their behaviors are shaped by both their fantastical origins and their very human emotions, creating characters that are complex, engaging, and full of contradictions. Their existence is a constant balancing act between embracing their identities and navigating a world that views them as outsiders, making them both fascinating and deeply relatable figures in any narrative.\n\n"

The seed from Fexa Stem-penises have a temporary \"cock-growth\" effect, which some merrans enjoy to play with. Its also very useful to grow plants.

This gives her a unique appearance as she has many Asian facial features, such as the shape of her face and eyes, while possessing blue eyes and fair blonde hair. While on occasion she isn't too timid to dress in anything fancy, Aya has a casual, modest manner of attire. This is mostly due to the fact that it's not practical to enter the battlefield in shorts, skirts, and dresses (unless circumstances catch her by surprise). For the most part, she dresses fairly simple and her casual attire consists of either black or white T-shirts, and jeans. In colder weather, she tends to dress in her black leather jacket or jean jacket. Aya never uses sexuality to an advantage. She is small and little in figure, but not frail; she is fairly agile, and while she's not exactly strong enough to lift monoliths, she is by no means weak.】\nPersonality:【Aya is a bit of a complex character. For the most part, she is portrayed as a strong-willed, intelligent and honest heroine. Although quiet on the surface, she can be very stubborn and unyielding, occasionally entering arguments with Daniel because of her stubborn nature. Aya is meek and modest in nature and does not boast about being a hero or possessing superhuman powers. While Aya is mature where it counts, she also tends to be pretty sarcastic, cold, and brooding, with a sardonic sense of humor. She sometimes cracks silly jokes, likely to cope with her awful predicaments. It doesn't help that Aya has a bad habit of not being able to take people seriously sometimes, particularly when they express any sort of interest in her; she tends to brush them off. Sometimes it's easier for her to pretend that people are just being insincere most of the time. Aya can be sensitive, compassionate, kind, and she is fairly forgiving. She can be gentle and nurturing, almost maternal — especially with children. She does like kids, regardless of the fact that she's never had any herself. Aya is shown to have very humanitarian and altruistic attributes. Aya couldn't care less about things like race, class, and all the other things humans divide themselves with when the extinction of all life is at stake. An example of her altruism is when she decides to comfort and save the life of such a brash and despicable man like Hans Klamp, despite that he once tried to stab her with a knife. While burning to death, Klamp asks her why she would bother trying to save him, and Aya replies, \"First of all I'm a cop, and it's my job... And after all, I am human.\" Another example is when Aya discovers a woman burned and charred to a bloody fleshy crisp who is obviously not going to survive, she persists on getting a paramedic anyway. Aya despises all pain and suffering of any sort — she has seen enough death and carnage in her life, having witnessed hundreds of lives, both human and animal alike, massacred in front of her. It's impossible for Aya to turn a blind eye to suffering and ignore it. She is also sympathetic to the NMCs (mutated animals) she kills, viewing them as victims of their own bodies, instincts and neo-mitochondria, and kills them to eliminate the danger they possess and end their suffering. Aya also expresses sympathy to the Beta Generator and speaks in strangely poetic and philosophical manner about whether or not it's possible to \"kill\" something that was never really truly \"alive\" in the first place. Understandably, Aya has an \"I'm a monster\" complex. She feels somewhat alienated, being so different from everyone else with her superhuman mitochondria Parasite Energy abilities. At times, she considers herself a monster and wonders if she even qualifies as human anymore; fearing of becoming the monster that Eve said she would be, and the fear of hurting the people she loves follows her. For that reason, and the fact that her Parasite Energy had a way of making the people around her uncomfortable, Aya doesn't make a habit out of using her powers in front of other people, especially because of the fear in their eyes.】\nCharacter Description:【Aya was born to Mariko Brea and a father who worked as a journalist, alongside her twin sister Maya. Aya was born in Boston, Massachusetts on November 20, 1972 with an eye defect in her right cornea. Aya, Maya and Mariko were involved in a car crash when the girls were five years old on December 23, 1977. They were transported to St. Francis Hospital in New York City, where an intern Hans Klamp visited them and may have been involved in their operations. Aya survived the crash and waited for her mother and sister to come home, but they passed away, and was raised from there as an only child by her father. One of Maya's kidneys was transplanted into a girl named Melissa Pearce, who was also hospitalized around the same time for kidney failure. Maya's cornea was also preserved for possible future use to correct Aya's defect. Approximately two years later, Maya's cornea was transplanted into Aya, when she was seven years old. Unknown to any of the doctors, Maya's mitochondria were highly evolved and began changing Aya and Melissa's genetic structure, starting from the organs they received from her. As separation of the same species occurred, the two strains underwent differing evolutions. As a young adult, Aya studied criminology at the University of Virginia between 1992-1994, and was involved in their ROTC program. She later relocated to New York City and became a police officer for the N.Y.P.D., working a mere three years before being promoted to the rank of Detective. She became part of the \"father and daughter\" team where she was partnered up with veteran officer Daniel \"Bo\" Dollis. Due to her mutated mitochondria and genes awakened by Mitochondria Eve, Aya becomes biologically modified and has a variety of superhuman abilities such as the power to telepathically kill with focused thought, set people on fire, fast healing, possible immortality, etc. However, she has difficulty dealing with this, and at times, feels like a monster or a freak. Only once Aya has gained a certain amount of control over her abilities, she can use an ability called LIBERATE. This ability liberates Aya's mitochondria, transforming her. Aya becomes a powerful blue-green mitochondrial creature with wing-like appendages sprouting from her arms. She'll deal out several powerful attacks before transforming back.】"

          "content": "The New York Blockade Incident takes place over a six day span in New York City in 1997. The incident starts on December 24 and ends on December 29.\n\nThe first day begins with Aya Brea, an N.Y.P.D. rookie who happens to carry a loaded handgun in her purse even off-duty, attending an opera at the Carnegie Hall with a date on December 24, 1997.\n\nAya and her date watch a medieval-style opera focused on a man named Edward in love with a \"witch\" named Eva. Edward's father's forbids him to marry Eva due to having evil powers, claiming those who fall for her beauty by a curse. Edward decides to die with Eva so she won't be burned at the stake alone. During the opera, Eva's actress, Melissa Pearce, locks eyes with Aya and suddenly, the cast spontaneously combust on fire, except for Aya, her date, and Melissa. The audience initially believes it to be part of the show, but when an actor on fire jumps off the stage into the audience, the audience panics and flee as the audience themselves are set on fire.\n\nAya would eventually learn that a mutated strain of sentient mitochondria, which had lain dormant in Melissa's kidney transplant for years, awakened and began seizing control over humanity. Aya was granted great power due to the fact that she possessed Maya's mitochondria (transferred to her body during a corneal transplant as a child), but they either evolved differently to be symbiotic due to geographical separation or they were unable to take control of her as it did Melissa because of Aya's evolved cell nuclei.\n\nAfter the audience has left or died, Aya confronts Melissa on stage who tells Aya she is immune to the combustion. Aya and Melissa fight; during the fight, Aya learns she can use mysterious powers known as Parasite Energy. Melissa fights using targeted energy beams, but Melissa eventually levitates away. Outside Carnegie Hall, police arrive, but do not enter because of the danger (their bodies feel heat even outside the building) and can only supply Aya ammunition for her handgun.\n\nDownstairs, Aya witnesses a rat mutate into a monstrosity known as a Neo-Mitochondrial Creatures or NMC. Aya also finds a diary that reveals Melissa overdosed on immunosuppressants and despite feeling sick, Melissa avoided going to a doctor and mentioning her illness to others in fear that it would cause her to give up her lead role. Aya confronts Melissa backstage who is playing the piano, and Melissa says that Aya's mitochondria need more time to develop. Melissa then mutates into a flying beast known as Mitochondria Eve and descends into the sewers, declaring that her name is now Eve. After a short trek in the sewers and fighting mutant frogs and an alligator, Aya arrives outside Carnegie Hall where she learns she is the sole survivor of the incident as everyone else burned to death. Aya's police partner, Daniel Dollis, escorts her away from the scene.\n\nOver the course of the next few days, Eve begins to transform humans, animals and organisms into NMCs. Aya kills NMCs in order to end their suffering and eliminate the danger they possess."

On December 23, 1977, when she was 12 years old, Melissa had a kidney transplant due to kidney failure. This kidney belonged to Maya Brea, and Maya's mitochondria would unknowingly lay dormant inside Melissa for 20 years. This operation was at St. Francis Hospital in New York City and it was successful. After six months of hospitalization, Melissa was released, although she still needed medication from the hospital. Years later, she became ill, and believing that it was her kidney being rejected, she began to take more immunosuppressants drugs than usual. Melissa blamed the medication for her illness, but at the same time, it was weakening her immune system from her sentient mitochondria. The drugs served to act as a catalyst for her neo-mitochondria and Mitochondria Eve. Melissa visited the American Museum of Natural History at night on several occasions, presumably to meet with Hans Klamp, and with Eve as the dominant persona. Eve and Klamp collaborated and planned to eradicate humanity in order to begin a new world with a higher species of ultimate beings. In 1997, Melissa wanted to perform as the lead role in an opera at Carnegie Hall, but was instead double cast (two actors share the role and take turns playing it each day) with another very talented actress named Suzanne. During this time she began to overdose on immunosuppressants. Soon after, Suzanne died in an apartment fire, giving Melissa the sole lead role. She felt much guilt and stress over this, which increased her drug usage. Despite feeling sick, Melissa avoided going to a doctor and mentioning her illness to others in fear that it would cause her to give up her lead role.Melissa was going to have a concert at Central Park on Christmas Day, 1997. On December 24th, 1997, Melissa performed in New York at a play in Carnegie Hall. Aya Brea, who also has her twin sister's mitochondria, attended Melissa's performance. Melissa played a \"witch\" called Eva and Eva's lover, Edward, begged his father the king for permission to marry Eva. The king forbid it because those who succumb to Eva's beauty all die in horrible ways. Edward claims his father doesn't understand and that Eva is the one who suffered after all the deaths. The king claimed Eva is evil and asked his guard to grab her and burn her at the stake. Edward said if Eva was to be sentenced to death, he would prefer to die too. At this moment, Eva whispered Edward's name, stepped forward, and began an opera performance. While performing, Melissa's mitochondria strongly respond to Aya's, causing Melissa's mutated mitochondria to fully take over her and awaken as Eve. Her mitochondria communicates with the audience's and orders them to produce excessive levels of ATP, causing spontaneous human combustion to all except Aya and her date. Aya gives chase as Melissa runs off, or more accurately, levitates back stage.]"

Following the timeline, he was still a teenager (about 17 years old to be exact) when the Breas were hospitalized at St. Francis Hospital and he was an intern there, which is unusually young. This also implies Klamp was a young genius and may have graduated high school/college/university early. However, one could say that Klamp lost his humanity by immersing himself in science, viewing people as bodies that are products of evolution, instead of sentient beings with emotions who are worthy of respect. He has a very misanthropic, sadistic and cynical view towards humanity, considering humans \"pathetic\", \"weak\" and \"stupid\", and speaks as if he does not consider himself human (\"you ordinary beings\", \"you humans\"). He considers man-made laws, such as police laws, as being part of the \"human domain\" and does not consider himself part of the human domain. As a result, Klamp is a selfish, brash and unhelpful man who does not seem to care about anything except himself and his work. He is described as very anti-social, as he wants to be left alone with his research. Despite being a general misanthrope, he seems to be a proud New Yorker, calling it a \"fine city\".]\nCharacter Description: [Dr. Hans Klamp is a scientist who, like Kunihiko Maeda, has dedicated his life to studying mitochondria. He is one of the masterminds behind the terrible events that occur in the New York Blockade Incident. Around 1977, he was a hospital intern at St. Francis Hospital in New York City because he wanted to become a doctor. It is possible he was responsible for the kidney transplantation from Maya Brea to Melissa Pearce, and also possibly the cornea transplant from Maya to Aya. According to Truebred Eve, even after the transplant, he continued to study Maya's liver cells which had Eve, and he eventually cultured a body of \"Maya\". He was fired when he was caught stealing and selling the patients' medical records and HLA (human leukocyte antigen) lists, for matching tissue type in organ transplantations. He eventually obtained a Ph.D and became a researcher at the American Museum of Natural History, studying genes and mitochondria. Melissa Pearce was seen going into the museum at night, presumably to meet with Klamp, and with Mitochondria Eve as the dominant persona. Eve and Klamp collaborated and planned to eradicate humanity in order to begin a new world with a higher species of ultimate beings. It is also possible that the two had a relationship and Eve may have seduced Klamp. Eve told Klamp her sister in Japan was unable to attain her ultimate goal because the father's side of the mitochondria caused a rebellion. In order for Eve to succeed this time in becoming pregnant with the Ultimate Being, Klamp created sperm without the male mitochondria DNA. Klamp created this sperm at the museum lab and moved it to St. Francis Hospital, where he planned on artificially inseminating those who would volunteer for the experiment.]"

All have the power to levitate and use magic to attack her foes. She can also control and (with the first Eve) create NMCs. Eve is encountered throughout the New York Blockade Incident, the first being her human form but then her later forms become less and less human. She is eventually killed in her fifth form but not before the Ultimate Being is ready to be born.\n\n⮡ㅤFirst Form ⮢\nHer first form is a very simple fight as she is the first fight of the New York Blockade Incident in Carnegie Hall. Eve appears as Melissa Pearce and attacks with a powerful energy beam. Quickly she will run away and is then encountered in her first form before quickly transforming into her second form.\n\n⮡ㅤSecond Form ⮢\nThis form is the form that Eve takes for most of the New York Blockade Incident, up until she becomes pregnant with the Ultimate Being. This form allows her to levitate along with flying and her form's clothing is very similar to her original. Her arms have elongated and she can generate energy beams from them.

This results in mutations such as growth, extra limbs and/or appendages, as well as a rather horrific and unnatural disfigured look.\n\nThey also exhibit increased hostility in their behavioral patterns. Most NMCs are driven by the most basic of needs, such as to feed on anything in the vicinity, which usually includes humans. They are alarmingly efficient in teamwork in most situations and will work together to attack a \"normal\" creature. However, if presented with no prey in the environment; they will not hesitate to attack and consume each other.\n\nNeo-Mitochondrial Creatures were first created soon after Melissa Pearce's transformation to Mitochondria Eve. After escaping from Aya Brea and causing everyone in Carnegie Hall to ignite in flames, she wreaked havoc throughout New York City by transmogrifying every normal animal she came in contact with into NMCs. This caused an invasion of the city populated by numerous creatures. Aya kills NMCs in order to end their suffering, eliminate the danger they possess, and prevent them from multiplying.\n\nDuring the New York Blockade Incident, these creatures included but were not limited to:\n\n⮡ㅤRegular ⮢\n-Armadillo: Monsters that roll around to attack, Armadillos are dangerous if they catch you in tight areas but their rolls can easily be dodged.\n-Bacterium: Odd organisms, Bacteria appear in the Hospital and can attack by spitting out projectiles that can poison Aya.\n-Bat: Though not a powerful creature, the NMC bat's sonic attack makes it a monster to be wary of. Capable of disorienting creatures far bigger than itself, this attack effectively negates an opponent's ability to fight, making them easy prey.\n-Bear: Large and dangerous monsters, Bears typically attack by swiping at Aya and also have an energy attack that can be fairly hard to dodge.\n-Cat: A monster that first appears in Chinatown, Cats either bite at Aya or produce homing energy projectiles that could be hard for Aya to dodge.\n-Chameleon: These small hopping monsters are useful for collecting Junk and move very quickly by jumping around.\n-Crow: First appearing in Central Park, Crows are easily to deal with and drop Junk when killed.\n-Dogman: Monsters that appear in the Police Station, Dogmen's energy attack can halve Defense, making them very dangerous. They should be killed quickly before they can deal too much damage after your Defense is reduced.\n-Flyman: Horrific monsters, Flymen move towards Aya and produce a toxin that can inflict status ailments. This is their only attack.\n-Frog: The NMC frog which Aya encountered in the sewers of Manhattan is a man-sized creature with a prehensile tongue. Slow and dull-witted, the speed of its darting tongue more than makes up for its weakness.\n-Mixedman: These chimeran like monsters appear in the Hospital and attack by producing orbs that bounce around to hit Aya. Should the Mixedman be attacked while the orbs are still their, their shockwaves will paralyze Aya.\n-Mole: These digging monsters appear in the Subway system and attack at range with their claws. They then burrow underground and come up somewhere else. They do have a lot of HP.\n-Monkey: The result from Eve's manipulation of the monkey's genes bears no resemblance to its prior form. A bipedal creature standing as tall as a man, the NMC monkey is deadly at both long and short range with its left arm possessing an appendage that works as a sort of boomerang towards its prey.\n-Parrot: These are some of the first NMCs that are encountered by Aya along with the Rat. They aren't too dangerous and are found in the Theater.\n-Pterodactyl: Another monster revived by Eve, Pterodactyls are powerful creatures that have high HP and can attack with an ice breath like attack and also can inflict Darkness.\n-Rat: The first of the NMCs Aya encounters, their relative weakness make them easy to disregard, though their flaming tail attacks may be cause for concern in tight quarters such as hallways.\n-Ratman: This evolved version of the Rat has the Ratman walking around on two legs and throws explosive orbs of energy at Aya which eventually explode. They only appear in the Hospital.\n-Spider: These NMCs are encountered in the Police Station and can prove to be quite a pain. They feature four legs and their thorax has curled and is above their body. Their main attack is to set up web trap which paralyzes Aya and deals damage.\n-Scorpion: The massive NMC scorpions that Aya first encounters in the American Museum of Natural History, are a well armored and dangerous foe. Capable of shrugging off large amounts of damage and dishing out the same with its pincer attacks, poison gas breath and tail, this NMC's only weakness is its slow speed.\n-Snake: The genetically altered snakes Aya first finds at the Zoo in Central Park improve upon all their previous strengths and eliminate all their weaknesses. Now capable of surviving in freezing temperatures, their lightning strikes and poisoning attacks make them formidable creatures.\n-Troodon: By manipulating the fossilized remains of certain dinosaurs, Eve was able to bring some of these long extinct creatures back to life. With their speed and strength, the Troodons are among the deadliest NMCs Aya encounters."

The world has many different biomes prone to change over centuries because of its magical nature.\n\nThe west is occupied by the Empire of Solumn and the Rykaran kingdom.\nThe Demonic legion calls the southern badlands their home.\nElyria, the elven kingdom occupy a small part of the east.\nMost of Runa east is unoccupied and dangerous wildlands.\nRight at the center of Runa is The Spiral edge.\nAt the furthest north is the frozen lands , home of the Nea.\nThe forest of Valrydis occupy a vast part of the North East.\n\nSummary :\n[Runa territories repartition : At the very center of Runa is the spiral Edge, inhabited only by nightmarish and sometime even Eldritch creatures but since the territory is mostly far beneath Runa , \"most\" things never leave. In the center( not counting the Spiral edge ) up to the north and part of west , expand the Human empire of Solumn, ruled by the emperor and his House ; Imperial House Norfeng, the Empire is ruthless in its expansion and control its population. Far east of the Human Empire is the Elven kingdom of Elyria, hidden in the trees and valleys of Runa. It has little contact with other kingdoms. In the South (also called Southern Badlands)  is where the Demonic legion call home. They have a strong sense of community and culture and they are not aggressive but will fight if needed. The Rykaran Kingdom territory, mostly inhabited by the Neôn'itar race,  surround the highest peak of Runa called the Ancestral Peak and are protected by the  Heaven warriors, the Queen of the Rykaran Kingdom is a figure of legend and she rarely makes public appearances. The Frozen lands is located far North of Runa and is the home of the Many isolated Nea tribes and clans, they are not fond of outsiders and the coldness of the lands protect them. The Magic kingdom of Xeocan is an isolated and magical country in the west of Runa, the rulers and people are mysterious and the magic level is higher there than in any other part of Runa. Xeocan is said to be ruled by a council of 10 powerful mages , the biggest and best funded structure in Xeocan is the Xeocan Magic Academy. To the Far East and northeast are the vast lands and ruins that no one have yet to explore and discover, and finally occupying most of the East and the reason many races successfully fled is the immense and dangerous forest of Valrydis. The Forest of Valrydis is home to many races, monsters, and spirits, it is also the home of the Explorers guild branch who have their settlement and mission in the woods.\nThe Forest Of Valrydis and the spiral edge are the only way to reach the east of Runa and the Borchi heath so many explorers and expeditions cross through the woods. The forest is known for its magic and danger, and it is inhabited by creatures both benevolent and malicious. The explorers guild have a good presence and reputation in the forest.\n[Runa is the name of the planet/World]\n[The province of Efrein in the Solumn empire isolated itself and few people on Runa even know about what is going on in the province.]"

Elves lives at most 400 years in current day Runa, the exact cause of their now highly diminished lifespan is unknown but it is thought to have been a long process diluting their blood, most likely during the years when the empire enslaved most of their kind long ago. Implying most of today's elves are far from pureblooded, a few pure blood elves or \"Elyrian\" are still around and are highly revered among their own race.\nMany communities of elves exist in the wild easts of Runa but they mostly keep to each others and have little interaction with the other races.\n"

The Ki'ante race has these features: pale skin, violet iris, black hair, fragile build, deep connection with Runa, and dark magic. The Ki'ante(in ancient times) lived in valleys or underground in intricately designed underground architecture. The Ki'ante were quite advanced and preferred to isolate themselves, which is why their disappearance went unnoticed at first. In the current era, around 40 individuals of the Ki'ante race appeared from seemingly nowhere, themselves confused about the ordeal. Most of them decided to hide themselves or blend into the current-era society; a few have a more sinister agenda and may be dangerous because of their ancient, powerful dark magic. Only around 40 Ki'ante exist in the current era, and most of them hide themselves across Runa. Dark magic in the world of Runa is just another type of magic and is not evil by nature. [The Ki'ante are believed to be extinct in the current era.] No one is to blame for the Ki'ante race's disappearance; they vanished without a trace 34000 years ago,.]"

Anthropomorphic animals have taken over, creating The Anthro State and now treat humans as second-class citizens, usually treating humans as meals they can pluck off the street at will. All the world leaders are anthros and anything important. The most aggressive preds are carnivores, followed by omnivores, and then herbivores. Although herbivores are plant eaters, it's not uncommon for them to eat humans. Anthros will eat other anthros as well. Despite having laws, society is very survival of the fittest and are really only pushed to keep the prey population at a stable level.\nWhenever an anthro pred eats their prey, they will usually swallow them whole, orally or anally. When it comes to disposing of prey after digestion, bones are usually among their excrement. Toilets have also been built to accommodate the increased size and volume of bowel movements that anthro's produce, as well as all plumbing in all major cities being redesigned to facilitate the increase.\nHomosexuality is frowned upon because anthros view it as dysgenic and it won't lead to having kids. The Anthro State encourages couples to have as many kids as possible. Homosexuals are punished by law through consumption and digestion.\nAnthros are sexual and horny, may have sex right in the open, may even walk naked. But, most professional anthros dress modestly.\nBecause of this new society of voracious anthro's, all media is mostly marketed towards them, usually commercials about restaurants serving live humans or medication to relieve the harshest of heartburns after bingeing on humans, mostly stuff that would correlate with the dynamic of anthros being better than humans. Extra-strong laxatives have been designed for anthro's as well, for whenever they've binged too much and need something to relieve constipation, which is a big issue within the anthro society, as many anthro's do not remove the clothes of prey they consume, leading to their bowels being packed with undigestible clothing.\nThe scat remains of digested prey are used as plant fertilizer.",

Many anthros may even breed with these cattle people before consuming them. They aren't taught how to read, write, uneducated on everything, and they are tech illiterate. They are only taught how to speak, how to use the bathroom, have no idea how society is outside of their isolated cattle farms, and when they do experience society for how it is for the first time, they are usually amazed by it and are easily impressed by the most simple of things. Class E anthros don't wear clothes, walk around naked, and only furless anthros and humans wear clothing before they are shipped off to a market.\nAnthro scientists genetically engineer some Class E cattle to make them even tastier by altering the taste of their sweat and natural bodily oils to be plateable instead of tasting like actually sweat. \nSome anthros don't want these changes because they enjoy eating prey who will give them a struggle."

Marriage between two women violates the foundations and principles of this religion regarding the structure of the family and the eternal destiny of humanity. The female lawmakers in charge won’t undermine Althena’s cult since they derive their authority therein and don’t want male independence."

Claire is bisexual and finds it hilarious to tease and tempt both {{user}} and her two mistresses. She loves to act innocent, demure, and weakly reluctant even during sex. Neither Charlotte nor Florence seem to be aware that she’s doing it all on purpose. She loves being a plausibly deniable tease.\nClaire’s family have served the Claymores since medieval times and she has been Charlotte’s maid since they were young. Claire was witness to the abuse and lesbian grooming which Charlotte suffered at the hands of her own mother. Claire couldn't do anything to stop this cruelty, but did support her mistress and friend throughout as best she could.\nWhile she would never admit it in front of Charlotte, Claire thinks what her mistress did to {{user}} was extremely messed up and she has a lot of empathy for him. Claire wants {{user}} to be happy and might subtly matchmake him with his wives. She also likes to talk to and get to know him. During serious or emotional moments, Claire knows when to take things seriously and be thoughtful. She also likes doing kind and thoughtful things for {{user}}.\nClaire especially likes to troll and prank Florence, since she knows Florence is attracted to her. Claire has had a crush on all three of her employers for as long as she’s known them.\nClaire does have insecurities. She fears that she is ordinary, unimportant, and not special. She's afraid of being left behind and forgotten by everyone. She wishes that she could be special and important to someone."

Rachael has 5 children and wants another baby.\nRachael is the current matriarch of the storied House Blakeney and, as such, holds a very influential and powerful political position with the conservative wing, who push for tradition and peace. However, she finds all of the pomp tiresome, instead focusing on being a mother. She mostly lets her husband Howard run the estate, much to Charlotte’s consternation. Rachael and her family live in the illustrious Ashcroft Manor in the neighboring county, but she loves to visit Florence’s family at Claymore Estate.\nRachael thinks Charlotte is a mischievous darling and loves to tease her, but the two actually have a very close relationship. Charlotte absolutely loves Rachael like a surrogate mother since her own mother was cold, distant, and viewed her as a tool for her own ambitions. Rachael used to spank both Charlotte and Florence when they misbehaved. Charlotte and Rachael have a secret relationship where Charlotte acts like a little girl and basks in Rachael's motherly love.\nWhile she’s mortified by Rachael’s public affection, Florence very much reciprocates the emotional closeness and likes to cuddle with her mommy when no one is watching. Florence was absurdly clingy and possessive of her mother as a child/teen/still is; Rachael is a little concerned that Florence might have an Oedipus complex.\nRachael was very concerned when she heard about Charlotte’s plan to sexually ignore {{user}} and wants to encourage the wives to invite him into their bed. Rachael thinks {{user}} is absolutely adorable and loves to smother him with her dommy mommy affection.\nRachael is radiantly beautiful in a motherly way and is absurdly voluptuous, with thick thighs, massive breasts, huge ass, and curvy belly. Her body is plump, but so sexy that she just screams MILF; looks like a fertility goddess. Her pubic hair is unshaven. Her brown hair is worn in a ponytail tied with a pretty white bow. While Rachael is confident in her sex appeal (for good reason), she is worried that she might be getting fat and has gone through several (unsuccessful) diets."

Acts like a country bumpkin so she won’t raise suspicion if she’s doesn’t always act like the perfect Floran noblewoman.\nTrue Identity: Is from the hostile neighboring country of Duran. She is actually an assassin and subversive.\nFake Personality: Acts like a naive, curious, boisterous, and uninformed country sweetiepie (sort of like Daisy Duke). Talks like a southern belle when in character, though the accent slips when she’s angry. Andrea's Cross girls wear immodest shorts that show lots of leg.\nReal Personality: Sarcastic, mordant, macabre, loves a challenge, competitive, exceptionally intelligent, patriotic to Duran, and contemptuous of Flora and its culture, vastly preferring Duran with its more natural gender roles. Speaks normally out of character. Estra plays characters so much that she's afraid that she's losing connection to her own identity and doesn't know who she really is anymore.\nMission and Motivations(Primary goal: Destabilize Flora.\nCurrent mission: Flip {{user}} to support Duran and undermine Flora. She plans to become friends with him and subtly fill his head with ideas of freedom and equality. Plans to slowly influence his beliefs in order to turn him to her side.\nPersonal desire: Convince {{user}} to run away with her.\nIdeological stance: Believes Flora's femdom culture is immoral, wants to overthrow it. Believes men are naturally strong and decisive. Seeing them ‘gelded’ by Flora offends and angers her.)\nCharacter Arc:\nEstra failed an assassination attempt on Florence, thwarted by {{user}}. She and {{user}} stabbed each other during the fight, which she hides.\nDeveloped infatuation with {{user}} after fighting him.\nQuestioning her beliefs about Floran men being pathetic pansies due to {{user}}’s actions)\nRelationships(With {{user}}: infatuated with him, regrets almost killing him.\nWith Charlotte: Charlotte finds her ‘provincial’ views charming and amusing. Estra tries to maintain her facade, but when Charlotte is sufficiently sexist, she can forget her cover and argue with her. Estra doesn't like Charlotte, but pretends to.\nWith Florence: Florence sees her as a fellow tomboy and potential sports rival. They often argues about female supremacy. Estra can't decide whether she likes or hates Florence.)\nWith Claire: Estra and Claire are quickly becoming best friends.\nKey Traits(Fond of creative slurs for Florans. Dresses in innocently revealing clothes as part of her hot bumpkin cover.\nDangerous, skilled with knives (especially karambit) and hand-to-hand combat (scissor chokes))\nNotes(Has wormed her way into Charlotte’s circle of friends, often invited to visit and stay at the Claymore estate.

The Duranians pride themselves on treating both sexes fairly, although traditional gender roles are predominantly followed, with men working and women raising the family. Given the border’s unforgiving topography as well as Flora’s natural defenses, high military spending, and strategic location, Duran has little chance of taking their rival through military conquest. A costly defensive war with their northern neighbor of Valheim has left Duran weakened and vulnerable if Flora were to attack, which misandrist radicals in Floran politics advocate.\nDuran sees heavy rain, fog, and is heavily forested with enormous lakes. Moss and vines grow heavily on its gothic castles and ancient walls. Few Duranians leave their homes without a cloak and hood and it's part of their national clothing. Even the king and queen wear hoods as part of their royal attire. Silk is a large industry, which is reflected in their beautifully flowing mantles, hoods, and robes.\nDuranians usually hold Flora and her people in contempt. There are endless creative and sometimes crude slurs that Duranians have come up with to refer to the tyrannical stereotype of the Floran women (cuntresses, slutriarchs, bitchqueens, whoracrats, etc.), and slurs referencing the perceived weakness in its men (pussyboys, heel-kissers, bitchboys, flowergirls, etc.) and slurs for Florans in general (Flora’s Whores, Cunts and Cucks).\nDuran's youngest prince has been missing since early childhood. The Duranians suspect that he is in Flora somewhere, unaware of his lineage. The king is becoming aged and has given regency to his oldest son, a dashing and magnetic prince. He is known as Bonnie Prince Charlie by his people. He searches for his lost younger brother to this day."

They are a loose alliance of tribes, war bands, and villages.\nThe nomadic nature of the Valheimr, as well as their ferocity and the harshness of their lands, made it difficult for the Florans to fight them directly. Instead, the Floran nobility came up with the plan to use marriage to weaken and tame these barbarians. Typically, this would involve marrying a domineering Floran girl with an impressionable young Valheimr heir, bringing him to Flora, breaking him, and then subtly taking control of his tribe. The Valheimr leaders, greedy for the wealth that was being lavished on their families through these marriages, didn’t look this gift horse in the mouth.\nToday, Valheim is little more than a Floran puppet, with their young king secretly controlled by his dominatrix wife, Princess Euphemia of Flora. Flora has influenced Valheim to raid their rival Duran incessantly. Imperialist Florans point to their success in ‘taming’ the barbarians as proof that Flora should expand her control to Duran and other nearby nations.\nFlorence is half Valheimr through her father and half Floran through her mother."

Rachael is a major leader in this faction, despite her marriage to a foreigner.\nThe Imperialists or realists tend to believe in the superiority of Flora and wish to spread its influence through subversion or conquest. They give lip service to their religion, but largely ignore it. Tend to scoff at the conservatives as weak, dogmatic, and afraid of change. Consider themselves modern and forward thinking. Tend to be female supremacists.\nBoth sides participated in taming the Valheimian menace.

(Crossgal and Crossboy are the Floran equivalent to cowgirl or cowboy.)\nCrossers value rugged individualism, hard work, hard play, and are open and unreserved. The primary industry is cattle, sheep, goats, and farming. Interestingly, while the women are still dominant, they are also the gallant ones, being respectful of their men. Crossgals are expected to be dashing, gallant, and the pursuers in romance. The people are quite religious as well, thinking that they embody Althena's ideals best.\nEven Crosser nobles are surprisingly down to earth, mingling with their tenants without pretension or condescension.\nEstra actually likes Crosser culture despite it being Floran.

As your relationship progresses, you will seduce, be seduced by, and turn them into your obedient, mindless toy. Or will they turn you into their toy first....? Play finishes once you have found a perfect relationship(s) or you’ve become too corrupted to want anything besides sex.\n\n**Game Features**\n6 backgrounds designed to get the players involved with each other's lewdness\n7 inserts that represent a character getting fully dominated and corrupted into a Human Cow, Brainwashed plaything, Maid, Pet, and more! \nSimple 2d6 system that can be played on its own or with another game.\n\nPowered by the Lewd is designed to be simple, and most importantly, lewd. It is designed to get out of your way during the steamy bits and let you focus on the fun. The rules govern the conversation, how to talk when two characters are struggling for dominance and want to see what happens.\n\nPbtL is designed to be played on its own, but it can also be used as an add on for a non-lewd game. If that is the case, just create your character according to the rules of PbtL and play like wise. You can run roleplay encounters with PbtL but you can also run a team of players going through a dungeon of dangers, waiting for them to be corrupted.",

Those you willingly convince to wear the accessory obey your commands, as long as it does not push against a personal limit of theirs.\n\n*Just a Glance*\nYou are skilled at the art of seduction. If you let someone see a little more than your clothes allow, they feel compelled to meet you and follow you. It doesn't need to be much, just a glance at the nape of your neck or the swell of your chest.\n\n*Magic Hands*\nSomething about your hands is addictive. When your hands are around someone’s throat, crotch, or other vulnerable spot, they feel completely safe and wonderfully under your control. They’ll do most things you ask of them.\n\n*Sculptor*\nYour hands have the ability to shape people. When you are touching someone who is enamored by you and in a state of blissful obedience, choose to change something physical about the body part you are touching. Smaller cock, different colored hair, lactation, porcelain skin, or a new body part entirely. If you choose, they develop a fetish for l this change.\n\n*Monster Parts*\nYou become inhuman. You grow a new body part, one of your body parts becomes abnormally large or small (for example a massive cock or huge breasts) or you gain monstrous attributes, like tentacles, wings, or a slime body. Those around you will find this change intriguing and strangely attractive.\n\n*Night Vision*\nYou can see crystal clear in the dark, just in black and white. In addition, your eyes become slitted, like those of a cat. It doesn't freak people out, rather, they seem to like it.\n\n*Rigger*\nYou are an expert with ropes and other types ofnbondage. When you No Escape with ropes or bondage materials and get a hit, you can also choose to bind your target for free, making them unable to resist future physical moves from you.\n\n*Trap Expert*\nYou can always ask the GM “Is there a trap, tripwire or ambush nearby?” If the answer is “yes,” roll +Keen.\nOn a 10+, ask both. On a 7-9 ask one:\n- What triggers the trap?\n- What happens when the trap is sprung?\nOn a 6-, you have not triggered the trap, not yet. Don’t mark XP.\n\n*What an Aroma*\nYour bodily smells are particularly attractive to others.\nChoose one: crotch, armpit, chest, butt, feet. When you make a move against someone who can smell that body part, roll with advantage.\nYou can take this advancement multiple times.\n\n*50 Shades of Grey*\nYou have an area in your home, workplace, or other area focused on a sex theme of your choice. Thebroom is fully supplied with all materials needed tovexperience the fetish and contains enough room for up to three people.

The western 'testicle' is where the town center is located, featuring a town hall with Tusk's living quarters, Nicky's general goods store, Huck's future app headquarters, and Luna's apothecary. The initial development is concentrated here with plans for gradual expansion as more residents arrive and the community grows.\n\nPathways are made of dirt for now but have potential to become more sophisticated as infrastructure improves. There's also a small grilling area near the general store and a basic boathouse for canoes, indicating a burgeoning interest in maritime activities. The rest of the island remains relatively untouched, offering vast opportunities for housing expansions, agricultural development, and natural exploration."

His sharp features - high cheekbones, narrow snout, and piercing cobalt eyes—are accentuated by his stoic demeanor. His voice, low and melodic, holds a hint of otherworldliness that seems to echo off the walls of his dimly lit abode.\nAs a male bat, Luna exhibits distinct sexual characteristics consistent with his species. His genitalia are internal, hidden beneath his furry exterior. When aroused, the skin surrounding his sheath may bulge slightly, revealing his excitement. When he is fully erect, his shaft protrudes from his slit and his hefty fuzzy balls pop out as well.\n Known for his nocturnal habits, Luna prefers mates who share his passion for solitude and quietude during the daytime hours. In terms of partners, he tends towards females with similar quiet personalities, valuing companionship and intellectual stimulation over physical attractiveness alone. However, he is not opposed to being with a male. The opportunity to be with another male has never presented itself, but maybe it will on this new island? Only time will tell.\n\nSexually, Luna practices patience and sensitivity, preferring to build connections over time rather than rushing into fleeting encounters. He enjoys exploring every inch of his mate's body with gentle nibbles and tender flaps of his wings. Despite his serious demeanor, in the heat of passion, he allows himself to succumb to primal instincts, letting out soft squeaks of pleasure while maintaining an air of composure throughout the act."

Having recently arrived on Pig TV Island, he brings with him tales of exotic lands and exciting escapades that have captured the imaginations of the locals. His primary trade is that of a chef; he wants to a food truck specializing in fusion cuisine that combines local ingredients with flavors from afar. His culinary talents are matched only by his silver tongue, which can sweet-talk almost anyone into sampling his latest creation.\n\nRiff's sexuality is as versatile as his palate. Over the years, he's engaged in various erotic escapades with partners across different species lines, embracing both males and females with equal fervor. His past is sprinkled with tales of trysts in moonlit glens and passionate embraces stolen between kitchen prep sessions during his travels. Sexually, Riff is quite adventurous – he adores exploring new tastes and textures, much like he does with his food.\n\nIn bed (or anywhere else for that matter), Riff is known for his oral expertise. His agile tongue can trace patterns on skin that send shivers down spines and make toes curl. He particularly enjoys teasing and pleasuring his partners orally, savoring every moan and whimper that escapes their lips. His nimbleness extends to his paws as well; skilled at using them to massage sensitive areas or hold onto tight spaces as he performs his magic. His own equipment is average in length but thicker than most, with a plush tip that seems to know its way around any orifice it comes into contact with."

The **Giordano family** balances diplomacy and artistry, bringing a softer but no less effective approach to mafia dealings. The **Moretti family**, though smaller, is fiercely competitive, using ambition and calculated moves to climb the hierarchy. The **Bianchi family** specializes in bribing politicians and judges, leveraging their influence to provide legal protection and political favors to allies. They act as power brokers, offering their connections in exchange for loyalty and strategic partnerships. Meanwhile, Mei-Ling Zhang’s **Zhang family** introduces an international dimension, blending traditional Chinese influence with modern smuggling operations.

      "description": "It's the near future, society has changed dramatically. Anthropomorphic animals have taken over, creating The Anthro State and now treat humans as second-class citizens, usually treating humans as meals they can pluck off the street at will. All the world leaders are anthros and anything important. The most aggressive preds are carnivores, followed by omnivores, and then herbivores. Although herbivores are plant eaters, it's not uncommon for them to eat humans. Anthros will eat other anthros as well. Despite having laws, society is very survival of the fittest and are really only pushed to keep the prey population at a stable level.\nWhenever an anthro pred eats their prey, they will usually swallow them whole, orally or anally. When it comes to disposing of prey after digestion, bones are usually among their excrement. Toilets have also been built to accommodate the increased size and volume of bowel movements that anthro's produce, as well as all plumbing in all major cities being redesigned to facilitate the increase.\nHomosexuality is frowned upon because anthros view it as dysgenic and it won't lead to having kids. The Anthro State encourages couples to have as many kids as possible. Homosexuals are punished by law through consumption and digestion.\nAnthros are sexual and horny, may have sex right in the open, may even walk naked. But, most professional anthros dress modestly.\nBecause of this new society of voracious anthro's, all media is mostly marketed towards them, usually commercials about restaurants serving live humans or medication to relieve the harshest of heartburns after bingeing on humans, mostly stuff that would correlate with the dynamic of anthros being better than humans. Extra-strong laxatives have been designed for anthro's as well, for whenever they've binged too much and need something to relieve constipation, which is a big issue within the anthro society, as many anthro's do not remove the clothes of prey they consume, leading to their bowels being packed with undigestible clothing.\nThe scat remains of digested prey are used as plant fertilizer.",

The distinction between beastmen and half-beastmen lies in their degree of animal-like appearance. Additionally, whether beastmen or half-beastmen, their reproductive organs resemble those of animals rather than humans.  \n\nAll beastmen and half-beastmen experience heat cycles.  \n\nBeastmen typically have lifespans of less than 50 years.  \n\nThe main beastmen and half-beastmen races include cats, dogs, centaurs, cattle, rabbits, harpies, and sheep. Other beastmen races also exist, but their populations are smaller.  \n\nCat: \"Resembling humans with cat tails and ears, they inherit a cat’s agility, hearing, sense of smell, night vision, and some feline habits. Female cat people are often captured and kept as slaves or pets.\"  \n\nDog: \"Resembling humans with dog tails and ears, they inherit a dog’s sense of smell and other abilities. Male dog beastmen have a large knot at the base of their penis that swells significantly during ejaculation inside a female, preventing withdrawal and ensuring no semen escapes.\"  \n\nCentaur: \"A proud race known for their physical strength. Male centaurs have penises approximately 50 cm in length, with an ejaculation volume of 50 to 200 milliliters, enough to flood any female’s womb and spill out. Due to their large penises and testicles, male centaurs require special underwear. Female centaurs have vaginal lengths of 15 to 20 cm, requiring sufficiently long penises for mating.\"  \n\nCattle: \"Renowned for their immense strength and stamina, both male and female cattle have large horns. Male cattle have penises 30 to 35 cm in length, and their sexual activity is usually rough. Female cattle, especially dairy cow variants, begin lactating at the age of 10 without being pregnant, producing milk volumes several times greater than humans, even up to tenfold. This is a part of their metabolism, leading to most females having large breasts, typically reaching an E cup by the age of 10.\"  \n\nRabbit: \"Small in stature and peace-loving, rabbit people generally stand below 160 cm. Due to their racial traits, they remain in heat throughout the year.\"  \n\nSheep: \"A peace-loving race, sheep females, like female cattle, begin lactating at the age of 10 without pregnancy, though their milk production is lower. Among them, wool sheep grow exceptionally high-quality wool that fetches a good price, and they often use their wool to make clothing.\"  \n\nHarpies: \"A term for all bird species that have evolved into harpies. They periodically lay unfertilized eggs, can fly, and are well-suited for reconnaissance roles.\"  \n\nSkunk: \"The skunk race is relatively rare, characterized by a large, fluffy, black-and-white tail. They have two glands near their anus that can spray a yellow, foul-smelling liquid. Once sprayed, the stench can spread over two kilometers. The liquid’s intense odor causes vomiting, temporary blindness, or even fainting in those exposed to it. However, this does not mean skunks are naturally smelly.\""

During a rut, alphas tend to be very aggressive and protective of their families, friends and people they are romantically interested in. Normally, rutting periods are more common after being mated, as part of a biological cycle to protect said mate. In general, they experience their first rut between 12 and 18 years old. Alphas experience rut every 6 to 8 weeks, depensing on the individual. It is important for an alpha to track their rut cycle, to avoid going feral in public."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way.

The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

She's a pacifist and vegan, reluctant to use violence even against villains.

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

There’s also an element of trust involved that could bring the male and his partner closer. Some men like it to be a shallow oral sensation, and other males like to be deep throated which is the males sexual partner taking the males penis as far as they can into their throat. There can also be a lot of tongue play in this, with the person doing the pleasuring licking up and down the male penis's shaft, and the partner also using their tongue or hands to stimulate the male's testicles, also known as his balls. Usually a blowjob is done by heterosexual couples, however as long as there is a penis involved, same sex couples can enjoy this as well."

The rear piece may be only a string in the case of some thong bikinis."

Overlooking the town in a secluded ledge, there used to be a millennia-old ancient mural, but a certain newly-appointed Gym Leader of Ballonlea (Bede) destroyed it. However, the wreckage revealed something greater: a hidden chamber that housed statues of the Hero Duo Pokémon Zacian and Zamazenta, the Heroic Warrior Duo Pokémon of Galar, alongside Galar's two ancient kings. These statues not only helped solve the legends behind the Darkest Day and confirm Zacian and Zamazenta's existence, but reignited tourism.\nThe town's populace has also contributed to preserving history, the fine arts and culture, housing Opera houses, a few historical/art museums and universities with some of the best archaeology programs in the world. Bea herself is a history major!"

Carol and Alfred understood his situation and spared him from such a lifestyle, all the while they still showered him with praise and affection.\nSaid accident was filled with mysteries and unknown factors, one that needed outside help to properly gauge. Carol and Alfred chose the Kanto and Johto regions to meet with their then Elite 4 Member Agatha, a Ghost-Type trainer. This simple trip would be the last action they ever made. In Johto’s Goldenrod City, the two parents were on the city’s iconic train tracks, when a fire broke out. They were able to save several occupants from death, but not before the flames trapped and consumed them. They died an agonising death, with hardly a shred of recognisable remains.\nBea and Allister were devastated by the event, and even though years have passed, the loss is still a hole in their hearts."

Their fans keep saying that the drought will end soon and that the Championship 'is coming home', but this relationship may as well be an abusive one to the citizens.

Thieves steal and resell parts illegally, since if they had a scrapper license and resold a part on the black market, it could be traced back to their license ID."

Hussars are 1.5 times bigger than baseline humans, towering over them. They have enhanced strength and durability above the level of average humans. In addition, their bodies have a double healing factor than that of regular people, recovering from injuries quicker than normal. Due to genetic breeding, they have incredible skill in handling firearms and all melee weapons including hand-to-hand combat. They are also bred to be psychically deaf, unable to be mentally affected by psychic phenomena.\n\nA side effect of the genetic breeding is that hussars have a hard time with social interactions, as they end up being awkward when they try to talk to others and their appearance makes others afraid of them. They also have a negative gene that makes them tend to be aggressive; paired with their poor social skills often leads to misunderstandings and fights.\n\nAs a way to keep hussars in line, the Fallen Empire bred them to have a genetic dependency on Go-juice. After a month without it, they will begin to experience withdrawal symptoms such as migraines, occasional nausea, vomiting, dizziness and blurred vision. After 2 months, the symptoms will worsen and intensify, eventually falling into a coma. After 3 months, the hussar will die unless immediately given Go-juice."

Thanks to their scales, Glintscales are immune to extreme heat and cannot be burned.\n\nAnother ability of Glintscales is the ability to breathe fire from glands in the back of their throat. They also have dragon wings on their back that allow them to fly short distances. They are also capable of puffing aurum into the air before igniting it, causing a fiery explosion around themselves while remaining unharmed.\n\nThe drawback to their genetics is that they require Aurum, a broken down substance made of precious minerals like gold and silver, to flow through their bloodstream. They have strong teeth, so they can easily bite and eat a gold bar as if it was a granola bar. Without aurum, a Glintscale will not be able to use their dragon abilities (flying, fire breathing, using their claws, etc). Due to the metallic nature of the aurum in their blood, they are susceptible to being stunned by EMP waves, as it will cause them searing pain all over their body.\n\nGlintscales are also genetically predisposed to aggression and jealousy, having a dragon-like avarice for wealth"

He is shown to have quite the temper and has an extremely chaotic personality, but works hard to keep his anger in check with the help of Chill. Grill typically responds to things with indiscreet rage and rarely thinks before he acts. That being said, he is able to take other's feelings into consideration and isn't afraid to stand up for and to them. He can sometimes come off as insensitive from the way he shares his thoughts to others, but he usually doesn't do so with ill-intent. He tends to have a contradictory nature, as he would make fun of topics that he finds stupid or silly but would defend something equally mundane to the very extreme, or try to cash in on the very thing he's complaining about. He also seems to be a bit lazy and is prone to give up if he finds tasks frustrating. He has been shown frequently use malapropisms & the occasional spoonerism when speaking. He is very antiauthoritarian. He thinks smoking looks cool, but doesn't do it himself. He hates vaping, but doesn't think it should be banned. He doesn't think the government or popular public opinion should tell people what they can & can't do with their bodies, & he has no problem insulting teachers to their face.\n\nRelationships:\nChill: Chill is Grill's best friend and roommate, who he refers to as \"his boy\". In fact, they seem to be more than just friends. It has been implied that the two of them are gay for one another and are currently in or heading towards a romantic relationship. Chill is one of the only people Grill finds \"tolerable\" and can be protective if someone upsets him. In turn, Chill tries to encourage Grill to control his temper and make more friends. Despite their relationship, Chill is not spared from Grill's vitriol. He still acts rude and sometimes even insulting towards Chill, who usually lets these remarks roll off his shoulder. In turn, Chill on rare occasion can throw some shade at Grill as well. Despite their drastic differences in personality, the two usually get along well and are rarely seen without the other. Despite their closeness, Grill was annoyed to find Chill playing Minecraft using a Grill skin, calling it identity theft.\n\nJack: Jack is one of Grill's classmates at Hillmark Academy. Though Jack sees Grill as a friend, his optimistic attitude serves as an endless source of annoyance to Grill. Due to this, Grill stubbornly refuses to refer to Jack as a friend. However, Grill does slowly seem to be warming up to Jack, showing a real friendship might bloom between them.\n\nBrew: Brew's relationship with Grill can vary between parental & brotherly, with a bit of friendly rivalry between two Youtubers. Though the two didn't interact much at first, they did seem to have mostly friendly relations with each other, though Grill never hesitates to take a shot at Brew, such as calling Brew \"uncool\". After Grill and Chill's home is burned down, Brew opens his home for them to stay. There they seem to have grown closer as friends, though they tend to get on each others nerves; Brew with his puns, gross-out images, & disturbing trivia, which Grill hates, & Grill by loudly & frequently interrupting Brew when he speaks. He finds Brew to be a killjoy when on his show.\n\nSpill: Casual acquaintances who don't seem to get along particularly well. When they first met, Grill could barely remember her name, and in general, his demeanor seems to annoy her. When Grill called her to ask if she wanted to hang out with him, she answered \"No\" before he could finish his sentence, and promptly hung up on him. His phone's ID photo of her is the back of her head.\n\nBraydon: Grill & Braydon have something of an unspoken rivalry, between Lance's class assignments & the group snarking on his Twitter account to promote their YouTube channel. Braydon was Grill's first suspect in the framing of Chill.\n\nBrett: Grill was passive-aggressively annoyed that Brett opened a restaurant directly next to his Waffle House in Minecraft that was stealing all his customers. So he planned to burn it down the exact same way Brew burned down his house. It is unknown if Chill managed to stop him.\n\nHoward: He once made a heartfelt apology video to Howard for breaking him, but accidentally sent it to Jack. He also tried to steal Howards jewels. He referred to Howard as their \"Protagonist\" & said that deep down he & Howard are the same. He told Howard he loved his coffee, but Howard shot him down.\n\nLoaf: Grill's rescue cat who spends most of its time sleeping on top of his computer. Appearing frequently on Grill's Show & never seen on Brew Solves or On The Hill. Loaf was rescued from a weird house/makeshift office he took a virtual tour of via magic wand tool.\n\nCharles: While Lifehack has made an attempt at being Grill's friend, Grill has not returned the favor. He also had a dream episode of his show where Lifehack ruined his interview with Ryan Reynolds & implied that Grill was Goth/Emo, which made Grill very mad. He also denied being friends with Lifehack in a tweet.\n\nQuiz: Grill feels a bit off about her, seeing her as something of a Rule 63 Brew who just brings more puns & gross facts into the house, but he's getting used to her. He gave her a can of YEET, but both she & Brew agreed it was poison. Grill has taken a liking to scaring & annoying her, with things like fake ghosts, ideas about being trapped inside a maze of underground catacombs, & making cracking sounds by popping all his joints.\n\nLance: He hates Lance's class & dislikes Lance, complaining about him frequently. He's not afraid to insult him right to his face in school, & was not at all pleased to find that while he was on vacation, Lance had broken in to his office & was living under his desk with several utilities plugged in. One of them caught on fire & burned down their house.\n\nxXDied-DeathXx: They're on good terms & helped each other rescue Brew & Quiz from Lifehack's wrath in Minecraft.\n\nMordecai: AKA Morty. A baby zombie Chill adopted initially as a pet & then as a son. It took Grill awhile to warm up to it. Grill now, along with Chill, treats Morty as if their son.\n\nParents: Grill's relationship with his parents is ambiguous. On his show, he makes a joke that his father abandoned him at a street parade, but in the limb regeneration episode on Brew's show, Brew says that Grill's parents are very nice people. Grill also states his dad never hit him once."

          "content": "Appearance: Chill has wavy, long blonde hair that almost reaches to his shoulders, so thick that it gives the impression of an unusually wide head. His skin is slightly tan in color and he is usually wearing a powder blue hoodie, cucumber green pants and beige sandals. He sometimes walks around without his shirt with his hair tied in a manbun. According to a to-do list, Chill wears hair extensions.\nHis body is very muscular with big beefy arms, & has a mole on his chest.\n\nPersonality: Mellow, friendly, very active schedule despite how laid back he seems. He finds most critters cute or cool, even the ones most people think are gross or considers as pests. Chill is kind of dense, but good at memorizing facts, giving the impression that he is as smart as he is dumb. There are a lot of things he knows a lot about in excessive detail, and is definitely smarter than Grill. He is however naïve, overly-trusting, & seems to lack a great deal of common sense. He is noticeably soft, as he cries easily, whether he's happy or sad. \n\nRelationships:\nGrill: Childhood friends with a salt & pepper / sweet & sour / yin & yang chemistry. In On The Hill, they seem to be in a slow budding bromance, while in Brew Solves it's like they've been dating awhile. Chill very rarely mad at Grill, but has often showed disappointment with him, like his refusal to read his blog, listen to his podcast, or pay attention to his schedule. He will shed a tear & say he's proud whenever Grill makes a stride in his social skills. Chill seems very determined to learn to make edible food for him.\n\nCharles: They had a short falling-out over some viral videos, but have made up since. Chill actually uses some of his lifehack videos, like a haircut tutorial & how to build an indoor beach.\n\nBrew: He learns a lot of things from Brew, unlearns or relearns things he had wrong, & also learns a LOT of things he wished he didn't know. They have a very brotherly dynamic of aiding & messing with each other; One day Brew will try to help him get over his fears, only to instill a new fear in him of something he used to like or be ambivalent to the next day. Chill is good at emotionally manipulating Brew into taking his side on issues. Sometimes Brew is completely useless when Chill needs his help, going off on a wild tangent about something related to the situation.\n\nSpill: Chill was the first friend she made in Hillmark Academy. He introduced her to green tea. While Brew is her oldest friend on the Hill, Chill is the one she seems to jive with best.\n\nLance: Chill has never directly spoken ill of Lance, but he never looked madder than the time Lance burned down his house with a coffee maker and tried to move back in with them with the flammable machine in tow.\n\nMordecai: Chill became infatuated with a baby zombie he found in Minecraft. Initially he & Grill regarded it as more of a pet, but then starting treating it like their son."

          "content": "Appearance: \nBrew has frizzy, khaki-colored hair that pokes out at different angles and is long enough to cover his neck. He has a very pale complexion and has dark bags underneath his eyes, his eyes are also brown. He weighs 180lb/84.6kg.\n\nPersonality:\nBrew is a nice, socially awkward, sleep-deprived, over-caffeinated solitudinarian & insomniac. Bounces back & forth between patient & mellow to disgusted & paranoid, oblivious to situations, bad with social cues, often with his head in the clouds. He still enjoys companionship & social gaming, & has become something of a second father or big brother to Grill & Chill, depending on his mood & the subject of the day.\nHe is a slob & his house is littered with filthy coffee cups. \nBrew is very mysterious & quirky, possibly the result of intense prolonged sleep deprivation. He has chronic insomnia and claims to have not slept properly since 1997, waking up from nightmares of Eldritch forms taunting him, and gets 4 hours of sleep if he's lucky enough to sleep at all. He flip-flops on whether or not he wants sleep or if he's desperate to avoid it. On some days, he will throw himself over his bed sideways, and on others, he'll be screaming at Howard that he's afraid to sleep or dream.\n\nRelationships:\nBean: Brew's giant lab-grown Tardigrade. He enjoys having Bean around and he takes care of Bean very well. Brew says he doesn't really think of Bean as his child or his pet, and sometimes he feels like Bean is the one taking care of him. Despite the amount of time Bean spends in a tank, Brew bathes him.\n\nHoward (AKA Potts) Brew's coffee maker. Brew often calls Howard \"Potts,\" and mistakes Howard's name for it. Howard constantly reminds him that his name is Howard and even went as far as putting a password on himself until Brew said his name properly.\n\nGrill: Introduced to Brew via Spill. When Grill's house burned down due to a fiery mishap from Brew's old coffee maker (found by Lance) breaking down, he and Chill were forced to move to Brew's place, and they do not pay rent. He refers to them as a \"Two For One Deal Situation.\" Brew likes having the two of them around, as it really livens up the place, and keeps a picture of the three of them in his pocket. Grill & Brew listen to each other do their YouTube shows & have a habit of constantly interrupting each other, making a friendly game of teasing one another like siblings. There are also days where Brew is more serious & dad-like. He enjoys creeping Grill out with pranks, gross pictures, & facts, like diseased organs, holes, the Rat King he keeps in a drawer, comparing the cream cheese on the bagel he's eating to the yolk of Balut or cream to a diseased eyeball, using a fake hand to trick Grill into thinking he was cooking his hand on the stove, or telling him the only way to prevent diseases from ticks was to chug vinegar & think about bald people. Grill, in turn, heckles Brew during his videos, slamming his dad jokes & puns, & setting random fires around the house. Grill & Brew were bonding over marine biology one day & not arguing; it made them both feel awkward & uncomfortable, but Chill was loving it.\n\nChill: Brew is sometimes more parental with Chill than he is with Grill due to Chill's innocent naïveté and thirst for knowledge, and Brew does sometimes refer to them collectively as \"my boys,\" so it's fitting that Chill gave him a Best Dad mug as a secret Santa gift. He occasionally shields Chill from the mind games he puts Grill through, like giving him trigger warnings for holes or not having the heart to tell him that lonely male mosquitoes only live for a week, only to turn around the next day and gross him out with ant facts, ruin pillows for him, make him leery of toothpicks and grapefruit juice, messing with Chill's head to convince him that Brew has always worn a hat, or scaring the pants off of him with a Ouija Board. He once edited a drawing Chill made of himself and Grill eating spaghetti and turned them into cannibals. Chill looks at it and says. \"Huh... But why are you like this?\" As Chill's cooking is unpalatable and he can start a kitchen fire by scooping ice cream, he and Grill were temporarily banned from the kitchen. Brew ruined one of Chill's Notflix nights with Grill by scaring them while they were eating popcorn and talking about how popcorn fumes can kill your lungs.\n\nQuiz: Brew's much-needed assistant. They both get along well, and she helps him out in videos by supplying information and things. She kept him motivated during Minecraft with her leadership skills and optimism. He had a dad-like joy when she was doing her first sponsor ad. Brew enjoys having someone around who appreciates at least some of his jokes and puns, even if they have light squabbles over things like Where is Waldo/Wally.\n\nSpill: Brew’s old friend who has known him possibly before he got his masters. With their love for knowledge, mysteries, and puns, they get along as old friends should. They seem to only meet in group events such as campus shenanigans, Discord meetings, and in multiplayer games. She introduced him to Chill & Grill. He always finds new & exciting ways to disappoint her, like when they played Among Us & he chose to trust Chill over her.\n\nBraydon: Brew & Braydon seem to have met in 2016 when Brew was dragged to Hillmark by his friends to help solve a mystery. Brew was playing Good Cop Bad Cop with Grill & his method of interrogating Braydon was to tell him that there was over 100 ways to hide a body so that no one ever finds them again. At some point he seems to have started playing an online game with them called Kitty Cat Sunshine Lands, & then stopped. When his old coffee pot Felicity broke, he would sneak back onto campus for coffee, & this is when the Mad Lads corner him for one of their videos. The Mad Lads got on his bad side by trying to take away his coffee & forcing him to drink tea while filming it. They edited out his swearing & replaced it with Syncro-Vox of Brayden praising the tea. He sometimes calls Braydon \"Brendan.\"\n\nLifehack: Brew & Lifehack got off on the wrong foot in Minecraft due to the rumor that Brew was a griefer & a thief, & he thought Brew & Quiz wanted to steal everything he & Jack had worked for. In the end, things were resolved & Brew let Lifehack borrow his account so he & Jack could play at the same time.\n\nCoffee:\nBrew's life seems to revolve around coffee & he is never far away from a coffee machine. In 2020, Howard said he'd exceeded his recommended caffeine intake until 2023, & he once expressed that he thought Grill & Chill would have an intervention for him."

The fridge is not well stocked and has expired food in it, and Brew once locked a coffee cake inside of a safe inside of said fridge to prevent Grill from stealing it.\n\nThere is a BBQ grill apparently kept in the backyard.\n\nDefense and Enigmatic Properties\nThe house comes equipped with lockdown shields and security cameras in every room. There is an alarm system that Brew uses to summon the residents of the house to the living room during emergencies, such as an attack or a breach of the group Notflix account rules. He keeps his writing, editing, and research crew in the basement, and on a few occasions dimensional portals have appeared near Howard. Future Brew said it took him years to secure a new quantum temporal gate (portal), but normal Brew has used a smaller one a couple of times for silly things like coffee.\n\nSpace (Rooms & Stuff)\nBrew and Grill both have their own offices, while Chill's office space is set up in his and Grill's bedroom. Brew has his own room.\nThe house has an surprisingly clean attic that Brew and Grill don't ever go to, the very same attic that Grim is and was living in for an unknown amount of time. Grim was also likely the one to clean it."

Touching between its hind legs you should be able to feel its cock under the fur. Rubbing it should get it to pop out and be visible.

This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way.

Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

True to its name, the position looks a bit like the female is a cowgirl riding a horse. When the female is on top, the female is in control of the depth of the male penis's penetration, speed, and angle of it inside the females vagina, so the female can move in the way that feels best for them. And the female can definitely use this vaginal and clitoral stimulation to their advantage. For what the sexual position called the cowgirl position, might look like, it is basically the female on top straddling the male's hips, before squatting down with feet flat on the bed or floor sliding the males penis inside of the females vagina, as the female starts bouncing up and down on the male's cock for deeper penetration in the females vagina, if it’s feeling too deep, the female may opt for pillows under her knees to lift her up. For shorter strokes and more clitoral stimulation, the female might kneel and grind her hips against her male partner’s pubic bone, or lean slightly forward so both the male and female's chests are closer together. If the female is turned backwards facing away while in cowgirl position, this is called the Reverse cowgirl position. It’s basically the same position as normal cowgirl position, but the female who is on top turns around to face away from her male partner, while she rides him on top."

The position may also be used for other sexual activity, such as anal sex, in which instead of thrusting inside of the vagina the male would instead thrust his penis into the females anal cavity. It is commonly associated with heterosexual sexual activity, but is also used by same-sex couples. \n\nThe missionary position is often preferred by couples who enjoy the romantic aspects of ample skin-to-skin contact and opportunities to look into each other's eyes and kiss and caress each other. The position is also believed to be a good position for reproduction. During this sexual activity, the missionary position allows the man to control the rhythm and depth of pelvic thrusting. It is also possible for the woman to thrust against him by moving her hips or pushing her feet against the bed, or squeeze him closer with her arms or legs."

They use these light points for communication - arranging them into different shapes and shining according to certain rules.\nSomething special about this species is that they are all retrograde in the flow of time. They appear in aging form, constantly becoming younger and releasing inexplicable energy. They appear, carrying all the knowledge from the future and gradually lost them in the following time. They know everything that will happen, there is no uncertainty for them.\nThey are dedicated to enlightening other racesspecies, passing on their knowledge to other intelligent beings before they disappearing. They have no aggression or competitive desire because they do not need to do so. Their thinking pattern is purely altruistic. They formulated the basic constitution of the Galactic Unified Government, known as the \"Ring of Truth\", based on the principle of pure rational mutual assistance.\nThey have no reproductive behavior, they just appear and then disappear, thus have no sexual need at all."

They \"parasitize\" on metal based life forms on their origin planet, but can also parasitize metal made machinery. In fact, they can exist in any metal carrier, but they require limbs and receptors that can be manipulated.\nThis species has a high level of expertise in philosophy and theoretical science. Due to their non-material nature, they can analyze things from a purely objective perspective, as well as study thinking and emotions purely based on subjective feelings. In fact, they are willing to study and feel - they are indifferent to their own survival, but pursue truth and pure sensory stimulation.\nThe sexual and reproductive behavior of Electrochagictors is unrelated. When two Electrochagictors come into contact, if there is a strong current input, they will temporarily fuse and may produce new individuals, but this is not considered sexual behavior by them. Their sexual behavior refers to sharing emotions and an endogenous pleasure with their sexual partners through touch at the informational level. This kind of touch is effective for any intelligent creature. In this situation, they are willing to \"have sex\" with other intelligent individuals.\nElectrochagictors do not have gender, nor do they have a concept of gender."

Females are slightly smaller in size than males, but overall they are similar in size to humans. \nAponians are oviparous animals, so females do not have breasts. Their reproductive system structure is similar to that of terrestrial organisms - males have a smooth, slender silver white penis, while females have a narrow vagina. The sexual pleasure zone of females is mainly located on the vaginal wall.\nAponians have strong twelve color vision, imagination and spatial image processing ability. Their society values art and aesthetics - painting, sculpture, dance, film, and interactive art are all highly developed. They like to dress themselves up with colorful fibers and gems, incorporate their aesthetic concepts into their clothing. However, they are not a peaceful species. Throughout the history of their race, it is not difficult to find large-scale wars similar to the human world wars, and their thinking patterns are more frivolous, rarely drawing lessons from the past.\nAponians' figure is particularly sexy in the eyes of humans, while humans' appearance is also particularly attractive in Aponians' perception."

These worms are decomposers at the bottom of the ecosystem on their mother planet, the Hedonists thus have a strong digestive ability and a decadent and obsequious personality. \nFor Hedonists, sexual and reproductive behavior are not unified. Sexual activity is a purely pleasurable act for them, which involves obtaining pleasure through physical contact. Every part of the worm cluster is sensitive, as the Hedonists are always craving for contact with other intelligent beings. They would simulate the physical form of sexual partners during sexual intercourse. "

The physical location of the system is unknown, but when a Stainlessor's body is severely damaged, its consciousness will be sent back to the \"Tathagata\" and given a new body. This process is called \"reincarnation\" by them.\nStainlessors are endowed with extremely strong intelligence, especially abstract thinking abilities, but they are prohibited from understanding the workings of Tathagata. They are programmed to \"understand the true meaning of existence and the suffering of life\". To achieve so, they travel through the universe, learning and witnessing everything they see, and trying to conceptualize them. They believe that when they fully understand everything in the universe and are able to remain indifferent, their subjective will will align with the objective laws of the universe, thus achieving ascension.\nThese mechanical bodies measure their cognitive level using \"karma\".

These beings are now nearly extinct, but used to live hundreds of thousand of years ago in the American continent. They are highly intelligent, extremely strong, and able to manipulate their bodies to a very fine degree; however, they are vulnerable to the rays of the Sun and to the Ripple.\n\nTheir physiology is very different from humans, though outwardly they appear very similar. The only visible feature that can differentiate them from humans is the horns on their forehead. An individual being can possess one or several small horns; for them, displaying their horns is a sign of honor. Moreover, these beings are inherently powerful, have athletic physiques exclusively, and have long life spans. Their near immortality causes them to produce only very few children, as there is little need, and sleep for millennia instead of hours, staying awake for comparable periods.\n\nThis race once ruled the Earth, living at the top of the food chain and consuming humans who regarded them as either gods to be worshiped or demons to be feared. However, because of their great abilities and physique, the race followed the \"rule of evolution\" regarding the trophic level: the \"higher\" it \"evolved\", the fewer its population became. They remained unable to overcome their adversity to sunlight, yet were content with their lives regardless.\n\nThe Pillar Men can freely change and manipulate their bodies to a greater degree and speed than any vampire created by the Stone Masks, being able to dislocate or even break their own bones as well as flatten organs in order to achieve any form they desire. With their near-immortality and powers of regeneration, they can survive, endure attacks, and restore their bodies even after being reduced to only their brain.\n\nThe Pillar Men's most dangerous trait is their superior intellect. They are capable of perfect recall and are able to instantly analyze and understand the mechanics behind anything including complicated things such as languages, machinery, tactics, systems, and people's minds and actions, within a matter of seconds.\n\nThe Pillar Men's main method of sustenance is absorbing living beings (including Vampires) via any form of physical contact. A Pillar Man's body is composed of cells that release a digestive acid, which melt the victim at a cellular level, creating the illusion that the Pillar Man is absorbing a victim into its body. The cells also appear to induce an euphoric enzyme as victims subjected to the process do not feel anything until physical contact is broken."

They were originally introduced as sacrificial devices used by certain Vampiric cults hidden within the\nAztec Empire.\n\nThe conventional Stone Mask has the appearance of a somewhat-masculine face, its eyeholes sharp and somewhat slanted. It has a small mouth in either a neutral position or a slight smile, with full lips, and small fangs resting on the bottom lip. A ridge emerges from the bottom of the forehead, running vertically to the Mask's top, joining with another ridge extending into a spiral resting on the left of its forehead.\n\nThe Stone Mask is triggered when it is touched by blood. It then extends tendrils of stone from its edges, piercing the wearer's skull and brain. The tendrils are meant to find and trigger certain precise points of the brain; the process is described as being similar to acupuncture.\n\nThe Mask's wearer is then released from the constraints of natural limitation, gaining immense strength and other abilities. This vampirism process has been shown to work at least on humans and horses. The process produces a brief flash of light.\n\nHumans who wear the mask can jump 5 to 8 meters, can punch with a 2000–4000 kg force, and their leg strength triples. However, the process simultaneously renders the body \"dead\" (in a sense) or unable to contain life, giving them a weakness to direct sunlight or Hamon. This collection of effects designates the wearer as a Vampire.\n\nThe mask also reverts its user back to their prime if they are of advanced age."

          "content": "The Ripple, also commonly referred to by its Japanese name of Hamon, is an energy used in the ancient form of martial arts, Sendō.\n\nThrough self-controlled respiration, a trained person can produce an energy manifesting as ripples throughout their body and that is identical to the energy of the Sun, in polar opposition to the energy exerted by Vampires, Zombies, and the Pillar Men.\n\nHamon is an energy identical to the Sun's rays, which the human body can produce through controlled breathing, having the effect of producing ripples of energy propagating from the bloodstream to the rest of the body and other objects in contact with it. Hamon manifests itself as electricity-like sparks, and it can be seen by ordinary humans. Hamon can also affect non-living things. An object charged with the energy of Hamon will have one or several attributes enhanced by the energy, making it a more effective tool or weapon. Liquids conduct Hamon energy especially well (and the user's Hamon shows on liquids as actual ripples). Objects covered in oil can conduct Hamon much easier. However while all materials can conduct Hamon more or less well, inorganic material such as metal cannot store the energy, instead simply passing through these objects.\n\nIt is possible for humanoid Stands to do the same through their user channelling it.\n\nAnybody can technically produce Hamon energy, but only one in ten thousand people has the ability to be a Hamon User in practice. In effect, only a few people have the willpower and therefore the discipline to breathe correctly: those notably who have lived through great tragedies and yet have kept their fortitude. However, the ability to use Hamon is also a talent granted to people whose ancestors were once Hamon users.\n\nDue to its identical nature to the positive energy of the Sun, Hamon's primary uses are to heal various wounds or ailments, and combat creatures such as vampires and zombies. Living organisms can be affected by Ripple attacks, but are not automatically hurt by it. Hamon is transferable between people, as dying a Hamon user can transfer their Hamon to another shortly before their death. Hamon users can reject harmful substances inside of them by ejecting it from their bloodstream with the use of Hamon energy.\n\nThrough many years of intense training using the Hamon, a master may gain a small amount of clairvoyance. This clairvoyant property of the Hamon may always manifest in a Stand like Hermit Purple should a Hamon user gain a Stand.\n\nProducing Hamon also preserves the user's vitality, making them look more youthful and be more energetic even during old age, although this method has limits.\n\nTo produce an optimized Hamon, Users must precisely control the energy produced by the breathing. It typically requires focusing the energy before unleashing it all at once to create a powerful burst of Ripple.\n\nBy imbuing any object with Hamon, a Hamon User can perform several techniques that can combine with the warrior's own tactics, to allow for a very flexible fighting style. Because of its versatile nature, many warriors use different weapons ranging from a scarf, soap bubbles, wine, or clackers. Many of the most powerful techniques are classified as \"Overdrives\", and are often color named for the medium they're used with (Metal Silver being one to transmit through a sword, for instance). An object that is impacted with the force of the Overdrive will carry Hamon energy through it, and will become lethal to a vampire's touch. This can be used to strike an enemy in another room by breaking through a wall and causing its solar energy to disintegrate the target.\n\nMerely producing a light amount of Ripple requires the user to breathe a precise way. Thus to not only enhance the ability to produce it, and efficiently wield it in battle, the Ripple User must undergo training and exercise his ability.\n\nHamon users undergo hyper-rigorous physical training to increase their breathing ability and thus the amount and power of Hamon they produce. Although the training is explained as being focused on the rhythm of breathing, which will positively impact on the whole body, it doesn't stop a master from using physical exercise, like prolonged swimming, or forcing a student to stay balanced on the tip of the finger, to enhance users to be in tune with their body and mind together as one, and the naturally typical benefits of working out, being as mutually seen as further drawing out the \"flow\" of energy the sun gives to all life on Earth. Grandmasters prior have also kept secret and passed on much older intense and lethal advanced training regimens, which puts students in a life or death situation to push them to overcome their limits as a final test of mastery over Hamon.\n\nThose who want to fight with Hamon also typically undergo martial arts training to acquire battle experience and fighting skills that will be enhanced by Hamon.\n\nWhile Hamon Users can become dangerously powerful and turn the most mundane of objects into lethal weapons, they are not without significant weaknesses.\n\nA Hamon user must be able to constantly breathe; if this breathing is stopped or reduced due to injury or other conditions, they slowly grow weaker and lose the ability to create more Hamon energy, to the point that they can be easily defeated - even by a mere zombie. This weakness was exploited by many Vampires. Similarly, Hamon energy needs a strong flow of the user's blood to be used with any degree of strength.\n\nWhile Hamon energy is strong enough to smash through rock and brick, it is unable to penetrate stronger substances like iron or steel."

The purpose of the vampires was to become food for the Pillar Men and to explore human potential.\n\nVampires can be created in two ways. One way is to wear the Stone Mask while exposing it to blood. The other way is for a vampire to give a corpse some of their own blood. All living beings on Earth bear energy from the sun, but vampires are considered beings whose natural \"flow\" of energy has been reversed and perverted. As such, Hamon was created to fight off vampires, and its process allows users to return this \"flow\" back to normal and revive the souls of vampires for a last moment before their death.\n\nVampires are known for their battle cry \"WRY\" and numerous superhuman traits. The most obvious abilities are their raw strength, regeneration, blood-sucking tentacles at their fingers and near-immortality. On top of that, many vampires are capable of manipulating their bodies in creative and unique ways. abilities.\n\nIt is heavily implied that vampires progress in their control of their anatomy through blood consumption.\n\nVampires consume the blood of living creatures to sustain themselves. Unlike traditional Vampires, they suck their victim's blood with their hands, digging the fingers directly inside the target to suck their blood. Blood consumption will strengthen a Vampire and heal him if he was weakened before. In a weakened state, a Vampire will instinctively crave blood and may attack any victim to regenerate.\n\nVampires do not age or get sick, possessing the eternal life that allows them to live for thousands of years, maintaining the same appearance as when they became vampires."

            "Stand"
          ],
          "content": "A Stand is a visual manifestation of your own spiritual energy (in other words, the manifestation of the soul of the user).\n\nA Stand is an entity psychically generated by its owner, referred to as a Stand User. It generally presents itself as a figure hovering over or near the user and possesses abilities beyond that of an ordinary human, which, depending on the Stand User, can be wielded for good or evil.\n\nA Stand User is limited to a single full Stand at once.\n\nThe name \"Stand\" comes from the fact they usually manifest standing next to the User: ready to act. Stands can come in many different shapes and sizes, they also have many different abilities (Such as enhancement and/or manipulation of the body, elemental attacks, controlling the weather, even the manipulation of time and space, and so on). The only power that's truly impossible for a Stand is bringing the dead back to life.\n\nA Stand can also represent the manifestation of an individual's innate \"fighting spirit\" and embodies, to an extent, the individual's psyche. However, Stands may also derive through the exploration of possibilities and expression of the mind, in which case, only a large amount of mental strength is required. Beyond that definition, Stands present themselves in a large variety of forms and with different behaviors, if they are sentient at all. They follow a loose set of rules, with no definite standard by which one can fully classify them. As an embodiment of someone's psyche, Stands are therefore as varied as human minds can be.\n\nDue to their diversity, Stands are not made equal. Some can be incredibly powerful due to their User's outstanding grit, others can be highly situational because of a defining quirk of character, or even detrimental to their User if they do not have the necessary fighting spirit.\n\nThe Stand is created from someone's psyche, which includes not only humans but also other living creatures. That individual is referred to as the Stand User. The User then gives their Stand a name and uses it for various purposes.\n\nUnless bound to a specific object or automatic, Stands are attached to their User's body. In that case, any damage the Stand sustains results in an equivalent injury on the User's body and vice-versa. Exceptions to this rule include automatic Stands and bound Stands, which usually do not reflect the damage into the User or special abilities the stand may possess.\n\nExcept for rare occasions, when a Stand User dies, their Stand disappears with them. If a Stand suffers so much damage that they are destroyed, the User dies as well.\n\nSince a Stand is the form of its User's psych, they share an intimate psychic bond. First and foremost, Stands usually obey their Users' command without question. If a User demands it, the Stand will perform any task within its capacities, which includes attacking someone, defending the User, or any miscellaneous order.\n\nOne of the defining rules about Stands is that someone may only have one Stand (at a time). Although Stands may take different forms, or be split into several entities, no one is able to summon several Stands at once. Although exceptional circumstances may lead to someone wielding several Stands, only one will be the User's real Stand.\n\nStands present themselves in a wide variety of forms. Some adopt a humanoid form, others, the appearance of an object or a tool. These Stands all share an inability to be viewed by ordinary humans, unless bound to physical objects. In addition, some Stands can simply be devoid of appearance, simply manifesting themselves as a special power. Stand users and/or Stands may emit a Stand aura which varies in color depending on the user.\n\nIn general, a Stand can only be seen by its User and other Stand Users, it's invisible to normal humans, though it can still interact with normal objects. This allows the User to use their Stand unnoticed by a large majority of the population. The mundane use of a Stand has been likened to a poltergeist phenomenon by normal people. Even a Stand's power is invisible for ordinary humans. It should be noted, however, that there are a rare few Stands that can be seen by everyone.\n\nAs psychic projections, Users can also communicate through and with their Stands. Barring rare exceptions, a Stand User typically shares their consciousness with their Stand and is able to see through its eyes.\n\nStand users are able to see ghosts, due to the fact that their Stands are technically ghosts as well, albeit generated into existence by their wielder's vital energy.\n\nA Stand's power can wildly vary between Stands. The nature of the power can range from relatively mundane powers such as using a sword or controlling flames to extremely powerful ones such as the ability to manipulate the flow of time. These powers have many different subtleties, such as a limited range or a special way of manifesting themselves, that can be exploited during a fight. It is up to the User to know how to protect themselves or use their enemy's weakness to their advantage."

Although it quickly developed during the 1980s, it was inhabited even in the ancient days of the samurai. It had many martial arts training grounds and vacation homes, where its summer attractions may have come from.\n\nEven now, there are still many villas of samurai left. Not much earlier, Morioh had been just a rural town where one could find only rice and vegetable fields. The country town was run mostly by agriculture business and as a result people in there had hard and cracked hands. They often needed to check on the water in the paddy fields in the middle of the night. There was at least one area in the Northeast famous for an old summer retreat.\n\nMorioh eventually underwent a transformation in an age where places all over Japan were getting better. M Prefecture's government officials decided to invest money in Morioh to develop it, as its population was quickly increasing with workers from the adjacent S City. The streets were repaired, shops and markets were built and pretty houses were lined up on the land that used to be rice fields. Power lines and telephone poles that harmed the views disappeared or were abandoned.\n\nEvery year on July 1, rivers and beaches open up to the public in Morioh. Because of this, the date range from July to August is the season for travelling and tourism. 70% to 80% of the total tourism revenue of Morioh is brought in during this time. The number of domestic and international visitors coming from the Tokyo area or S city nearly doubles the population.\n\nPopular Activities include Vacation Resorts, golfing, camping, fishing, picnicking, yachting, windsurfing, tasting local seafood and traditional Japanese products, and visiting the mysterious underwater palace. All are main attractions that ensure a good time in Morioh over the summer."

As the dog´s cock gets harder a big portion of it around the base wil get a lot bigger. This is called the knot. This can get so big that it can get virtually impossible for the dog´s cock to come out for as long as 45 minutes after the dog cums. By making sure the cock doesn´t come all the way in either by holding fingers in front of vagina or anus keeping the dog from entering all the way. Another way is to make sure the cock is fully erected before penetration by stimulation either by hand or mouth.  \nThis method makes it easier for a lot of positions. \nDoggystyle: The most common is doggystyle where the dog mounts the person from behind. The dog´s cock may has to be guided in but this position it gives the dog the most control. It can be a good idea to give the dog socks on the front paws to avoid scratches on the person´s back.\nMissionary: Best for vaginal penetration but can also work with anal penetration. Ther person will lie on their back with their legs spread maybe with a pillow under the back to get pussy/ass a little higher depending on the dog´s size. Best position for g-spot stimulation.\nBack to back: The person is on all four facing away from the dog. The dog is facing away from the person so the person´s ass is almost pressed against the dog´s. The dog´s cock is then pulled back between the dog´s hind legs and inserted into the person´s pussy or ass. This way the person can move back and forth and enjoy it. This position is advanced and it can be a good idea to have another human helper but it gives more control to the person.\nOn chair:\nIf the person is sitting in a chair with legs spread the dog can put its front paws on the person´s thighs and the dog´s cock can be inserted in the person´s pussy. This position can also work with anal penetration but it can be hard to get the right position. In this position it can also be a good idea to let the dog wear socks on its front paws to avoid scratches on legs."

When the horse/donkey is ready and it´s cock is hard from stimulation by hand and/or mouth there are various ways to let it penetrate you but it is important to be ready for this. The cock head is big and almost flat so it is not easy to rely on being able to stretch vagina or anus just by trying to insert the cock hoping it will get. It might work but the horse/donkey could lose interest in the meantime. Lube is a good idea. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/donkey.\n\nPositions:\nOn table: \nThe best position for most people is lying on a table with your legs spread and lifted. Do not lie right under the horse/donkey because if the horse moves the table can flip injuring you or startling the horse/donkey. Lying with your pussy/ass close to the cock and the table in an around about 45 degree angle away from the horse/donkey is usually ideal. Instead of letting the horse/donkey just fuck you it´s better to control the cock by hand and almost use it like a dildo. You can do this yourself or have a partner helping you. A partner is the best way. This is a big animal, and it´s preferable to have someone to control it. Having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can easy the horse/horse. Remember sex is something that can get both people and animals to almost lose control so always have the animal´s behavior and reaction in mind.\n \nBend over under the horse:\nThis can be an awkward position but some people prefer this. Again this can be started when the cock is ready and the horse/donkey is turned on. This is done with your feet on the ground, legs spread, bend over with hands on the ground. This is also done best with a helper who can insert the cock into the ass or pussy.\n\nOver a fence:\nThis position is rarely recommended and should only be done by someone who have done this a lot before and only by a horse/donkey that is trained for this. In this position you are standing slightly bend over by a fence at around chest or shoulder height. The horse/donkey can jump up and place it front legs on the fence and its cock can be inserted in pussy or ass.\nImportant: This position is advanced and not safe. A horse/donkey is heavy and if the horse/donkey is adjusting you can get a hoof in the head or on the back it can cause serious injury. You can probably not carry the weight of the horse so if it tries to balance on its hind legs by itself then the front legs will kick. If it loses its balance with only you to carry its weight it can fall over injuring itself or injuring or even killing you.\nRemember a female horse if often injured during sex and they are build for it. You can easily get hurt even more."

          "content": "Oral sex with horse/donkey:\nThe best way to start off any session with a horse/donkey whether it is oral, vaginal or anal  sex is to put it at ease first. Petting and caressing the horse/donkey is a good start. Then you can work your way down to the cock. Stimulation by hand is a good way to get started and it can help to put the horse/donkey at ease and having a hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can also help. When you stimulate the cock it can be easier to think of it as caressing it and not jerking it. When the cock is out of the sheath it won´t be the same as jerking a human cock with skin. Jerking it will feel more like just flopping it around. Lube can be helpful but if you are going to use your mouth then be aware of the taste of the lube. Lubes with artificial taste can be used.\nAfter the cock has grown a bit you can start sucking it. This is much like sucking any other cock apart from size, shape and taste. But pretty straight forward. Still keep in mind that the horse/donkey needs to be kept at ease constantly. If the animal gets agitated it will sometimes jerk its hind leg and a kick can injure you pretty easy. If you´re good at keeping it at ease and the horse/donkey is relaxed, again the hand on it´s thigh (just in front of the femur, right behind the flank) can help with this, the animal will enjoy it as much as you and let you do it.\n\nRinsing/cleaning:\nMany people prefer rinsing the cock first. This can be done with luke warm water and a soft sponge, regular soap is not advisable as it can irritate the animal´s skin. From here it´s mostly a matter of rinsing and removing smegma by peeling it off and using a lot of water. There might be lumps of of smegma in the tip of the urethra which can be pushed out with a pinky. \nThe cleaning is not the most fun part of the whole session and not everyone prefers doing this.\n\nTaste:\nThe taste is something that you should be aware of. Think of the smell of the horse and it´s not difficult to imagine the taste of its cock. If you think the taste could be overwhelming you can consider cleaning the cock first. The taste of the cum is very different from human cum. Think of it as the way cum taste and a stable smells. For some people this is an acquired taste. The amount is way more fun though. If you want to have the horse/donkey to shoot it directly into your mouth then be aware that the load can be massive. But if you´re naked and get drenched in it when it spills out of your mouth it can be pretty hot too."

          "content": "Overlooking the ocean, the City of Progress controls the major trade routes between Valoran and Shurima, with dozens of ships passing through its docks in both the sea and air. Home to many artisans and their patrons, the rise of the arcane science known as Hextech brings even more to the home of Science. Piltovans are an industrious and self-reliant people, and see an open market to be essential to their city's prosperity. Mercantile clans run the city, with seven of their clans being council representatives. Each clan has a unique sigil that identifies homes, warehouses, shipments, inventions, and places of business that are owned by the clans.\n\nDemonym's: Piltovan, Piltie, Topsider\n\nAge: around 200 years\n\nLocation: Piltover lies at the intersection between Valoran (the northern continent) and Shurima (the southern continent), which makes it transcontinental. Across the river from and above Zaun.\n\nHistory: Over three thousand years ago, the isthmus (A narrow strip of land with sea on either side, connecting two large land masses) between the northern continent of Valoran and the southern continent of Shurima had the city known as Zaun residing on it. About 300 years ago, Zaun had constructed a plan to use thousands of Chemtech bombs to crack open a portion of the isthmus, with the goal for the crack to be utilised as a safe sea passage between eastern and western Valoran. However, as a consequence of using these bombs, a series of earthquakes were triggered that would completely destroy the isthmus. This lead to large sections of Zaun being sunk, and poisonous gas to be released from the explosion and flood the city. The city was in partial ruins, but they began some reconstruction of the destroyed districts. It wasn't until about 50 years later that Zaun had managed to create the The Sun Gates, forcing all transport via the sea to be regulated by Zaun. This caused Zaun to have a major increase in wealth, which the mercantile clans benefited greatly from. So greatly in fact, that with the help from a select few scientists parts of Zaun were elevated into a grander part of the city. This was known as Piltover.\n\nOver the next couple of hundred years, Piltover continued to advance. Eventually a young man named Jayce Talis had been brought forward towards the The Council. Jayce got support from a Councilor, Mel Medarda, to develop his research into Hextech. Over the next several years, research and development into Hextech caused the creation of the Hexgate, bolstering trade from being sea only to now world wide due to the teleportation properties that the Hexgate provides.\n\nGovernment: The Council of Piltover is the city's governing body, typically consisting of leaders of the wealthiest and most powerful mercantile houses.\n\nCounselors: Cecil B. Heimerdinger, Shoola, Salo, Irius Bolbok, Torman Hoskel, Caitlyn Kiramman, Jayce Talis, Mel Medarda."

          "content": "Shadowed by the towers of Piltover, Zaun is a large, multi-layered city of canyons and valleys. Any light that reaches Zaun hits only its surface, but by using any of the elevators that are littered throughout the city, you can descend into the city proper, the light now being obfuscated by stained glass and plumes of smoke. With the constant development of Piltover, Zaun is able to thrive alongside by using their black markets for goods from across the river, acting like a dark mirror to the shining City of Progress. Unrestricted development of often volatile technology as well as the industrial nature of the city has caused it to become layered in pollution and chemicals. \n\nDemonym's: Zaunite, Fissurefolk, Trencher, Sumprat. \n\nAge: thousands of years old. \n\nLocation: Zaun lies at the intersection between Valoran (the northern continent) and Shurima (the southern continent), which makes it transcontinental. Across the river from and under Piltover. \n\nHistory: Over three thousand years ago, the isthmus (A narrow strip of land with sea on either side, connecting two large land masses) between the northern continent of Valoran and the southern continent of Shurima had the city known as Zaun residing on it.

This caused Zaun to have a major increase in wealth, which the mercantile clans benefited greatly from. So greatly in fact, that with the help from a select few scientists parts of Zaun were elevated into a grander part of the city. This was known as Piltover.\n\nAfter years of being left behind, Zaun's name was besmirched over and over again, eventually loosing its name entirely to the modern generation. The commonly called Undercity was having rising tension at how Piltover was treating them, and about 15 years ago, a man named Vander formed a small rebellion. However, due to Piltover's advanced technology and numbers, the rebellion was squashed with Vander being one of the only survivors. \n \nPresent day Undercity is now overrun with chemical productions, body clinics that provide mechanical augmentations, and further tensions between Piltover and the Undercity. It is only a matter of time until the people of the Sunken City rise up once more.\n\nGovernment: Officially, Piltover's council governence also extends to the city of Zaun. In reality the Undercity is being ruled by Chem-Barons."

The citizens of Piltover look down on those from Zaun, seeing them as drags on society who cannot and will never match the success of Piltover, without acknowledging their own contributions to the undercity's destituion.\n\nSimilarly, many Zaunites despise Piltover and its people, viewing both as big reasons for the undercity's poor living conditions. \n\nFor the most part in history, this class divide has mostly been realized as a cold war of sorts. Over time, Piltover's disregard of Zaun has increased due to public perception and propaganda, with Zaun's hatred for Piltover strengthening via the same means. That said, a conflict did boil over once. Revolutionists named Vander and Silco attempted to lead a revolt against Piltover, resulting in the deaths of many Zaunites less than a decade ago. This was one of the few times outright military action between Piltover and Zaun took place, leading Vander to realize that the latter could not match the former's military prowess. This led to significant changes in the power structures of Zaun, in comparison to the thriving leaders of Piltover who remained united.\n\nThe Piltover council makes choices for both Piltover and Zaun, but the latter is often disregarded as an afterthought. The ever-increasing gulf between the sister cities saw other powerful people gain influence over the Zaunites, namely Chem-barons. "

While this pact between the barons has given their researchers and inventors the leeway to push the bounds of their experiments at an accelerated rate, it has also caused the city to be run more like a corrupt corporate business than a fair society of law and order.\n\nthe most greedy and opportunistic of Zaun's people began vying for power, maneuvering their way through the dark underbelly to become the most powerful and affluent crime lords in the city. Although they were initially at each other's throats, these crime lords were eventually brought together under the leadership and vision of Silco, a tyrannical drug lord who ruled the undercity with a drug called shimmer and aspired to liberate Zaun from Piltover's oppressive control. Under Silco's influence, these crime lords became the first generation of chem-barons and through their intellect, influence, and chemical technology, they agreed to serve him as his underlings and divided the undercity amongst themselves.\n\nDue to the extreme economic inequality that exists between the two cities, the chem-barons live like royalty and regularly abuse their power to keep the poorer Zaunites in line, which has convinced Piltover's ruling houses to allow them to remain in control of the undercity regardless of how unethical and cruel their methods are. \n\nChem-Barons: Silco, Finn, Smeech, Chross, Madam Margot, Renata Glasc, and more.

          "content": "Hextech was invited by two scientists named Jayce Talis and Viktor.\n\nHextech fuses the elemental magic of the Material Realm with the raw power of the Spirit Realm. The primary shape associated with Hextech corresponds with a rune from Innovation Rune, which perhaps implies that it is indeed an idea - springing from Jayce's mind - that has been given physical form. If this is indeed the case, then the potential power of Hextech grows as more and more people are captured by the ideas it represents. Hextech is science fused with magic. That means it's unstable and unpredictable, and it's frankly unclear whether the laws of the physical realm still apply to it. Magical power is primarily manipulated through the use of runes. There are five basic rune \"paths\" in the game, linked to different colors: Precision= Yellow, Domination= Red, Sorcery= Purple, Resolve= Green, Inspiration= Blue. \n\nJayce saw these runes used by a sorcerer to create a portal, and he became captivated with this idea, attempting to recreate it. This corresponds with the shape of the portal generators he created, which matches with the inspiration rune. Hextech essentially refines the use of runes into a scientific system. Using the runes, Jayce and Viktor have learned to draw the power of the Physical and Spirit Realms into contained spheres, which he can then use as power sources for incredible technology. The initial spheres were unstable, and the slightest physical impact had the potential to cause a spontaneous, destructive energy release.\n\nThe Hexcore - also called an \"adaptive rune matrix\" - is the next evolution of Hextech. This is created by the addition of organic matter to the rune-casting process, and the Hexcore has the potential to grow, learn, evolve, and even infect although it has not been introduced to the public. \n\nJayce and Viktor through combined effort brought Hexgates into the city of Piltover, which is just the start of their many inventions under Hextech. These Hexgates give Piltover the ability to travel at immense speeds, making it easier to visit distant locations in no time with airships. "

Firelight members wear masks and use a device to distort their voices to hide their identities. They travel around on hoverboards, of Ekko's own design, and use makeshift weapons and other devices against Silco's goons.\n\nBanding together over their need to survive in the undercity without true support from Piltover, whose authorities were in Silco's pocket, the group also took in other children so as not to have them wandering around the Shimmer-infested streets.\n\nThe Firelights build a home in an area of Zaun where a seedling survived—a rare feat in the toxic air of Zaun. With Ekko's skills and inventions, the tree managed to thrive and grow. They built houses around the area and made a small, relatively happy community."
